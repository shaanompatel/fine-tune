[Chaos in the Deep][Space Station Inhabitants]: Ahhhh!
[Chaos in the Deep][Space Station Inhabitants]: What is that!?
[Chaos in the Deep][Asta]: Lead the evacuation, quickly!
[Chaos in the Deep][Arlan]: Ugh... go!
[Chaos in the Deep][March 7th]: Look out!
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Seems I came at a bad time.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: No no — I think you couldn't have timed it better.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: 23:47:15 system time. Very punctual, Kafka.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Elio always tells the exact future. So what's with the explosion just now? Was that also part of his script?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Uh-huh — "23:44:59 system time: The pulses from the explosion cause a massive breakdown from the master control system."
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: You did that?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: No, the Antimatter Legion did it. They completely invaded the space station two system hours ago.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: *whistle* Alright, so do we need to fight the Legion?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: I dunno. Elio didn't say anything about it, so it doesn't matter.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Got it. So from now on, I'll be in charge of this operation.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Copy. Can you let me have some fun this time? Our last few operations turned out to be pretty dull.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: ...Sorry, I'm afraid there's not much I can do for you — our task this time is just to "place" the target properly.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: But if you wanna go look for some fun yourself, I won't stop you. I mean, after all...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: After all...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Elio didn't put it in the script.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Why would it matter?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Who's this? Herta?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Yeah.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: She looks so young. She was already famous in the last Amber Era, no? She has to be at least a hundred years old.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: She's a member of the Genius Society and an Emanator of Nous the Erudition. She can probably age backwards if she wanted.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Hah. I seem to recall that over half of the Genius Society's eighty-odd members had a normal death. Wasn't there someone who only lived for a dozen days or so? What was their name...
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: That's pretty normal. Aren't the immortal bosses in games always waiting for the protagonist to come kill them? Immortality is not always a good thing.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Hah. What an Alliance joke.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: This is Madam Herta, or better known as member 83 of the Genius Society. In her childhood, she solved the solitary waves theory and the Spark model hypothesis. In her adolescence, she found the Sigma Baryons conversion method. In middle-age, she proposed the Herta sequence and published a paper on de-aging.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: In her senior years, she managed to reverse her own age via de-aging, and went on to solve the mystery of the imaginary leakage phenomenon, and even captured and sealed a stellaron. Madam Herta has saved the planet she was on from destruction 19 times and has met the Aeons twice.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: This space station is her property.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: When did the Antimatter Legion become so weak?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: I could only attract this much. Did you really want the entire Legion to come here?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: This lot won't be able to slow down the Astral Express crew.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Relax. A Doomsday Beast is also here.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: This is Zandar. Zandar One Kuwabara. The first genius in history.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: The one who supposedly created Nous?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: That's him... If the legends are true, then he was a man who created an Aeon.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Well they better be false. I don't want to be a Zandar hunter.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Zandar One Kuwabara, Genius Society member 1. I hung up his portrait purely out of respect. Without him, there would be no Genius Society today.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Frankly, I don't know what he has achieved. None of his books and inventions have survived, but there's gotta be a place for the founder of the Society, right?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: ...I know this person. She's the Lord of Silence, Polka Kakamond. See? Her face is all blank. She had destroyed all of her own portraits and sculptures in the entire universe...
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: I'm not interested. Hurry up with our real business.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Polka Kakamond, member #4 of the Genius Society. A woman full of mystery. Many people in the Society died by her hand. I haven't heard anything about her for many years, but I firmly believe she is still alive.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Hey, Lord of Silence, if you're here, if you're listening... I'm member 83, Herta, and I want to meet you. I believe you and I will have a lot to talk about.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Who's this?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: No idea.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: This is Aiden, member 22 of the Genius Society. The most selfless and the strangest one. He spent his whole life helping others. Personally, I don't see the point.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: But the Society is famous thanks to him. The Interastral Peace Corporation has been trying to find a replacement ever since his death. They searched for many Amber Eras, but no genius was willing to lower their head to the IPC... Until they found me.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Who's this old guy with a white beard?
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: No idea. A Society member?
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Oh, Elias Salas, such a lovely old fellow. He is Member 56 of the Genius Society, one of the only two publicly elected Ministers in the Society's history. Be grateful to him! He created the Synesthesia Beacons and over-range remote sensing, the cornerstones of modern cosmic communication.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: However, he did not disclose his inventions to the public, so I hereby certify that the rights of these two technologies belong to the Intelligentsia Guild. To be honest, I am not a big fan of the Guild, but it is impressive that they managed to reproduce Elias Salas' inventions.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Hey! Silver Wolf! Look! It's Screwllum, your good old opponent.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Hahhhh... I told you already. I didn't know it was him...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Ah, that battle was how Elio got his eyes on you. Imagine, someone actually able to crack Screwllum's code! First Screwllum, then Herta... there's probably no one else in the universe who offended two genii in such quick succession. It must be destiny.
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Urgh... Seems like I'm the real Destiny's Slave here.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Member 76 of the Genius Society, Screwllum. I have known him for a long time. He is a really good man, a gentleman with an exceptional mechanical mind. I have learned a lot from him.
[Chaos in the Deep][Herta]: Recently, I have been working with him and Ruan Mei on a project! I hope this project can help us get closer to the greatest mystery of the universe...
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Cleaning up other people's mess isn't in my job description...
[Chaos in the Deep][???]: Y'know Kafka?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: *sigh* Yeah, yeah. Where did you send it, Silver Wolf?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Some random coordinates, not important. You care about where that Voidranger ended up?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Of course not~ I'm just amazed at this fancy technique of yours, as usual.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Just a little trick of tampering with the data of reality, I wouldn't call it fancy.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: What were you looking at so intently just now? Let me see.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Herta's toys, a catalog featuring the space station's collection of rare items. They've got a lot of interesting gadgets.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Like what?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: There's this gun, it can rate any creature within its crosshair as a score from 0 to 100.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: ...Doesn't sound very interesting.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Aren't you curious about how much you would score? I kinda wanna know mine.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Fine, I guess we can swing by and play with it if it's not too far. What's our destination?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Go down the corridor behind the door on the left. There's a room where some kind of rare item is stored.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: So that's where the Stellaron is?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: That's where we can find out where the Stellaron is.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Herta... Have you ever met her? I'm curious about the tastes of someone who used their own name for a space station.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Never seen the real one. Saw plenty of her portraits, though.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: What a pity.
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Welcome to Herta Space Station. Here, you can savor the bounty of the ocean of knowledge. Please also beware of the risk of drowning.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Now, this hint is useless.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Who knows what's in the brains of those following the Erudition?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: The central area of the space station is up ahead. There will be lots of Legion Voidrangers there.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Okay~
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Hold it.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Someone, or something, is up ahead.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Looks like we're the ones getting ambushed.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: But they're the ones getting besieged.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Not a single soul here. Impressive evacuation work. Did Herta organize it herself?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: According to the access history, she hasn't logged in here for over six months. The evacuation was directed by the acting lead researcher — a girl named Asta.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Doesn't ring a bell. Oh, right, Elio said we wouldn't run into Herta. It seems she really isn't here.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Where's the Stellaron?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Elio's script doesn't include any info about the location of the Stellaron, which means in the future he foresees...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: ...We would find the Stellaron in a non-physical way?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: This space station is packed with extraordinary objects, I wouldn't be surprised if there's one that can make it happen.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Hiding something extraordinary with something extraordinary... this is pretty Herta. I assume you know what to do? I mean, you've read that catalog for quite a while.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: I've got all the clues we need. The only piece missing is a simple trick.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Help me investigate the terminal in this room, our item might be inside.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Okay, the stage is yours~
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Help me investigate the terminal in this room, our item might be inside.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: I can see the whole space station on the surveillance screen... but not the Stellaron.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Even if you could, it'd be a trap. Herta doesn't display her collections.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Huh? I can't see the memory storage for this terminal...
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: This is the monitoring room, they must have deleted the records and made a run for it. Classic.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: *sigh* Make your way over here then, there's no point in trying to search like this.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: So, got a master plan? I'm all ears.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: It's a matter of hacking the surveillance system directly.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Aha, I see. Herta's collections aren't in the system, so anything unaffected should be our target.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Simple, crude, but effective. Look, found it.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Huh. What's this?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Item number 211, "Blind Spot": A simple light-deflecting field. It allows an object in its field to pass unnoticed, but if a different item ceases to be obvious, the object gets revealed.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: So Herta hides her collection with something as simple as this?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: The simplest method is the hardest to spot, isn't that our motto?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: *whistle* Strange thing number two...
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: The data suggests it's just an ordinary hologram. But it has an added layer...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Let's take a look. Don't worry, this place won't be our grave.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Interesting, she's a member of the Genius Society alright.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: The Stellaron is up ahead, let's hurry.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: It has its own security system... I guess even for Herta, a Stellaron is no ordinary rarity.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Can you get it?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Of course, even the genius Herta can't compete with me when it comes to hacking.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Good, then I'll also count on you with the preparation of the receptacle.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: The receptacle's ready
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Your decision.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Elio said this decision will bring about lots of changes.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: He also said, it must be you who makes it.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Why are you standing around? Having second thoughts?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Yeah. We've always been the ones taking Stellarons. It's the first time we're giving one out.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: You're gonna think for this long? Didn't make up your mind when you got out of bed this morning?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Don't hurry me, Silver Wolf. This is a big decision.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Come on, I'll pick for you! This one, yeah, this one!
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Uh, Silver Wolf? Did you forget that I must be the one to make this decision?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Wanna give  a new name?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: There we go.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: How much does  remember?
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: ...They'll remember you.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Time to get up.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: ...
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Where... am I?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: A space station, but that's not important.
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Kafka...?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Great, so you remember me.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: ...
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Who... are you?
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: I thought you'd remember me.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: Maybe you're not as important as you think.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Listen: You are in a daze right now. You don't know who you are, why you're here, or what you're going to do next. You think I look familiar, but you're not sure if you should trust me—
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: ...None of that matters. All you need to know is that I'm leaving, and you will be left all alone on this space station. From now on, you needn't think about your past or doubt yourself.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Listen: In the near future, you will encounter all kinds of perils and hardships, but you will also have many wonderful experiences. You'll meet companions who treat you like family, and embark on surreal adventures with them...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: At the end of your journey, all that perplexes you and troubles you will resolve.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: This is your future that Elio has foreseen. Do you like it?
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: I guess...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Lovely.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Listen: Remember what you're feeling in this moment. As long as you know in your heart where you're heading, you are guaranteed to see the ending of your story.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: That's the you I like.
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: No... I don't want it...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Listen: Elio can foresee the future, but he can't make decisions for you.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: Use that will of yours to reach the end of your story. That's the you I like.
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Where are you going...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: The next stop, to pave the way for the future that is written.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: It's like weaving brocade — you and I can only add one gold thread each time, but eventually, we will make a gorgeous pattern.
[Chaos in the Deep][Silver Wolf]: How long do you think you need? According to the script, the Astral Express crew is arriving soon. We should avoid being seen by them.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: I know, Silver Wolf. Just give me another minute.
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: I must leave now. Listen: Don't worry. Someone will come and find you very soon, just go with them. You won't remember a thing except me.
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: No...
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Farewell...
[Chaos in the Deep][Narration]: Kafka...
[Chaos in the Deep][Kafka]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret...

[Eye of the Storm][Male Voice]: Weren't their coordinates sent out from the space station...?
[Eye of the Storm][Female Voice]: Who cares? They're here and alive. Do they look like a mannequin to you?
[Eye of the Storm][Male Voice]: ...Weak heartbeat and pulse... March, you better do CPR.
[Eye of the Storm][Female Voice]: Huh!? Hehe... I—I've never done it before! Dan Heng, you do it!
[Eye of the Storm][Female Voice]: Wait — stop it!
[Eye of the Storm][Female Voice]: They're awake!
[Eye of the Storm][???]: Are you all right? Can you hear me? Do you remember your name?
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: I... don't remember a thing.
[Eye of the Storm][???]: Aw, this isn't good... Can you try harder? I'm sure you can at least remember your name...
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: My name is .
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: ? Nice to meet you. My name's Dan Heng, and this is March 7th.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: This space station was just attacked by the Antimatter Legion. We came to help with the rescue at the request of Lead Researcher Asta.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: The Antimatter Legion?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Goons owned by the Destruction. You're lucky that the most dangerous Lord Ravager among them isn't around, just some nasty minions.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: We'll take those invaders out soon, don't worry.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Lead Researcher Asta?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Uh-huh, a petite cutie with pink hair. Madam Herta appointed her to be the acting lead researcher.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: ...That girl really needs to step up. I can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name...
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Where should I go?
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Back to the master control zone. Asta and the other researchers have gathered there.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Plus that's where we parked the Astral Express! Don't you worry, we'll protect you from the monsters and clear up this mess.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Who are you guys?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Dan Heng and I are members of the Astral Express crew~
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Well the Express has some dealings with Madam Herta, so we come to visit the space station from time to time.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: We just so happened to arrive during this... invasion. Of course, as a — ahem — crew of heroes, we're happy to lend a hand.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: The Astral Express?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Yeah, you've never seen it? The Express comes here every once in a while.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: It's a unique train that can travel between the stars with the power of the Trailblaze Aeon.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: I'll show you once we're back to the master control zone~
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Let's go then.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: You and March go back together.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Arlan from the Security Department lost contact in the vicinity. I need to find him first.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Oh, all right. You stay safe.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: , maybe you should take this.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: The Legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves — this trip won't be a walk in the park. It's better if you have something to protect yourself.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Just a suggestion though — you're safe as long as you stick with me~!
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: This place is full of fancy little gadgets — Herta's collection. I really don't get why she'd go out of her way to collect them and then leave them here to gather dust...
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Ah, it's the Antimatter Legion! So these crazy jerks made it all the way here... Watch this!
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: You're stronger than you look... Seem to be quite the fighter.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: So we'll take that elevator on the central platform to go down to the master control zone. Do you know the way?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Um, I notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. Do you really work here?
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Yes.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: ...Really? Feels like you're tricking me...
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: I don't remember.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: ...Memory loss, huh. You must've been injured.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: ...
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: ...Never mind. I won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Let's go, I'll take you to the safe zone~
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Ah. I knew it...
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: It worked?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Nah, I think the elevator's broken. I pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: It's broken?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: —But it wasn't me! The Antimatter Legion must've broken it!
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Too bad Dan Heng's not here. He's like a walking encyclopedia... He knows a ton of complicated stuff — maybe even elevator repair...
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I don't know that one.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Whoa! Why are you here!? ...And how did you get here before us?
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I took another route to the upper level, and I saw you guys from up there.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Arlan is in the control room. He's been injured, but not fatally.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: You found him! Will he know what to do about this elevator?
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I suppose as the head of the Security Department, he should know.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Then let's go talk to him!
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Hey... you're all together?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Yep, we're from the Astral Express~
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Oh... Did Madam Herta send you to help?
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: It's just a coincidence. We came to deliver the rare relic Herta trusted us to find... We didn't expect to arrive during an invasion.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Why is the Antimatter Legion targeting you guys? It seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: I... have no idea. The Legion came at a very suspicious time — almost right after the security system suddenly failed.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Lady... Lead Researcher Asta immediately began to organize the evacuation. I was supposed to cover everyone as they evacuated, but... I didn't expect to end up failing in this task.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Don't be too hard on yourself. Your leg and dominant hand were injured. It was a wise decision to hide here and avoid a head-on encounter with the Legion.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Yeah! Most of the staff have been evacuated safely, so right now our highest priority is to return to the master control zone and plan a counterattack! So... do you know how to use the elevator? I couldn't start it...
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: After the evacuation was complete, the elevators were all shut down to keep the Legion away from the master control zone.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Since Lady Asta sent you to look for me, I assume she must've given you the encryption key for accessing the elevator system?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Oh, right, she did give me some sort of card...
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: ...March...
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: But where did I put it...
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: You...
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Ah! Here it is!
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I...
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: ...Now that we found the key, we should get going. We can use that console over there to unlock the elevator.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Let's go.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Hold on. I only activated the elevator on the highest floor. We'll have to go there to use it.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Why? It's so far away.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Because I mustn't give the Legion any chance to reach the master control zone by the elevator. I must ensure the safety of the station's staff.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: So I'll have to trouble you to take a bit of a detour... Apologies.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Okay.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Sorry... This space station was entrusted to Lady Asta by Madam Herta. I must do this for the safety of the master control zone and the staff there.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: So I'll have to trouble you to take a bit of a detour... Sincerest apologies.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Huh? You're not coming with us?
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: My leg is injured... I'd only slow you down. I'll stay here and shut down the elevator once you've made it to the master control zone.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: You won't slow us down. And you should be able to shut down the elevators from the master control zone, right?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Agreed.  and I made it here safely, and now we've also got Dan Heng. We're more than enough to protect you~
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Let us worry about the Antimatter Legion. You just follow us and keep yourself alive~
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Trust us.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: Don't overthink this.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: You can use me as a crutch.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Aren't you a nice kid!
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: ...Thank you.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Do you know why the Antimatter Legion would invade the station, Arlan?
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: They must've come for Madam Herta's collection... But as to why, I still...
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I heard there's something called a Stellaron in Madam Herta's collection.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: ...That's not the kind of information someone in my position would have access to.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: The repulsion bridge has been shut down?
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: Yes. To stall the enemy, more or less.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Hey, these shiny things... Are these Light Cones? I thought only the Interastral Peace Corporation had rare stuff like this.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: No, Light Cones are Garden of Recollection technology. They allow you to carry memories around — very potent enhancement items. I heard the corporation paid a lot for the usage rights, but I've no idea how Herta managed to get hold of one.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: They were acquired legitimately, that's all I can say. Take them, they're very useful in combat.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Is that it? We've reached the elevator already? That wasn't too many monsters~
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Oof, probably shouldn't have said that... Might bring bad luck.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: You've grown, March.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Hey, sore losers
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: You can't just gang up on us!
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Go!
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: Why does it always have to get this exciting?
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: Anyway, at least you're back.
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: March, Dan Heng, you've been through a lot.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Whew, Himeko~ What took you so long! That last wave of Antimatter Legion came at us like a swarm of locusts, have you ever tried shooting locusts with a bow?
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: I wouldn't have made a difference. My orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but I couldn't just blow up the space station with it — Herta would NOT like that...
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: Are you alright, Arlan? Asta's been worried about you.
[Eye of the Storm][Arlan]: I'm fine, a quick patching up will do. Thanks for asking. I'll report the situation to Lead Researcher Asta immediately. Bye.
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Himeko, navigator of the Astral Express.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: In other words, she's in charge of where the Express goes.
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: March hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: , think carefully about how you wanna reply to that.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: I've never met a more reckless girl in my life.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: ...That's just my charm! And I didn't cause any trouble. You just have to get used to me... Look, Dan Heng agrees, right?
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I have the right to remain silent.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: I've never met a more lively girl in my life.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: Well, that's the joy of youth! We should take every step forward full of energy!  a discerning one, isn't , Dan Heng?
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: I have the right to remain silent.
[Eye of the Storm][Narration]: In that case, I'd rather not answer.
[Eye of the Storm][March 7th]: ...Oh, looks like we have two Dan Hengs on our team now.
[Eye of the Storm][Dan Heng]: Please leave me out of this.
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: Haha, look at you all, you've already gotten really close.
[Eye of the Storm][Himeko]: Come on, Asta has been worried about all of you.

[A Moment of Peace][Distressed Researcher]: I'm still young. I don't wanna die!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Distressed Researcher]: Why did the Antimatter Legion suddenly come here? I don't wanna die here! Mom, dad, my sweet angel... I miss you so much.
[A Moment of Peace][Distressed Researcher]: I, I'm too young to die! I've got things I still want to achieve on this space station.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Rocky]: Lesley! Sir, I need to go. I need to go find Lesley.
[A Moment of Peace][Bernard]: Stupid boy, is your head not screwed on right? You're leaving over my dead body.
[A Moment of Peace][Bernard]: I'll knock some sense into you yet... Hey, where do you think you're go— Argh...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Emily]: Emily, calm down and think about what she would do in such a disaster. Ten cups of coffee? A pill? Or maybe hide in a room full of Mystic Scrolls of Aeons?
[A Moment of Peace][Emily]: ...
[A Moment of Peace][Emily]: ...That's bitter coffee... *coughing* ...so bitter.
[A Moment of Peace][Emily]: Too dang bitter!!!
[A Moment of Peace][Emily]: Oh sis, where are you? I'm so scared...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Wen Shiling]: *crying* What should we do!? They said there are monsters in the storage zone. And the gift I prepared for Master Capote is still in the analysis room of the Department of Implement Arts...
[A Moment of Peace][Adler]: You know, there's loads of monsters attacking the space station this time, and some of them aren't even on the station's records—
[A Moment of Peace][Wen Shiling]: *crying* You're so annoying, stop saying that! *crying*
[A Moment of Peace][Adler]: Hey, how old are you? Don't be a baby!
[A Moment of Peace][Adler]: Please stop crying. *gasp* How about I pretend to be a monster for you, huh?
[A Moment of Peace][Adler]: Raaaawr!
[A Moment of Peace][Wen Shiling]: Waaaah!
[A Moment of Peace][Anxious Researcher]: Is the report done?
[A Moment of Peace][Hamstrung Researcher]: Ack, it's a long story.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Anxious Researcher]: That report I asked you to write before... how is it?
[A Moment of Peace][Hamstrung Researcher]: I finished it two days back, but y'know... well, it's a long story.
[A Moment of Peace][Anxious Researcher]: So what exactly is going on?
[A Moment of Peace][Hamstrung Researcher]: Just as we were running a seminar, the Antimatter Legion invaded. The old fella sitting in front of me was wounded in action, and I was scared half to death.
[A Moment of Peace][Anxious Researcher]: Wow, that's rough. Thank goodness you're okay.
[A Moment of Peace][Hamstrung Researcher]: Yeah, just a little unlucky. I need to re-write it.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Mare]: That's right... that's right. "The resentful spirit's senseless obsession turns into a tangible hand, and the shadow of the old disaster will conceal the heavens!"
[A Moment of Peace][Mare]: That's exactly what was written on the Mystic Scroll of Aeons. It refers to the followers of Nanook the Destruction using antimatter to create a galactic weapon of war.
[A Moment of Peace][Mare]: I didn't think I'd be fortunate enough to witness... hehehehe...
[A Moment of Peace][Mare]: Oh, have you also come to witness the power and miracle of the Aeons? Then go over there, there's a good spot right there.
[A Moment of Peace][Mare]: Beware of any interferences from your mortal body when observing... you must seize every detail. When an Aeon appears, even the tiniest trace must not be missed. Hehehe...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Listen
[A Moment of Peace][Gunn]: You see that, Sheila? History always repeats itself.
[A Moment of Peace][Sheila]: History? Gunn, this is the first time I have witnessed the space station in such disarray.
[A Moment of Peace][Gunn]: Oh Sheila, when we face another dire crisis like this, if you're able to rescue your home planet... Will you come back and save us?
[A Moment of Peace][Sheila]: Home planet? My home planet? ...I do not understand what you are saying.
[A Moment of Peace][Gunn]: Never mind. If Sheila could hear this, she'd understand.
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: We researchers have all taken refuge here, but has anyone given any thought to the non-human life on this space station?
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: They may be part of the rare item collection, but are they not also living things? Don't their rights deserve to be protected!?
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Non-human life?
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Yes. Non. Human. Life. Living creatures that aren't human...
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: ...Some of which have been collected as rare items and housed in the space station. Most of the researchers disregard their basic rights.
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Even now, with death staring them in the face, they still refuse to open their minds.
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: And I, Lukacs, outstanding researcher of the Herta Department of Galactic Geopolitics, must awaken those pretending to sleep!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Rare item collection?
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: At the space station, we've always collected rare items — countless articles from across the galaxy. But not everyone knows that among these articles are also living things.
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: And I, Lukacs, outstanding researcher of the Herta Department of Galactic Geopolitics, must emphasize in this time of crisis that their lives and rights should also be respected!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Protecting their rights?
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Exactly! And I, Lukacs, outstanding researcher of the Herta Department of Galactic Geopolitics, shall continue fighting and speaking up for the rights of all non-human life in these terrible times!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: If you are interested in joining the cause, please stand by my side and repeat after me!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Protect rare item rights! Save non-human life!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: All together! Protect rare item rights...!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Protect rare item rights!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: You did well, friend! Follow my rhythm, and say it loud, with conviction!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Perfect, my friend. Now let us work together and invite more supporters to join us!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I think I should leave.
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Hmph! Just another egocentric anthropocentrist!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Open your benighted eyes and look at the delicate life around you!
[A Moment of Peace][Lukacs]: Protect rare item rights! Save non-human life!
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Projectile radar tracking, normal. Telemetry signal frequency unusually high! Maintain at normal levels!
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Our measurements predict that the Legion is about to unleash over ten waves of continuous attacks. Everyone, brace yourselves!
[A Moment of Peace][March 7th]: Asta! We're back!
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Whew, I'm glad you're all back safe. Arlan just told me about the situation at the storage zone — and about his injury... thank you, for all your help.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: In times of disaster, I realize more and more that the space station's researchers are its most valuable assets... Alas, we were ill-prepared for such emergencies... we should have built up our security and combat departments.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: On the other hand, the entire crew of the Astral Express seems to be extraordinarily skilled.
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: What is the current situation on the space station?
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: The situation is under control for now. The damage to our security system was minor. The intruder only managed to alter a small amount of data, so it was easy to fix.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: The real problem lies with the researchers... They trust Madam Herta wholeheartedly and never thought that the space station would be breached by the Legion. A broken spirit is far worse than a broken body.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Let's go speak with the researchers. Right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. Have you tried contacting Herta?
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I sent multiple letters, all met with silence. You know her, Himeko, the space station is but a mere warehouse for followers and rare items. She doesn't really care about it.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: I knew it... No matter. I'll also send a letter to Herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. At least that might get her attention.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: That would be of great help.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Open Warp
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: You can obtain characters and Light Cones from Warps.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Make 1 Warp.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Hello, you must be... , right? How can I help you?
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I'd like to learn about the space station.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: This is Herta Space Station. As you might tell from its name, it belongs to the distinguished Madam Herta herself.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Herta Space Station was originally built as a warehouse for rare items and relics, but Madam Herta also allowed her followers to oversee tasks and conduct research. It then gradually turned into a scientific research base.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: The storage zone you passed through contains all our inventory, and is the main research center.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: The master control zone where we are now is the control center of the whole space station.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: It is said that the space station also contains Madam Herta's private chamber where her most precious, rare, and dangerous collections are sealed... And for someone like her, it's not out of the realm of possibility.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Even from me, the lead researcher, there are many things she keeps secret.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I'd like to learn about you.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I'm lead researcher of Herta Space Station. But honestly... I'm more like Madam Herta's "housekeeper" of this place.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Madam Herta is a genius, but managing disparate staff, tactfully representing the space station before the Intelligentsia Guild... these are all things beyond her abilities. But as it turns out they are my forte.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Hehe, scholars are a lot easier to deal with than those vociferous old geezers back at home.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: No matter how much they drone on about "Astronomy is just about looking at things, it doesn't bring any real value," they all fall silent in front of Madam Herta.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: No matter the problem, you just needed to say that it was Madam Herta's wishes and all would be fine. After all, Herta herself is a symbol of wisdom.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Hey, thanks to her, I can count the stars to sleep. Otherwise, I would've had to take over the family fortune. Just thinking about it terrifies me.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I'd like to learn about Arlan.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Arlan went to dress his wounds at the rest area. He knows himself well... but if he insists on pushing his limits, I'll give him a good earful.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I'm very upset he didn't obey my orders and insisted on searching the storage zone even though everyone had already evacuated.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I know he didn't want to leave any researchers behind... The Security Department is more than just a job to him.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: But Arlan doesn't care about getting hurt, he only cares about protecting others. It's the only way he feels... fulfilled.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: And it's not that I don't understand where he's coming from. I just want him to look out for himself, too!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I'd like to learn about Herta.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Herta... she's a member of the Genius Society. One of the proud favorites of the Aeon of Erudition. Ever since the birth of Nous, there have only been 84 people admitted into the Genius Society.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: That is why Madam Herta is extremely... headstrong... She only pursues what interests her and as soon as that interest is lost, she abandons it and moves on. The space station was one such abandoned interest...
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Anyway, I lent out one of her manuscripts as a resource reference not long ago. It should still be in the master control zone. You can take a look if you wish.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Huh, chatting with you seems to have lightened my mood. It seems like talking can really raise one's spirits.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: What's the matter, ? You seem to have something on your mind.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I'd like to learn about the Astral Express.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. But more specifically, the Astral Express was a creation of the Aeon, Akivili the Trailblazer.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: As for what the Trailblaze, the Aeons, and Akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. I don't wanna overwhelm you now, do I?
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I'd like to learn about Light Cones.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Light Cones were created by the Garden of Recollection. These followers of the Aeon of Remembrance refined memory fragments to create Light Cones, which preserve memories.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: But you've already realized it, haven't you? Since Light Cones can preserve memories, they can also preserve experiences and abilities. That's why Light Cones are extremely precious rare items under level-2 restriction by the Interastral Peace Corporation.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: As far as I know, only the IPC possesses Light Cone technology authorized by the Garden of Recollection. I couldn't say what deal Herta made with the Garden, but knowing her, it was likely off the books...
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: You should cherish every Light Cone. They are all precious memories of their original owners.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Do you... know who I am?
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: I have a couple of hunches, but I can't prove any at this point. So, they'll be my little secrets for now.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Are you concerned about your past? You seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back... Or maybe I'm just describing myself.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Come to me anytime if you have more questions.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I'll leave the reassurance of the researchers in your hands.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: If you have any other questions, you are welcome to come to Himeko and me.
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: ...If only I'd caught the Antimatter Legion sooner...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: How're you feeling?
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: I'm fine, this pain is nothing, really. I'm used to it. In fact, I should be proud of it. It's a reminder of being able to protect everyone.
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: Ahem, but don't tell Lead Researcher Asta what I just said.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: How's the space station?
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: There were a few researchers who didn't make it...
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: The rest are fine, mostly minor injuries. But I'm worried about their mental states.
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: Most of them came to the space station because they admired Madam Herta. But now they can't reach her or even their own families. I just hope they can all survive this crisis.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: What's Asta like?
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: My first impression was that she was the daughter of a rich family — owners of a big company.
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: She was kind to me though. When she went to the space station, I followed her.
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: I don't know much about science, but I'm glad to be able to protect people in pursuit of their research.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Alright, I'll leave you to get some rest.
[A Moment of Peace][Arlan]: I hope all this chaos will end soon.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: Why did those monsters have to breach the ionizing grid on my watch...
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: It can't be my fault, I'd never make a mistake like this... I'm going out there to check the data again!
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: You're injured.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: Injured? I don't care, see anyone else that cares? Who are you anyway, get out of my way.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: It's dangerous outside.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: Dangerous? Of course it's dangerous, I just came back from the front line, I know that better than you.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Don't be a hero.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: Hero? Don't overthink it. I'm not doing this for others, I'm doing it for myself.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: The space station shield's first line of defense is the anti-gravity ionizing grid. I'm the researcher in charge of it. Do you expect me to just sit here after something like this?
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: It's not your fault.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: I agree. But when the investigation's over, the blame will fall entirely on my shoulders.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: It's over now.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: That may be the case, but it's better than just hiding here doing nothing.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Please, just stay here.
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: Hmph... it's easy for you to say! This didn't happen on your watch, you wouldn't understand!
[A Moment of Peace][Eikura Shuu]: Besides, that bunch of troublemakers is still out there... I know you mean well, but I've made up my mind.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Push the stick down, Alfred... Sorry, sorry, I got the wrong person.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Let me help.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Thanks, kid. We're doing some pre-checks for the satellite remote sensing. I'll hold down the button to monitor the signal, and you push the control stick according to my instructions.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: But first let's talk about the controls. "Up" is the spectrometer, "Down" is the filter, "Left" is the reference level, and "Right" is the attenuator.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Our pre-checks have three steps. Turning on the spectrometer, then the attenuator, and finally outputting the signal to the filter.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: It's quite a bit to remember... You got everything?
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Got it.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Could you repeat that again?
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Don't worry, I'll go over it again.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: The controls are "Up" for the spectrometer, "Down" for the filter, "Left" for the reference level, and "Right" for the attenuator.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: The pre-checks have three steps. Turning on the spectrometer, then the attenuator, and finally outputting the signal to the filter.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Are you ready? Three, two, one...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Up, down, left
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Wrong order, kid. Let me demonstrate.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Push the control stick up to activate the spectrometer, then right for the attenuator, and finally down for the filter.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Down, up, right
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Wrong order, kid. Let me demonstrate.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Push the control stick up to activate the spectrometer, then right for the attenuator, and finally down for the filter.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Up, right, down
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Wonderful, thank you.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: That was very helpful of you, kid. Alfred was the researcher in charge of this — he was in the storage zone earlier... He didn't make it back.
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: Abraham was close to him. I don't know how to tell him about it...
[A Moment of Peace][Hinkel]: The top priority is to preserve the space station and concentrate on the work at hand.
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: I need to leave, I need to run from this forsaken...
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: No, it's impossible. I can run from yesterday, I can run from today, but tomorrow will always be one step ahead of me...
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: Look, the obstacle detection terminal has recorded 142,856 attacks... the next count will be 142,857!
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: I know in my heart that when I see that hopelessly beautiful cyclic number... it will mean the poetic end of my life's cycle.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Things will get better.
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: Everyone keeps saying that. "Things will get better, things won't always be this bad."
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: Negative... positive... A negative of a negative is a positive.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Life is but a path to death, but not today.
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: Life is but a path to death, but not today... How insightful. Yes, of course! The closer you approach death, the more you appreciate life.
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: I will pull myself together. Thank you, that was kind of you.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Life is but a path to death, but not today.
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: How insightful, yes of course. The closer you approach death, the more you appreciate life.
[A Moment of Peace][Abraham]: I will pull myself together. Thank you, that was kind of you.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Open the Travel Log to see the events that are currently happening.
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: Complete objectives in the Travel Log to receive corresponding rewards.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: Take the Express and leave.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I'll stay.
[A Moment of Peace][March 7th]: But...
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Let's go.
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: The supply zone's defense shield won't hold much longer. You all need to hurry...
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: I'll be here, you've got to fend them off...
[A Moment of Peace][Asta]: You... hurry...
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: ...We lost communications.
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: Are you thinking of going back? Let me remind you, that's the Doomsday Beast, the Legion's planet destroyer.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: The space station is Herta's creation. As long as a Lord Ravager doesn't intervene, there should be no problems.
[A Moment of Peace][March 7th]: B—But we can't just run away like this, right...
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: The Doomsday Beast can rip off the defense shield like tearing paper — and Herta's not here. The station's defenses are too weak to stand against the Antimatter Legion.
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: Either way, the Legion has the blessing of the Aeon, Nanook. They came prepared and everyone here is not.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: That's why we have to leave and take  with us.
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: ?
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: ... that important?
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: the one who can help us turn the tides... Of course, I may be wrong.
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: ...As you say so. Alright, what should we do next?
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: This is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. There's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. Let's head over there and meet up with Welt.
[A Moment of Peace][March 7th]: Mr. Yang? Mr. Yang's here too? Didn't he stay on the Express?
[A Moment of Peace][Dan Heng]: The Astral Express tracks our coordinates in real time... And with such a huge change in the space station's movements, there's no way Mr. Yang wouldn't have noticed.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Hmm, I can almost guarantee that your Mr. Yang is already on his way.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the Doomsday Beast. But, if the Destruction's Emanator were to appear...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I... can't handle...
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: The Destruction's Emanator?
[A Moment of Peace][Narration]: I still feel that things won't be going as planned.
[A Moment of Peace][Himeko]: Let's hurry up and get out of here. I'll explain later.

[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: The exit's over there... how do we get to it?
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Aww yeah, it's the platform!
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: ...The Express isn't here.
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: It has to be nearby! Let me go take a peek with my sharp eyes.
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: Wait, March!
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: The Doomsday Beast...
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: It's really here.
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Hey! Get down here!
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Careful everyone.
[Lingering Shadows][Astral Express Crew]: March!
[Lingering Shadows][???]: I must leave now
[Lingering Shadows][Trailblazer]: What happened...
[Lingering Shadows][???]: You must see the end of your story.
[Lingering Shadows][Trailblazer]: ...Who is that?
[Lingering Shadows][???]: Reach the end of the story in your own way.
[Lingering Shadows][???]: See
[Lingering Shadows][???]: THEY have already noticed you.
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Mr. Yang! Is ...
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Welt They're okay now
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Welt Let's talk somewhere else.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: :
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Hello there~
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Not bad. It would've been even better if you didn't faint. But thanks to you, the Doomsday Beast was as tame as a kitten. It had no temper at all.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Did we win?
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Yes, and you are the hero.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Even the Doomsday Beast is no match...
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Alright, alright. I just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. However, you are indeed the hero this time.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Who am I, where am I...
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Er, you are kidding, right...?
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Get up when you feel better. Himeko wants you to go find her. I have something to do, so I won't go with you, alright?
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: By the way, we should exchange beacons. If you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: You exchanged your cell phone number with March 7th.
[Lingering Shadows][March 7th]: Okay, off I go. Bye!
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: Hi.
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: It's good that you've made it through in one piece. You can rest easy now that the threat from the Legion has been neutralized.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Did we win?
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: Well, this invasion seems to be nothing more than a random provocation. As soon as the Doomsday Beast fell, the Legion retreated.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Even the Doomsday Beast is no match...
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: You're not wrong, but be careful about blurting things out loud — it could attract unwanted attention.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Who am I, where am I...
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: Well, this is the Herta Space Station.
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: I guess I'll leave you to rest up a bit for the time being. By the way, what's your beacon address? That way if anything happens, I can contact you.
[Lingering Shadows][Dan Heng]: Go see Himeko when you have the time. She said she had something to discuss with you.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: You're awake. I had March and Dan Heng stay by the Express to keep an eye on things.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: It's almost time. She should be arriving any moment now.
[Lingering Shadows][???]: I've only been gone, what? A few months? And the space station is already in this state?
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Welcome back, Herta.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: This is the true master of the space station — Genius Society number 83, Herta.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: At least give me a proper introduction! Genius Society number 83... Of all my outstanding achievements, that's what you want to mention?
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Space station... Herta...?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Yeah, up to speed yet? That place you all turned upside down? That's my property.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: You're... a robot?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: What you're seeing here is one of my puppets. I'm using her to talk to you.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Heh, Genius Society...
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Alright, laugh it up. That old Zandar came up with the name. You think I like it?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: So this little twerp has the Stellaron now? Huh.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Hmm, I'll have to take a good look.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Hmm, truly amazing! I built a whole space station just to contain this unactivated Stellaron and keep The Blue from disaster...
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Yet someone was able to achieve that with this little twerp's body. How did they do it?
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Moreover, the Stellaron is still very stable in 's body.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: You're right. This little one's body truly is strange...
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Don't call me "little one."
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Hah! Compared to me, you are. How old are you even?
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Don't judge a book by its cover, Herta. Case in point, that puppet body of yours is actually much smaller than .
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: That's... beside the point. Hey is this one the same kind as that March 7th? If that were true...
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: My name is .
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Alright, . I got it. But I'm still gonna call you little twerp. The space in my brain is too valuable to store peoples' names.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Oh! Well, thanks for remembering my name then.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: That's different. We have business with each other. Umm, what was your name again?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Forget it, let's focus on the one who can store a Stellaron in their body...
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Must you two discuss this right in front of me?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: You can leave. I'm discussing science with what's her face... Himeko? Science exists in objectivity, there's nothing to be secretive about.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: But as far as you're concerned, I think it would be better for you to listen in. After all, I have a lot of plans ahead involving you. Speaking of which, Himeko...
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Can I bring  in for some research?
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: That's not up to me to decide. You can ask  yourself...
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: No way!
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: This little twerp really has a temper. Don't worry, I won't hurt a hair on your head. With my skills, even surgery would be painless!
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Aren't you worried about that bomb inside of you? Let me help you while I'm still interested. Once I'm not, I won't do any studies even if you beg me.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Study what?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Study you of course. Your body contains a Stellaron, which, in some sense, is no different than storing a bomb. Who knows what might happen? Maybe it'll blow you to bits someday.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: You should be grateful that this genius is willing to help you out. I still have some interest now, but once that's gone, I'm not studying you even if you beg me.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: What's your price?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: This little twerp's pretty financially motivated. I like it.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Alright, give the poor child a break, Herta.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: I'm very interested now, so there's almost nothing I won't accommodate. A Stellaron in your body, how interesting is that! Be grateful that I'm offering to help you out. This is a service even the IPC can't buy.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: You understand now, ? Herta wants you to stay in her space station.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Well, I'm going to have to modify your wording here: This little twerp can only stay temporarily until the research is done. Or maybe I'll lose interest halfway through and they can just beat it.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: And after that?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Not my problem.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: ... You also have another option — the Astral Express. If you want, you can leave with us.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: The Express has its fair share of experiences with Stellarons. The thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. Besides...
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: We can come back any time to let Herta conduct her research. She's absolutely fascinated now.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Hm, works for me, keeps this subject fresh, too. And that way I won't need to keep worrying about this little twerp all the time. Perfect!
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Get on the Express, or stay behind...
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: My advice would be to get on. You're not doing me that big of a favor by staying anyway.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: You really are the most self-centered person I've ever met.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: You should meet the others of the Genius Society. Some of them will trick you into thanking them after they milk you dry. At least I have my honesty going for me.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: I'll think about Himeko's offer...
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Yes, give it some good thought.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Just remember to come back often. Make an appointment in advance with Asta or Arlan so I can make time to study you.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: There's no need to rush into this, Herta. Asta's in the master control zone. Let's let  have a talk with Asta first and decide for .
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: , I'll be waiting for you on the platform. It's no hurry if you still have things to do or someone to see.
[Lingering Shadows][Himeko]: Come find me when you've made your decision.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Hey, there you are.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: How did you get here so soon?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: I haven't moved. What you're seeing is one of my remote-controlled puppets. They're all over the station. I just connect to one wherever I am needed.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Sorry if I kept you waiting.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Who's waiting for you? I've been busy. What you're seeing is one of my remote-controlled puppets. They're all over the station. I just connect to one wherever I am needed.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Enough chit-chat,  — I am working on a big project with a few colleagues. If we succeed, it will answer the ultimate question that's been puzzling us for thousands of Amber Eras: The truth about Aeons.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Aeons... think about it. What mystical existences! Some Aeons used to be ordinary humans like you and me, but somehow THEY managed to obtain power beyond our imagination! THEY are mysterious, powerful, silent and terrifying! It's hard to explain all the mysteries surrounding THEM.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: How were THEY created? Why were THEY created? What were THEY created for? , have you ever thought about these questions?
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: All the time.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Great. Curiosity is the foundation of science. Now, we can't just think about it. We should also act. I want to give you the chance to participate in this project. Let's work together.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: What's this got to do with me?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Well indeed, it's got nothing to do with you, but we need you. Give me some time, , I'll make this worthwhile for you too.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: ...42?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: 42 what? Are you even listening to me? We want to solve the mystery behind the Aeons! Right now I want you to participate in this project!
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: The four geniuses of the society wrote a program together. You see the big machine in the office? That machine contains a universe, just like the universe we live in, but it's more streamlined and customized.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: I call it the "Metaverse"!
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Seriously? Don't ride that hype train.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: Let's just keep it simple.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Oh really? That's what my partners said as well. Fine, I am a team player. Then let's call it the "Simulated Universe."
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Now go and experience it for yourself. I will guide you in the Simulated Universe to make sure nothing happens to you! I'll even give you a substantial reward.
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Hey, there you are.
[Lingering Shadows][Narration]: How did you get here so soon?
[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: I haven't moved. What you're seeing is one of my remote-controlled puppets. They're all over the station. I just connect to one wherever I am needed.

[Lingering Shadows][Herta]: Now go and experience it for yourself. I will guide you in the Simulated Universe to make sure nothing happens to you! I'll even give you a substantial reward.

[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Yes, just stand there and the computer will read your brainwaves, then automatically generate an immersive simulated experience...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: , can you see this message? If you do, just  anywhere on the screen —
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Your body is still sitting in the office. This is a Simulated Universe generated from your memories.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: This is only the Alpha test server, where the features are not fully available. Now, try to walk around.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: See? You can move around now. I want you to play Akivili and find some monsters to fight. Let's see which simulated Aeon will notice you first.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: , I pre-loaded those two kids so you don't have to fight alone. How very kind of me, no?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Qlipoth]: There is a murmur in the amber sky. It's dusk. You look up and find countless copper ore, amber and opal falling from the sky. This is a wondrous mineral rain. In the steam, the colossal thing stretched THEIR spine from the mantle with a sledgehammer gripped in THEIR broad palm. You opened your eyes and realized that this is actually Qlipoth, the Aeon of Preservation!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Is this a new trick by Herta?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Is this some kind of role-playing?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Qlipoth]: There is a huge roar around THEM – this is a warning for you. Then, THEY disappear before your eyes.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: "Our calculations are correct. Qlipoth, the Aeon of Preservation, has really appeared." Herta's voice suddenly sounded, and she let out an ambiguous giggle, "The Aeon of Trailblaze, Akivili's revival has attracted an old friend."
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: But THEY have run away.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Tell me more stories about the relationship between the Aeons!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: "What you saw was the simulated Aeon carefully cultivated by Ruan Mei and Screwllum. The simulated Aeons will ignore us just like the real ones, so I set your simulated identity as Akivili, Aeon of Trailblaze, to attract THEM." With a click of her tongue, Herta says, "Now it seems that my judgment is correct. Next time you run into the Aeons, try to get something out of THEM."
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: What do you want to know?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: You must know more about gossip than I do!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: "Myths of the Aeons, anecdotes, love stories, the origin of the universe... Anything will do!" Herta was annoyed, "Just think of something!"
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: I'll cover you for this test. See, I used my clearance to enhance your Blessings.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Now you can go have some fun. Don't ask why. Just thank me. Go, pick one!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Use Preservation Blessings to increase your survivability, look for opportunities to improve your combat strength, and have an audience with the Amber Lord again!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Alas, Qlipoth didn't come. I guessed as much — Pick the Blessing that turns Shields into damage, and hurry onward.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: , I'm going to speed up the process. Now you're going to fight three times in a row. This is not how the Simulated Universe should operate, but I'm running out of patience.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Be sure to collect Preservation Blessings, okay? See if we can get Qlipoth to visit once more.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Come on...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Darn it...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Well, THEY probably won't come.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Sorry, I temporarily revoked your activity permissions — Uh, I need to apologize to you about something.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: I confess, I'm a little too eager for success... I won't interfere with the system again. Just play as you like.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Qlipoth's appearance was probably just a coincidence... That's it. Anyway, I'm sorry.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Simulated Universe]: The fight is over and you wait in place, but nothing happens.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Herta?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Go on.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: What should I do?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: There is a long silence, followed by a deep sigh from Herta. "I was expecting THEM to appear. Never mind. I'll switch off the Simulated Universe then. It'll only take a second and you won't feel a thing. Let's chat back in reality."
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Simulated Universe]: ...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Herta?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Didn't you say it'll only take a second?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: "THEY... came!" You hear Herta's stunned words. "No, not THEM... It's another Aeon! It's..." Her voice suddenly drifts off. You have a strange feeling about this, as if Herta's words solidified and the whole Simulated Universe became somehow unreal.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Fuli]: You see a blurry figure made of mirror fragments, and THEIR facial features are repeatedly refracted by the prism to form a mystery. Countless memories spring up before your eyes.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Fuli]: You see Kafka. Her body is stretched, deformed, and rubbed together with the umbrella in her hand, turning into water droplets and falling at your feet.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Fuli]: You find yourself become a weeping Adlivun baby with an uncut umbilical cord. You remember that there is a golden scar on your body, and golden blood flowing on the dying planet. You find yourself dark-skinned and wearing a robe on the wasteland. You find that you are a swift shadow across the abyss, reaching out to catch the shooting star.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Fuli]: Then, THEIR voice suddenly came... "The robe flutters and wraps around your dark skin, you laugh at exploration. The silk threads spin, overlap, and weave into oceanic words..." Every word THEY say is connected to each other like a whisper. Before you could say anything, THEY suddenly disappear.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Wait, let's talk about Kafka.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: THEY have controlled my brain!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: "We did it!" Herta yells with excitement, "That was Fuli. THEY thought you were the fallen Akivili, so THEY actively started a conversation with you. Fuli is valuable for our research because THEY have the memories of all beings and know almost as much about everything as Nous does! Come on out, , I want to upgrade the Simulated Universe. You need to stay in there even longer in the future!"
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: You said you wouldn't interfere anymore —
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: It feels like a hook pulled at your belly button and your entire body tumbled in a circle. When you open your eyes, you're already back in Herta's office. Your first experience of the Simulated Universe had ended.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Success! I have to tell this news to Stephen right away — , don't just stand there. Go in and see if you can get a few more words out of them or something...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: You should show me some respect.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Oh, you're right. I got too excited... Sorry, . I do respect you! If you don't mind, could you please go in for another test?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: You have no right to order me around.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Oh, you're right. I got too excited... Sorry, . You did very well! If you don't mind, could you please go in for another test?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Alright, I'll go now then.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: I've upgraded the Simulated Universe — it now has more memory and can support longer sessions. The last round must've been pretty boring — I'll get Stephen to add a few more interesting things.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: This part was made specifically with you in mind. Ready to have some fun?
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Yay! I love fun games!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Stephen said the same thing. I don't really get "fun," but whatever. What's more important is that the rewards will also increase!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: Not as good as adding more rewards...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: Oh, but we will — after all, you're gonna be spending more time on this project.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Narration]: I don't trust the definition of "interesting" around here...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: What can I say? I don't trust it either. For some reason, whenever someone tells me they're gonna do something interesting, I end up imagining a pile of trash...
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: ...so I'd rather talk with you about the added rewards part.
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: In a nutshell, this is a long-scheduled version update with longer gameplay, more content, better rewards, and a more bizarre difficulty curve — so get ready and prepare to get back into the Simulated Universe!
[Simulated Universe: First Closed Beta][Herta]: I'll help you out some more. Don't worry.

[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Still haven't made up your mind? Fine. Since I'm interested in you, I'll answer any questions you have.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Herta...
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Me? Hmm, well, Talking about oneself is as pointless as it gets.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You're the master of the space station?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: On paper, yes. But I don't really care about this place. I built it, put some stuff in, left some people here, and let them just manage themselves.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Asta's the lead researcher of the space station, so for all intents and purposes, she's the master. I reject the concept of ownership because I don't want the responsibilities that come with it.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You really are a terrible person.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: It doesn't matter. Who cares if others don't like me? I know I don't care. As long as I have my own value, I can do whatever I want.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: While you may have good character, do you have any value? Don't take that the wrong way, I'm genuinely asking you. You might have some value, I just don't know about it.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What do you actually look like?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Not much different from what you're seeing now. I modeled it after how I looked, back when I was a kid. It might not be identical, but I'd say maybe 70, 80 percent there?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Oh, I was so precocious — all I cared about back then was solving the solitary wave problem, ignoring my precious childhood...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I still have some questions...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Stellarons...
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Stellarons, huh? Ask away, I'm listening.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What exactly is a Stellaron?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: According to my research, it's a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers it to a certain Path or Aeon's power.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Wherever it's located, it responds to that world's desires to advance its civilization. But, this comes at the cost of some form of disaster. The mechanism behind it is likely related to Nanook the Destruction.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Do you know about the Stellaron Hunters?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Oh, that weird bunch. I'm satisfied with just one Stellaron, but they've scoured the universe, obtained several, and still aren't satisfied. I don't know what their true intentions are.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Screwllum went up against the Stellaron Hunters before. I heard there was a member whose hacking skills were on par with Screwllum.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Being on the same level as Screwllum — who's probably the best in the universe — is nothing short of spectacular. It's beyond my abilities, computers are not my forte.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Why am I able to host the Stellaron?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Ha... That I don't know. Which is why I'm gearing up to solve this mystery.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I still have some questions...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Express...
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: The Express? Shouldn't you be asking Himeko instead?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What's the Astral Express like?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: You mean how it looks? Like a train. Well...
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: I was very interested in the Express for a while, and wrote a lot of papers, but forgot where I left them. Now I can't remember anything about it.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Do you trust the Astral Express?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Uh-huh.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What's your relationship with them?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: We've been business partners for a long time.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Every once in a while, I'll need them to get me things from other planets, and they often come to me to help them solve problems.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I still have some questions...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the decision...
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Uh, what decision? You're gonna have to be more specific.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Can I return to the space station?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Of course, I'll still be here waiting for you, eh... and the space station will be waiting for you. Returning... it's not impossible.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: If you wanna be a researcher here, you can just ask Asta. If she's fine with it, I have no complaints.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: No, hold on — you have a Stellaron within you. I think it's better if you left and came back occasionally. It might be dangerous if you stay for too long...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Can I stay at the space station?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: No. You're way too dangerous. I don't mind personally, but I don't want Asta and others to take the risk.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: You wouldn't want the Stellaron in you to hurt all the people in the space station either, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Just come back once in a while. You will always be welcome at the space station — just don't stay for too long.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: ...You really are weird. What's so good about this place? Even I don't like staying here...
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Ugh. Fine. To be honest with you, I have plenty of ways to seal a mere Stellaron — You just might end up not having a lot of personal freedom.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: If you're so keen to stay... Fine. I'm okay with it. Go speak to Asta. She's the lead researcher. She's in charge.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Can I stay at the space station?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: As I've said, talk to Asta! She's the lead researcher. She's in charge. Go, go, go.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: So I should board the Express?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: First of all, you have somewhere to live. And you'd be under their protection. Also, it'll be a long trip, so you'll have more opportunities to find a way to save yourself from the Stellaron. Lastly, if the Stellaron really explodes, you won't harm too many people around you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Do I have any other choice?
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Oh, how should I know! It's up to you, you have so many options to choose from. Maybe jump out a hatch, or hop into the Fragmentum and see if any monsters start worshiping you?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I still have some questions...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Let me think things over.
[The Voyage Continues][Herta]: Okay, suit yourself.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: , thank goodness you're all safe.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: It's a pity that we haven't had the chance to talk much, and now the Express is about to leave. Do you have any questions?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Is the damage to the space station serious?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Madam Herta gave me a piece of code, which she apparently wrote on the way here. I just tried it out and the defense shield's regenerating three times faster than before.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Thanks to her, the Antimatter Legion outside is not much of a threat anymore. The space station's repairs and reconstruction can also begin smoothly, but internally...
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: When the Stellaron was extracted, even for that brief moment, it corroded the space station and formed a new space — what we now call the Fragmentum.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: The part that was corroded is irreversible, so the space station will always be in a state of quasi-Fragmentum.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What are the effects of the Fragmentum?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: All existing Fragmentums are connected, so there will be monsters that will enter the space station through its Fragmentum.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Will I also be corroded by the Fragmentum?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Ahh, I'd like to know the answer to that as well.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: All existing Fragmentums are connected, so monsters will be able to enter the space station through the Fragmentum here. But it shouldn't allow anything to exit your body, so...
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: I talked with Arlan and there's no easy solution to this problem at the moment. We can only increase the security and patrol frequency to protect the ongoing research.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Make sure you don't burn yourself out.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: After all this is over, I'm putting my vacation time in with Madam Herta. I've got it all planned. I'll hop on an airship and give The Blue a good look.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You can see it from the space station, you know?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Be that as it may, taking it in while on vacation and observing it during work are not the same thing.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Will Madam Herta let you take a vacation?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: I guess so? I haven't taken leave once since I joined the space station...
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: And if I have an actual, full vacation, I can take my time to collect observational data and finish writing my paper.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Of course, there's already a lot of published research on The Blue, but I want to study it myself. It might sound a lot like work, but it's really just a hobby — there are no deadlines or quotas to meet, and I don't get paid.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Can I stay at the space station?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: I like you, but... you have a Stellaron in your body.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: If you were just wandering around, or if you agreed to be sealed away in an experiment pod, that would be fine.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: But if you're going to work in the space station long-term, the Stellaron may have some serious effects on the station's Fragmentum. As the lead researcher, that's a risk I cannot take.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: I can sense your enthusiasm for the space station, but I'm afraid I have to turn you away.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Herta says I can stay.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Huh? Madam Herta said that?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: In that case... I have nothing against it either. Mind you, if Madam Herta was to do something to you, ...
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: She's not going to care a lot about what you think.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Is there really no way I can help?
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: If you wanted to come back and help, of course, I wouldn't refuse you. Dan Heng helped inventory our rare items, March 7th said that she would help out as much as she can and connected over 50 wires in the electrical room. Everyone from the Express is so obliging...
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: And I think you're pretty good at "meddling" too, .
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Let me think things over.
[The Voyage Continues][Asta]: Sure, no hurry.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Oh, it's you, ... Do you have something on your mind?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You're really good at taking care of others.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Oh? What did I do?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You're always the first one to charge into battle.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Is that so? Well, I am the train's guard. I suppose it's just instinct.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Your judgments are always accurate.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: It's about being observant at all times and carefully making the best choice for the situation. You can do it too.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I think you're not bad yourself, .
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I didn't think you approved of me.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: If you're referring to what I think about you joining the Astral Express... You're overthinking it.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: My position is simple: It doesn't matter to me. I suggest you ignore my opinions and make your own choice.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You don't seem like someone who likes to travel.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Being on the Express isn't exactly the same as "traveling" or "adventuring..." The Astral Express symbolizes "trailblazing" you understand?
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Trailblazing implies the unknown, be it unknown risks or unknown rewards.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: In my opinion, the unknown is no more terrifying than the known... In fact, the unknown signifies something we can control and change.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I'm a little hesitant.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Don't use hesitation as an excuse. If you hesitate for too long, your original way of thinking will eventually cease to exist.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I understand.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Mm, okay then.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Hey, ! I heard the news. You're coming with us on the Express, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I haven't decided yet!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Oh come on, you know that's what you want deep down inside. I can see it on your face.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Do you want me to come along?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Do I even need to say it? I think we're becoming fast friends... isn't that enough?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: But you look like you've got something on your mind... come on, out with it!
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Oh how time flies.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Getting nostalgic already?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Y'know, when you were passed out, all I thought was I had to look after you. And then you picked up the bat! Just incredible!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: In the blink of an eye, you knocked that big fella into Mr. Yang's black hole and saved me... I still haven't thanked you properly yet...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Nah, we're not splitting up here...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: How did you join the Express?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: I'd like to know too, because I was already on the Express when I woke up.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: I was just drifting out there in space and got picked up by the Express. Amazing, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Does that kind of thing happen often?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Crazy stuff like that? Not too often. It sure freaked me out.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: But every encounter I've had since coming aboard the Express has been strange to say the least.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: For example, going to the desert to catch something called a "sandfish," correcting a gravitational field to flip an upside-down castle, or almost getting my head cracked open by a galena ball falling from the sky while trying to avoid a sleeping reindeer on the road—
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Huh... looking back now, it all seems quite dangerous... But I had the crew there with me, so the problems didn't seem all that bad.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I'm thinking about if I should get on the Express...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Of course you should! Why wouldn't you?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: There's only four of us now, plus Pom-Pom. Each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! You wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: That sounds more like a problem for you guys.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Join us, . Then it wouldn't be a problem anymore.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I don't know what the carriage is like.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Then come aboard and take a look for yourself.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Let me think things over.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: I'll be waiting for you, .
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: So, have you thought things through?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I want to join the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Then come with me.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I've made up my mind. I'll stay.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Stay? But Herta...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Herta and Asta both gave me the green light.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Is that so... Well, I respect your choice.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Take care, . We'll come back now and then to see you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: So long, Himeko.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I need some more time to think...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I need some more time to think...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I still have something to talk to you about, Himeko.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Hm? Go ahead, speak your mind.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Thank you.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: There's no need to be so formal. You helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. Plus, If we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: You've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the Antimatter Legion. And know that while Herta may not admit it, she owes me one. And she will not refuse me if I ask for a favor in return...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: And it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: How about we continue talking on the Express? I'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Have you taken care of everything you need?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Haha, I was ready ages ago. *sigh* I've been here so many times before, it should've been just an ordinary trip for me.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: But everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. That's the meaning of trailblazing.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What's the next stop for the Express?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: As always, to follow in the footsteps of Akivili.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. There are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I love the vast reaches of space, and the Express does too. I want to seek out new worlds, and the Express wants to return to its former path.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Why invite me to join?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Because you're different.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Because of the Stellaron?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: While that might be the biggest reason, it's not the only one.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I'm very self-aware.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Well, the fact that you have a Stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I think you need a chance. A chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. Everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a Stellaron inside you...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: But that's already plain as day to you. And no matter who tells you — be it me, or Herta, or anybody — it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: You have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the Stellaron, and to know who you really are... Learn to control the Stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is — it's a part of you. And you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I need some time to think...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Let's go~
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Time to get on.
[The Voyage Continues][???]: Ahem!
[The Voyage Continues][???]: I'm over here.
[The Voyage Continues][???]: Hey, you over there looking dumbfounded. Yes, Pom-Pom's talking to you.
[The Voyage Continues][???]: Himeko told Pom-Pom about your situation. Now listen up, Pom-Pom will only say this once.
[The Voyage Continues][???]: Pom-Pom's sure there have been lots of people telling you how special you are lately, but this is the Astral Express, and everyone on here has their secrets.
[The Voyage Continues][???]: Since you chose to board, you can abide by the rules. You're not the only special one here. You'd best remember that.
[The Voyage Continues][???]: I'm Pom-Pom, the conductor. Just come find me if you have any trouble.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Oh, it's you. How do you feel?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Full of energy.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Great. Looks like your stamina is really quite special.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I've got a killer headache.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: ...I'll check you out in a minute.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Very tasteful.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Tasteful... Oh, you mean the train? I was asking how you felt physically.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: You are right, though. Looking at the interior decoration, you can tell that trailblazers have quite good taste.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: In any case, I have to thank you for saving March.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You guys saved me, too.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Heh, all I did was calm that thing inside you down temporarily...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: ...I don't want to frighten you, but the truth is you won't ever be in the clear while it is still inside your body.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I couldn't just stand by and watch.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: It's good that you think so. Someone with that mindset and the actions to back it up — that is the true meaning of the word "hero."
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I didn't think too much about it...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Helping others without a second thought — that is the most important quality of a hero.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: However, as long as the Stellaron is still in your body, you should be careful what you do. I don't know if Himeko and I can suppress it again.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: But I won't bore you any longer. So much happened at the space station, you must be tired.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: There should be some time until the next warp jump, so feel free to walk around and familiarize yourself with the environment.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: But I won't bore you any longer. So much happened at the space station, you must be tired.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: There should be some time until the next warp jump, so feel free to walk around and familiarize yourself with the environment.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: What do you think? Does the Astral Express look the same as you imagined?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: As I expected, it looks like a train.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Everyone on the Express is a passenger.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: We're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Maybe that's why the Trailblaze chose such a look.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I feel like it's missing something...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: March said something like that at first, too.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Seems like you young people have similar tastes.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Oh right — March and Dan Heng should both be in their rooms right now.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: You can go look for them. You youngsters should get along well.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Are their rooms fun?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Ah, you know, young people! Their rooms always reflect their personality.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: You can go and... have a look around?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What about here...?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: We usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Also, don't mind Pom-Pom's antics. They're actually pretty interested in you. It's just that we haven't had new passengers on the Express for a long while.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I won't steal Pom-Pom's thunder. If you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Also, don't mind Pom-Pom's antics. They're actually pretty interested in you. It's just that we haven't had new passengers on the Express for a long while.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I won't steal Pom-Pom's thunder. If you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Here already? I was just engaging in pleasantries. How can I help?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Where's March 7th's room?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Oh? Why are you interested in her room?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ah, Pom-Pom remembers Himeko saying that you saved her...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Mmm, very brave! Very foolhardy! But that is what a Trailblazer should be like.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: March 7th's room is in the Express Sleeper Compartment. She's always running around, so she might not be there.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Dan Heng's room...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Dan Heng's room? Oh, you mean the archives.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: He's just... sort of living in there, I guess. I can't be bothered getting him out.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: March 7th's room is right next to the Archives. You can visit him on the way.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Is that a... phonograph?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Investigate the phonograph])
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You recognize this as well?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Himeko always likes to bring back weird junk and try to fix it.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: That also got modified a bit.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: That's all my questions for today.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom still needs to prepare for the Express' warp jump. You can look around the place yourself.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: No matter where you go on this train, Pom-Pom will always have my eyes on you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Hey! Y—You don't have any questions to ask Pom-Pom!?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Is it because you think Pom-Pom talks too much? Or is it Pom-Pom's age? You youngsters gotta learn to bridge that generation gap.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Himeko likes using the Phonograph a lot. She says it can play melodies from the past.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Welt likes collecting these jet-black discs. It seems like they could be antiques. He'd be very happy if you could bring a few back.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: (Opens
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You just left. Why are you back again!?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Go, go. I'm busy here and I don't have time for you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Hm? Who's there?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: It's me, .
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: ...Oh, it's you. The door's not locked. Come in.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I haven't even knocked...
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I learned to sense incoming visitors after people kept barging in so frequently.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Can I help you?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Just looking around.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Feel free. This is open to everyone on the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: While many of the roads that Akivili traveled along no longer exist, I think it's still meaningful to record our adventures as current passengers of the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I enter the collected data into the archives' data bank. I try to catalog the people and places the Express encounters, and compare and contrast them with the existing records.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Do you see the terminal over there? It can be used to view information already stored in the data bank. Do give it a go.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I'll be entering any new information we encounter on future journeys, so drop by anytime to check it out. We also have a shortcut on the terminal device.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I didn't take you to be a scholar.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Seems like you have some deep misunderstandings about me. *sigh* Ah, well, I think I know who caused that.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I didn't know you could fix computers so well.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Y'know, I'm not... *sigh*
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I have matters to attend to, feel free.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: So, if you're headed next door...
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: ...keep it down.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: There is only one thin quilt, but it looks very warm. Being surrounded by all the books and records provides a surprising sense of security.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: A hard bed is good for your spine. A bed that's too soft will end up hurting you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Just a little peek?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Never mind.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: : Make a choice I won't regret... reach the future...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: :
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Step DescriptionYou boarded the amazing Astral Express. From now on, this will be your home. A new adventure is about to start. Prepare to warp jump to a new world!
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem, hi, hello~ Attention all passengers. Attention all passengers.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express is about to conduct a warp jump. All passengers, please gather at the main hall.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: I repeat. The Express is about to conduct a warp jump. All passengers, please gather at the main hall.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: There you are!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Wait, this is your first trip! So that should be double the excitement, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I'm ready, I'm ready to go!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: That's the spirit!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Hehe, I was excited the first time I experienced a warp jump, too. But I'm used to it now.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: But... I'm still a little worried about what lies ahead.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ah! You're just like Mr. Yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Young people should be energetic! Here, let's do some relaxation exercises.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: The first step is to grab a hold of the root cause of your anxiety.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You can't just grab something like that!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: OK, I got it.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: You really got it, huh!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: The second step is to focus all your anxiety on that point.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Is this some sort of mumbo jumbo about transferring consciousness?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: This is science! Don't get distracted! *deep breath* Focus.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Okay, I'm ready for step three.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Seems like you're a natural. It's not easy to reach this level of enlightenment.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Now for step three: Yank out that anxiety and cast it away with all your might!
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Come on, that's just using psychological suggestion!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: That doesn't mean it won't work! The best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Okay, well I've cast out all the anxiety now.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Really? I've never been able to do it successfully myself!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: What does it feel like? Like all your worries have been swept away?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: What's wrong? You look like you were about to say something.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Oh, I think I know what you were going to ask. You've come to the right person.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Express...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Ohh, you want to know more about the Express? I'm glad. After all, it's an important companion of ours.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the history of the Express...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Astral Express was a tool created by Akivili the Trailblaze, who used it to transport THEMSELF and the Nameless across the galaxy. It is rumored that there are other vehicles like it, but the Express has no such records.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: When I found the Express, its memory had been severely damaged, with much of its valuable information lost. All I know is that the Express is an Aspect of Creation built by Akivili themself, and used to travel the cosmos.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: As for how it was built and how it was damaged, I do not have an answer.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About where the Express is headed...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Express is traveling on a route that the Trailblazer once embarked on. The names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at Pegana — Akivili's home world.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: We speculate the Astral Express started its journey from Pegana, stopping at each destination along the way before returning there for its next journey. However, the appearance of the Stellarons has caused a delay at each stop.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Express' source of power...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: There is a legend in the galaxy: The heart of Akivili themself lies in the core of the Astral Express, providing it with the power to travel between worlds. But I found no evidence of that aboard the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Besides, the Express existed before the Trailblaze fell. There's no way they could have had two hearts, right? However, it is likely that the Express possesses some sort of mechanism to transfer power from the Trailblaze.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: It wouldn't be possible with a normal Pathstrider.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Akivili...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The fallen Aeon, deceased Trailblaze — THEIR passing is still a mystery, but of all the known Aeons, Akivili was the closest to mankind.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: In the databank aboard the Express, it is recorded that THEY walked among the mortals — adventuring, fighting, and celebrating with THEM. Although THEY were an Aeon restrained by the "Primum Mobile," Akivili enjoyed a freedom similar to us mortals.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: THEY were different from most... But THEIR passing came so suddenly that it was thought THEY were killed by another Aeon. I don't believe that to be the case.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the galaxy...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The galaxy is endlessly vast. I wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About its nature...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I've been to many different worlds, yet I still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. As for its nature, there are a few theories that I can share with you.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The most popular is probably the Cosmos Tree theory, proposed by Zandar, Emanator of Erudition and the first member of the Genius Society. He compared the galaxy to an enormous imaginary tree, with its leaves being individual universes.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Therefore, only Aeons, who draw their energy from the imaginary, and Emanators, who are blessed by Aeons, can travel through the spaces filled with imaginary energy. That's why planets where civilizations exist are so similar.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: However, the theory has its flaws. Elias Salas, the 56th member of the Genius Society, invented remote detection, disproving that the imaginary is unique. This shook the foundation of the "Cosmos Tree" theory.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: There are other theories as well: The "Stretching" theory, the "Heat Torch" theory, and the "Parallel Imaging" theory... The Riddlers claim the galaxy is just a dream and IX's followers seem to like that claim.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Aeons...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Aeons are the most mysterious beings in the galaxy. All we know is that THEY ascended from the form of intelligent beings. As for the how and why, even the geniuses over at the Genius Society haven't the slightest clue.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Upon ascending to Aeon-hood, that being gains power over the Paths, free to choose the allocation of imaginary energy however THEY wish, while suffering the restrictions of the "Primum Mobile."
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Aeon of Destruction seeks only to destroy the universe, while the Aeon of Erudition wants to find the answer for all that exists. Meanwhile, the Aeon of Preservation continues to forge walls, and the Aeon of Enigmata devotes themself to obscuring all that is known...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: A cloud of mystery shrouds the Aeons. I heard Madam Herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about THEM.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the factions...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Compared to the Aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. Mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of Aeons and the Paths.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Many Aeons are unreachable, but the factions are close to us. After Akivili trailblazed across the galaxy, people became aware of the existence of other worlds. Gradually, more people started trying to use the power of the Aeons to travel between worlds.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Interastral Peace Corporation is a good example: They worship Qlipoth, the Aeon of Preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Another example is the Genius Society: There is no shortage of eccentrics like Madam Herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the Erudition.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: These factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. It would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Paths...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The birth of an Aeon gives rise to a Path. The nature of the Paths remains a mystery, leaving us to draw an analogy in a way that mortals can understand: It's a philosophical concept of sorts.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: A person is considered to be on a Path when their will overlaps with that Path. If the person has a strong enough will, they can draw power from that Path. Those who can do so are called Pathstriders.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Pathstriders possess extraordinary power, but are still insignificant compared to the Aeons, like a drop of water in a vast ocean. Sometimes, Aeons will bestow a mortal with their power, making them an "Emanator" of that Aeon.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I should mention that once a Path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its Aeon. That is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite Akivili's passing.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Trailblaze...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: "Trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the Express to travel across the galaxy.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Exploration...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Understanding...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Establishing...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Establish a connection with the new world — rejoice with it and share in its fears.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Connection...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: This is your first time experiencing the warp jump, so a little discomfort is unavoidable.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: If you're really anxious about it, I can stay here and have a chat with you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About our companions...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: About everyone on the Express? Who would you like to know about?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Himeko...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Haha, she's the owner of the Express. We joke around calling Pom-Pom the conductor, but everyone knows Himeko is the boss.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: It all started with her encounter with the Astral Express, and they haven't been apart since then.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: She's... extremely passionate, like a burning sun. However, she remains mysterious most of the time. Once in a while, you feel that she's burning herself out trying to accomplish her dream.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Only someone like her is worthy of the Astral Express. I think Himeko's vision of her whole life revolves around... a very important dream.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Pom-Pom...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: To be honest, I don't know when Pom-Pom appeared... I think it was before I came to the Express? No wait, maybe it was after...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Pom-Pom is like the spirit of the Astral Express. Whenever anyone on the Express needs help, they will appear immediately. It would be ill-advised to underestimate them.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Pom-Pom is terrifying when they get angry... Yes, terrifying...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Dan Heng...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Dan Heng is a lonely child. He may appear distant and cold, but his heart is kind. Perhaps, he's the way he is today because he spent so much time on the run. Sometimes, he reminds me of myself when I was young...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: We don't know what he's running from. He once told me that he didn't know either. All he knew was that something was chasing him and that he had to run away — first from the Xianzhou, then the IPC.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: So he boarded the ship of a troupe called the "Mourning Actors" and escaped the IPC. After a while he made his way to the Express, and he's stayed here longer than anywhere else.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Don't worry, no matter who or what wants to hurt Dan Heng, we won't let them. Those who dare attack members of the Astral Express should be prepared to suffer the wrath of me and Himeko.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About March 7th...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Did Himeko tell you about March 7th? She was trapped in ice, floating through space. We happened upon her and rescued her.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: It was a unique type of ice known as Six-Phased Ice — a substance that adheres to Imaginary Law, meaning that external forces cannot change its form.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Whoever sealed her inside the Six-Phased Ice... No matter who it is... did so either to protect or banish her. I believe she had been floating through space for some time.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Stellarons...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: It's impossible to trace the origin of this phenomenon. When it's observed by humans — or I should say once it begins to affect the physical world — it's already too late to reverse.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: It's like a sudden storm that appears on a calm ocean. This phenomenon causes the smooth journey through the expanse to be filled with dangers.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: The mechanism whereby this mutation and corrosion spreads is the Stellarons.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: It promulgated rapidly like cancer cells, so the Interastral Peace Corporation named it the Cancer of All Worlds.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Antimatter Legion...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: They are an army ruled by the Aeon of Destruction, Nanook.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: As Nanook's followers, they stand against all life and civilization and execute the will of Destruction, disseminating chaos and calamity.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: Their actions cannot be explained by reason, because their only motivation and purpose is to destroy.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Fragmentum...
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: The Fragmentums are a phenomenon of corrosion.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: The mainstream school of thought is that Stellarons catalyzed the appearance of Fragmentums.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: All matter and space that comes into contact with the Fragmentum will be turned into Fragmentum creations.
[The Voyage Continues][Welt]: However, you don't have to feel too burdened. At the very least, the current state of the Stellaron in your body is very stable and will not cause distortion to the outside.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I don't have any other questions.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You took long enough! But at least everyone's here now.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Where is Dan Heng?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: He won't be here, so just leave him be.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Oh yeah, take these.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: What's this?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Just a little gift from the conductor to the passenger. Think of it as an investment in your future growth.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Okay everyone, hurry up and find a place to sit down. Try not to be like March, always running around the Express like a headless chicken.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom's going to start the final preparations for the jump.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: : The universe...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: : The Astral Express...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: : Aeons...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: : ...Did I get dragged into a science fiction movie or something?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: : This "Stellaron" thing... in my body...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Are you trying to catch the stars?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Hee-hee, I've done stuff like that before.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: But, it wasn't stars for me though... it was lights.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: When I first woke up after being rescued from the ice, I could see clusters of stars in front of me. I reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: The whole crew was watching me — it was pretty embarrassing...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Rescued from the ice?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Oh, I forgot to tell you.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Before all this, I was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: The whole crew was watching you?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Uh-huh! Like I was some kind of weird alien! I don't really blame them for being curious though — they had no idea where I came from.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: You might not believe it, but before all this, I was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Himeko and Mr. Yang and... who was it again? Anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: How did you get frozen?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Who knows? I don't remember anything before that.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Do you remember what happened before you were frozen?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: I don't remember a thing.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Who I am, where I'm from, my name... it's like everything was erased from my mind. "March 7th" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ever since then, I've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. I'm hoping that one day, I can find my past...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ugh, what am I talking about this for? Way to get everyone down, huh.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Sorry.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: It's fine. I was the one who brought it up.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: ...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Cheer up, ! It's not every day someone gets to ride on the Astral Express...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ah, here comes the conductor!
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express has reached a safe distance from the space station. We'll be jumping in about ten minutes.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Return to your seats please, both of you. Things could get bumpy!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Uh... thanks, Pom-Pom. But did you really have to come and remind me? I'm not a newbie, you know~
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Well, it wouldn't be necessary, but Miss March 7th likes to challenge herself... and falls over every time.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: That's just called never giving up! Hehe~

[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Can I help you?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Just looking around.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Feel free. This is open to everyone on the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: While many of the roads that Akivili traveled along no longer exist, I think it's still meaningful to record our adventures as current passengers of the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I enter the collected data into the archives' data bank. I try to catalog the people and places the Express encounters, and compare and contrast them with the existing records.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Do you see the terminal over there? It can be used to view information already stored in the data bank. Do give it a go.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I'll be entering any new information we encounter on future journeys, so drop by anytime to check it out. We also have a shortcut on the terminal device.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I didn't take you to be a scholar.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Seems like you have some deep misunderstandings about me. *sigh* Ah, well, I think I know who caused that.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I didn't know you could fix computers so well.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: Y'know, I'm not... *sigh*
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: I have matters to attend to, feel free.
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: So, if you're headed next door...
[The Voyage Continues][Dan Heng]: ...keep it down.

[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem, hi, hello~ Attention all passengers. Attention all passengers.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express is about to conduct a warp jump. All passengers, please gather at the main hall.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: I repeat. The Express is about to conduct a warp jump. All passengers, please gather at the main hall.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: There you are!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Wait, this is your first trip! So that should be double the excitement, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I'm ready, I'm ready to go!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: That's the spirit!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Hehe, I was excited the first time I experienced a warp jump, too. But I'm used to it now.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: But... I'm still a little worried about what lies ahead.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ah! You're just like Mr. Yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Young people should be energetic! Here, let's do some relaxation exercises.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: The first step is to grab a hold of the root cause of your anxiety.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: You can't just grab something like that!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: OK, I got it.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: You really got it, huh!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: The second step is to focus all your anxiety on that point.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Is this some sort of mumbo jumbo about transferring consciousness?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: This is science! Don't get distracted! *deep breath* Focus.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Okay, I'm ready for step three.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Seems like you're a natural. It's not easy to reach this level of enlightenment.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Now for step three: Yank out that anxiety and cast it away with all your might!
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Come on, that's just using psychological suggestion!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: That doesn't mean it won't work! The best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Okay, well I've cast out all the anxiety now.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Really? I've never been able to do it successfully myself!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: What does it feel like? Like all your worries have been swept away?
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: What's wrong? You look like you were about to say something.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Oh, I think I know what you were going to ask. You've come to the right person.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Express...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Ohh, you want to know more about the Express? I'm glad. After all, it's an important companion of ours.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the history of the Express...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Astral Express was a tool created by Akivili the Trailblaze, who used it to transport THEMSELF and the Nameless across the galaxy. It is rumored that there are other vehicles like it, but the Express has no such records.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: When I found the Express, its memory had been severely damaged, with much of its valuable information lost. All I know is that the Express is an Aspect of Creation built by Akivili themself, and used to travel the cosmos.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: As for how it was built and how it was damaged, I do not have an answer.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About where the Express is headed...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Express is traveling on a route that the Trailblazer once embarked on. The names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at Pegana — Akivili's home world.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: We speculate the Astral Express started its journey from Pegana, stopping at each destination along the way before returning there for its next journey. However, the appearance of the Stellarons has caused a delay at each stop.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Express' source of power...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: There is a legend in the galaxy: The heart of Akivili themself lies in the core of the Astral Express, providing it with the power to travel between worlds. But I found no evidence of that aboard the Express.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Besides, the Express existed before the Trailblaze fell. There's no way they could have had two hearts, right? However, it is likely that the Express possesses some sort of mechanism to transfer power from the Trailblaze.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: It wouldn't be possible with a normal Pathstrider.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Akivili...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The fallen Aeon, deceased Trailblaze — THEIR passing is still a mystery, but of all the known Aeons, Akivili was the closest to mankind.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: In the databank aboard the Express, it is recorded that THEY walked among the mortals — adventuring, fighting, and celebrating with THEM. Although THEY were an Aeon restrained by the "Primum Mobile," Akivili enjoyed a freedom similar to us mortals.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: THEY were different from most... But THEIR passing came so suddenly that it was thought THEY were killed by another Aeon. I don't believe that to be the case.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the galaxy...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The galaxy is endlessly vast. I wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About its nature...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I've been to many different worlds, yet I still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. As for its nature, there are a few theories that I can share with you.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The most popular is probably the Cosmos Tree theory, proposed by Zandar, Emanator of Erudition and the first member of the Genius Society. He compared the galaxy to an enormous imaginary tree, with its leaves being individual universes.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Therefore, only Aeons, who draw their energy from the imaginary, and Emanators, who are blessed by Aeons, can travel through the spaces filled with imaginary energy. That's why planets where civilizations exist are so similar.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: However, the theory has its flaws. Elias Salas, the 56th member of the Genius Society, invented remote detection, disproving that the imaginary is unique. This shook the foundation of the "Cosmos Tree" theory.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: There are other theories as well: The "Stretching" theory, the "Heat Torch" theory, and the "Parallel Imaging" theory... The Riddlers claim the galaxy is just a dream and IX's followers seem to like that claim.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Aeons...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Aeons are the most mysterious beings in the galaxy. All we know is that THEY ascended from the form of intelligent beings. As for the how and why, even the geniuses over at the Genius Society haven't the slightest clue.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Upon ascending to Aeon-hood, that being gains power over the Paths, free to choose the allocation of imaginary energy however THEY wish, while suffering the restrictions of the "Primum Mobile."
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Aeon of Destruction seeks only to destroy the universe, while the Aeon of Erudition wants to find the answer for all that exists. Meanwhile, the Aeon of Preservation continues to forge walls, and the Aeon of Enigmata devotes themself to obscuring all that is known...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: A cloud of mystery shrouds the Aeons. I heard Madam Herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about THEM.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the factions...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Compared to the Aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. Mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of Aeons and the Paths.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Many Aeons are unreachable, but the factions are close to us. After Akivili trailblazed across the galaxy, people became aware of the existence of other worlds. Gradually, more people started trying to use the power of the Aeons to travel between worlds.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The Interastral Peace Corporation is a good example: They worship Qlipoth, the Aeon of Preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Another example is the Genius Society: There is no shortage of eccentrics like Madam Herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the Erudition.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: These factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. It would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About the Paths...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: The birth of an Aeon gives rise to a Path. The nature of the Paths remains a mystery, leaving us to draw an analogy in a way that mortals can understand: It's a philosophical concept of sorts.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: A person is considered to be on a Path when their will overlaps with that Path. If the person has a strong enough will, they can draw power from that Path. Those who can do so are called Pathstriders.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Pathstriders possess extraordinary power, but are still insignificant compared to the Aeons, like a drop of water in a vast ocean. Sometimes, Aeons will bestow a mortal with their power, making them an "Emanator" of that Aeon.
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: I should mention that once a Path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its Aeon. That is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite Akivili's passing.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Trailblaze...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: "Trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the Express to travel across the galaxy.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Exploration...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Understanding...

[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Establishing...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Establish a connection with the new world — rejoice with it and share in its fears.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: About Connection...
[The Voyage Continues][Himeko]: Connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: I have another question...

[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Before all this, I was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: The whole crew was watching you?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Uh-huh! Like I was some kind of weird alien! I don't really blame them for being curious though — they had no idea where I came from.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: You might not believe it, but before all this, I was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Himeko and Mr. Yang and... who was it again? Anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: How did you get frozen?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Who knows? I don't remember anything before that.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Do you remember what happened before you were frozen?
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: I don't remember a thing.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Who I am, where I'm from, my name... it's like everything was erased from my mind. "March 7th" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ever since then, I've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. I'm hoping that one day, I can find my past...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ugh, what am I talking about this for? Way to get everyone down, huh.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Sorry.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: It's fine. I was the one who brought it up.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: ...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Cheer up, ! It's not every day someone gets to ride on the Astral Express...
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Ah, here comes the conductor!
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express has reached a safe distance from the space station. We'll be jumping in about ten minutes.
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Return to your seats please, both of you. Things could get bumpy!
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: Uh... thanks, Pom-Pom. But did you really have to come and remind me? I'm not a newbie, you know~
[The Voyage Continues][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Well, it wouldn't be necessary, but Miss March 7th likes to challenge herself... and falls over every time.
[The Voyage Continues][March 7th]: That's just called never giving up! Hehe~

[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Conductor, can I get a juice, please? Thank youuuu~
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ugh... We're jumping in five minutes! You can have something to drink when it's over!
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: ...But I'm thirsty now!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Our next stop is a small planet called Jarilo-VI.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: It's been thousands of years since the last time the Express paid a visit. The data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: But after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: Jumps are like this: They may feel novel the first few times, but you'll slowly get used to them after a few more.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: As for the mechanism... Well, if you're interested, I'll explain it to you in detail when we have more time.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: For now, just sit and wait. Remember to close your eyes — it helps with the dizziness.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: The door is shut tight...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: :
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Oh, don't worry about me. I just wanna see if I can stay on my feet this time~
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Good luck, I'm rooting for you.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Thanks. I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: The key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. It's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Don't hurt yourself.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: It's fine, I'm sturdier than I look~ Besides, the ice will protect me.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: When I'm in danger, I instinctively create ice to protect myself.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: ...Though sometimes falling on the ice actually hurts more than falling on the ground.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Why do you make things hard for yourself?
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Don't be silly — this is fun!
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: I like keeping busy, otherwise I start obsessing over... pointless things.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Well, don't mind me. Find a place to sit down and buckle up.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Hello? Hello hello?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: All passengers, please return to your seats.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: ...I won't fall over! I won't fall over!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The train is about to make the jump!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Hold on, everyone!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 5
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 4
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 3
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 2
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 1
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: After all those millennia... is this what Jarilo-VI has become?
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Huh? So that snowy planet is our destination this time?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Yes... Looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Spatial readout anomaly! Star rail stability is down to 12%!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Schedule alteration: Seven-day stopover time extended indefinitely!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Anomaly?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: The complex locality of this world has been... affected somehow. The star rail has been blocked off by something.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Take an ordinary train as an example: It's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: The only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Indefinitely?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Indefinitely. Until the anomaly is removed!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Take an ordinary train as an example: It's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: The only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Pom-Pom: If we try to force our way ahead, there could be a hefty price to pay!
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: This again... Don't tell me, it's gotta be...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: The results of the preliminary analysis are here — the anomaly stems from a Stellaron, as always.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Stellaron...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: Yes,  — just like the one that's been placed into your body.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: What should we do...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Don't worry. It's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a Stellaron.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Stellarons are clouded in mystery — even Herta isn't able to fully understand them... but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: What exactly is a Stellaron?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Stellarons are clouded in mystery — even Herta isn't able to fully understand them...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: But there's no need to worry — this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a Stellaron. Even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: The only thing we can say for sure is that their arrival causes massive changes to civilizations and ecosystems. They also generate distortions in space such as Fragmentums.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: There must be an inextricable connection between the Stellaron we're dealing with here, and Jarilo-VI becoming a frozen planet.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Our current theory is that Stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain Aeon throughout the universe. We can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: So you're saying...
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: That we've gotta get busy!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Why can't the people in the worlds affected save themselves?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: It's empowering, looking out at a world from a window like this...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: ...but when you set foot on the planet itself, you realize how small and helpless you really are — just like them.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: So we're like a chivalrous band of cosmic knights!
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Right! You finally get what we're all about. Pretty cool, huh?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: , I'd like to entrust this trailblazing expedition to March, Dan Heng, and you.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: The objective is clear: Find the Stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the Express. We'll deal with the rest.
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Awesome! We get to work as a team again, !
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: You're not coming?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Someone has to stay on the train, or Pom-Pom will get lonely.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Not to mention, Nanook threw us a glance just now. If we're targeted by the Antimatter Legion, then things could go south fast.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: Why us?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: Because you three made a great team back in the space station. My guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Narration]: I'm kinda sleepy...
[Drifting Between the Stars][March 7th]: Hey! That's not the spirit!
[Drifting Between the Stars][Welt]: So it's still not our turn...
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: I know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. It'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: , March, if you two are ready, why not go and find Dan Heng?
[Drifting Between the Stars][Himeko]: He's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for Jarilo-VI. It's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.

[A Grand Cool Adventure][Himeko]: Thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. Now the Express is relying on you to get it moving again.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Himeko]: Remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: Explore, understand, establish, and connect.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Himeko]: And I'm sure you'll get along really well with March and Dan Heng.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Welt]: Ever since the Destruction sowed Stellarons across the universe, many worlds have changed.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Welt]: Nanook the Destruction, Yaoshi the Abundance, Terminus the Finality... I've seen and learned a lot in my time, but I still struggle to understand some of the Aeons' actions.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Each stop brings its own grand and exciting adventure!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Have you been on an adventure before, Pom-Pom?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Pom-Pom: No...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Have you been to Jarilo-VI before, Pom-Pom?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Pom-Pom: No.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom can't leave the train right now...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: : Pom-Pom's so dejected all of a sudden...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: How's my Trailblaze Level?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: I'm heading out.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: A planet covered in snow and ice... Will I find my answer here...?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: WHOA! Don't sneak up on me like that!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Why are you still here? Go find Dan Heng! Exciting adventures are waiting for us.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Are you doing okay after your first jump?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Dizziness or retching are normal reactions. You'll feel better once you get used to it.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: I feel fine.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: So you have high compatibility with the Express. That's good.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Why aren't you with everyone else?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: I enjoy being alone, especially when I have important work to do.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: I went through the Express' database, and it seems the environment on Jarilo-VI has undergone drastic changes in the past few centuries. It was not a frozen planet to begin with...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Welt says it was caused by a Stellaron.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: He said so? Hmm... considering the spatial obstacles that the star rail has encountered, it's highly possible.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: I've conducted a preliminary survey and found that there's one area with a relatively normal temperature on the surface of the planet. By "normal," I mean a temperature that just about allows for human survival.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: If I had to choose a site for initial investigation on this trailblazing expedition, that would be it.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Himeko wants you, me, and March 7th to go together.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: ...As I expected. Before you came, whenever March wanted to go anywhere, Himeko would make Mr. Yang and me go with her.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: And even after you arrived, I didn't suppose I'd be the one to be liberated of that duty.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Can't you and March 7th go?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: If I know Himeko, she's not gonna let you stay behind.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: You're new, I'm sure she wants to get you started with some firsthand trailblazing.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Don't worry. With March around, you are guaranteed an eventful expedition.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: I assume the trailblazing objective this time is to find the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI and dispel the effect it's exerting on the star rail... right?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: I see. , you should find March. I'll join you two once I'm ready.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: I see. , you should find March. I'll join you two once I'm ready.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Did you talk to Dan Heng? How'd it go?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Full of enthusiasm.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Really? I find that hard to believe...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: He doesn't seem very enthusiastic...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: *sigh* That's our Dan Heng — always trying to look cool with his poker face. Don't mind him~
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Relax, ! Dan Heng and I are experienced trailblazers! We got your back!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Well, are you ready?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: You bet!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: I need a minute...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: When I first saw this planet, I thought: A world covered in ice... could it have something to do with my past? Now I can't stop thinking about it.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Still, the ice that trapped me was Six-Phased Ice — a very rare substance. I don't think you can find it on your average planet...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: We won't know unless we have a look ourselves.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: This might actually be your homeworld.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: To be honest, I think I'd be kind of annoyed if I found out this was my homeworld. It looks freezing... Pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: ...What? Is there something on my face?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Nah~ I was just imagining all the fun we're gonna have here... hee-hee!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: ...I feel sorry for this world. First the Stellaron, and now you...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Let's go.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Let's go!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Let's... go...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Alright! Here comes, the Jarilo-VI Trailblaze Team!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Jarilo-VI, we're here.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Brrr. It really is one big snowball.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: It really is one big snowball.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Hey, get your own metaphor!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: It doesn't feel that cold.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Well the Trailblaze Path grants us faint power. It allows us to better adapt to harsh environments.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: *sigh* Snow as far as the eye can see. Which direction should we take?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Based on the coordinates, the target should be up ahead.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Why didn't we land at the destination?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: ...Do you want to mention the time we smashed a hole through Taikiyan Stadium, or shall I?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: *sigh* Please stop bringing that up. Let's just say that landings and crowds don't mix.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Unless you enjoy trailblazing through two weeks of community service.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: I said drop it!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: I didn't know we'd be hiking...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Me neither, if only we had a snowmobile... We never get to bring anything cool from the Express.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Do you remember what you did to our last snowmobile?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: ...Anyway, moving on.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Dan Heng]: Remember, we should stay vigilant. We know very little about this world.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Calm down. Between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: I mean c'mon, , you've got a Stellaron in your body, I have my special Six-Phased Ice powers, and Dan Heng... Uhh, he's got that mysterious past thing going for him...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: So, if people start creating trouble for us, they're gonna regret it!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Yeah, they're gonna regret it!
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: ...So how long does "copycatitis" last?
[A Grand Cool Adventure][Narration]: Let's just make sure that we're not the ones creating trouble...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, hehe...
[A Grand Cool Adventure][March 7th]: Let's go. Braving the unknown... that's the real spirit of trailblazing!

[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: This place still hasn't been corroded, yet Fragmentum monsters have already made it here.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: I fear the Stellaron may be exerting a significant influence on this world.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: :
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: :
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: These buildings have been buried in the snowfall.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Huh!? So these are rooftops? How long would snow have to fall to get this thick?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: ...A long, long time.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: *gasp* Did you see that? I think something's moving...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: Mm... It's just an ordinary snowdrift. Are you sure you're not seeing things?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Of course not, my eyesight's perfect! Come on, let's take a closer look.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: ...Hey, get outta there or you'll shiver to death.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Holding your breath won't help...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: I got this, March.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: If someone's got their head stuck in the sand, or the snow in this case...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: ...they just need a helping hand.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Man Hiding in Snow]: Yeowch!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Man Hiding in Snow]: My fine fellow, was that really necessary? Is crawling around in the snow a crime these days? I mean, c'mon, surely it doesn't warrant a spearing?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Man Hiding in Snow]: ...But then again how can I blame you? I mean, I caught you off guard. It had to happen — you could even say I deserved it, huh? Besides, I've made a gallant group of new friends as a result, hehe...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Man Hiding in Snow]: ...Is Captain Gepard around? H—He's an old buddy of mine...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Who?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Man Hiding in Snow]: Wait, you're not Silvermane Guards? Well, why didn't you say so? Turns out we're on the same side after all!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Man Hiding in Snow]: Pleasure to meet you, the name's Sampo Koski.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: I'm .
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Excellent, I'll remember the name. I never thought I'd run into friends from the same line of work out here in this frozen wasteland. *sigh* Business is bad these days, but fear not, Sampo Koski isn't interested in hoarding. There's more than enough treasure to go around, so let's get rich together! Hahaha.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Say, why don't we join forces? I have reliable intel the main strength of the Silvermane Guards is being deployed to the front line. This is a golden opportunity...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: What business are you talking about?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: Silvermane Guards?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: The front line?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: ...Come now, friends. I can understand the mistrust, but there's no need for the charade.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Then again, I know the rules, vigilance is the name of the game in our profession. It's my fault for letting my enthusiasm and sincerity get the better of me...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Anyway, a meeting like this has to have been written in the stars. Ask me anything you like — I won't skimp on the details. Still, make it snappy, you're never more than ten feet from a Silvermane Guard...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: Is there a settlement nearby?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Settlement? What a literary turn of phrase. Why, there's only one place in this world where the living still reside — our beloved Belobog! The further away you get, the dicier things become.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: The City of Preservation, the Towering Citadel, humanity's last bastion against the Eternal Freeze... It may sound a bit over the top, but those names are grounded in truth. The only place humans can eke out an existence is behind those impregnable walls.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: Why were you hiding in the snow?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Me? You guys scared me to death... There I was looking for relics to sell, when all of a sudden you came stomping over. I thought the Silvermane Guards were paying me a visit.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Seriously though, try treading a little lighter next time, hmm? If you run into the Guards, they won't hide in a snowdrift... and you'll be in a cell before you know it.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: I have no idea who these Silvermane Guards even are...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: You...You really don't know? The Silvermane Guards are Belobog's soldiers, enforcers, and police. Let's just say they're not the most flexible of people... and they like paying visits to folks in our line of work.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Seems like you guys really are new to the business. *sigh* To be young and naive again... How about this. As a senior in the field, which I'm sure you don't mind me saying, I'll give you some free guidance.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: There are ways of doing things in this profession, and you better get familiar with them. Moving in the shadows, finding the goods, pricing your stock, hiding from the Guards... there's an art to all of it.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: No need, why don't you just take us to the city? We don't really know the way.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: The city? Already? I haven't even started trading yet. Showing you the way is easy enough, missy, but it would cost—
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: ...B—But it would be my pleasure! "Kindness" is Sampo Koski's middle name. Follow me, friends, and keep quiet. We don't want to be spotted by the Guards.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: So why were you hiding from the Silvermane Guards?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Uhh, I was just storing a few relics away from prying eyes, nothing serious. If it weren't for the uncompromising nature of our civil service, there'd be no need for secrecy.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: So whereabouts are you guys from, anyway? I don't mean to pry or anything, I just care about my friends! No pressure...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: ...Rule number seven: Never leave a footprint. I have my own special technique called "invisible snow-walking." Helps me throw off pursuers in no...time...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: ...Who are they?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Uh, you remember the Silvermane Guards I mentioned? That's them...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Help me, old friends! I don't wanna be caught!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: It's the suspect and his accomplices! Arrest them!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: ,  Silvermane Gunner ×1 ,  Silvermane Soldier ×2 ,  Silvermane Gunner ×1 )
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: It's now or never!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Sampo]: Over to you, dear friends!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Hey! Where do you think you're—
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: ×1 ,  Silvermane Soldier ×1 )
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: I, Gepard Landau, captain of the Silvermane Guards, order you to relinquish your futile resistance.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Grr, that Sampo cheated us all. Wait till I get my hands on him...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: Suspect! Relinquish your resistance!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Ugh, so I'm a criminal, huh? Forget Sampo, wait until I get my hands on YOU!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: ...And the prime suspect? The one with the blue hair?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: Apologies, Captain! W—We lost him during the pursuit. We can't find his footprints...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: *sigh* No matter, we have his accomplices. He'll be close by, plotting his next move.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: We're not his accomplices.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Yeah, we'd never team up with someone like him!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: You might be waiting longer than you think...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: ...As in, forever.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: I'm not trying to talk our way out of this, but... we're not friends with that scoundrel. Did you see how fast he ditched us?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: We rescued him from the snow out of the kindness of our hearts. We had no idea he might be using us to get past you! Are you really dumb enough to fall for his...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: I'm a captain, not an adjudication panel. As a Belobog citizen, you have the right to defend yourself, but that can only take place under the scrutiny of the Architects, not now.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: Take them away.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: But we're not from Belobog!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: Take a look at our clothes.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: Silence! What kind of nonsense are you—
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: As you were. We must not be tempted into careless judgment. Look at their attire. Indeed, it is not in the Belobog style.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Exactly! A—And we even have photos!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: Does our equipment bear any resemblance to yours?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: Silence! What kind of nonsense are you—
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: As you were. We must not be tempted into careless judgment. Look at their relics. We've never excavated anything like them before, and I haven't seen anything similar in our museums.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Exactly! A—And we even have photos!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: Show him the photos, March.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: Photos?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Ah! , you're a genius! Great idea!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: You've probably never seen what your planet looks like, right? I took this one. Behold, Jarilo-VI...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Narration]: March 7th shows Gepard a picture of the ice-covered planet...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: ...You mean to say that this... white ball... That's here? That's our home? How can that...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: ...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: It is said that a long time ago, strange visitors from beyond the sky would visit us here... but that after the Eternal Freeze, the blizzards made passage impossible... and Belobog would cease to witness such arrivals.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Soldier]: But these people are—
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: This decision is beyond us. If what they say is true, then only the supreme guardian may decide their fate.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: Our job is to present them before her. Nothing more.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: Outsiders, follow me. Belobog lies beyond this blizzard.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: Welcome to Belobog — the City of Preservation.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: ...Hey, it feels like it got a bit warmer!
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: ...That's because you're in Belobog, the last bastion of humanity.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: Last bastion?
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: ...
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: Seven hundred years ago, monsters from beyond the sky set the world ablaze. The land was turned to scorched earth, with raging infernos and billowing towers of smoke stretching beyond the horizon.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: In the midst of the conflict, the Eternal Freeze descended without warning. Suddenly, sweeping winds brought blizzards which buried the invading Legion. Belobog was all that remained.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: The steadfast Architects built this city. Under the protection of Qlipoth the Preservation, Belobog remains forever warm in the face of unrelenting cold.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: 
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Dan Heng]: 
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: 
[Travelers on a Winter Night][Gepard]: You wanted to know.
[Travelers on a Winter Night][March 7th]: ...

[Everwinter Night][Narration]: :
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: We saw strange creatures outside the city... They must have come from a tear in corroded space. A Fragmentum, correct?
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: How do you... That's right. Out there in the blizzard, there are still many threats... including the monsters you saw.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Monsters of that type rarely venture outside the Fragmentum... meaning the corrosion affecting your planet is already very serious.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: The Silvermane Guards are continuously engaged with the enemy, but I'm afraid the situation is bleak... After your meeting with the supreme guardian, I would like to consult you on this matter. *sigh* We're lacking in intel.
[Everwinter Night][Kid That Idolizes Gepard]: Look, Captain Gepard's back!
[Everwinter Night][Kid That Idolizes Gepard]: So impressive... I want to become as strong a Silvermane Guard as him!
[Everwinter Night][Excitable Citizen]: What happened? Seems serious...
[Everwinter Night][Excitable Citizen]: Who are those guys behind the captain? Look at their attire, so strange...
[Everwinter Night][Nosy Citizen]: Say, the officer that you were speaking to... was that Gepard Landau?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: That's right.
[Everwinter Night][Nosy Citizen]: Argh, I knew it was him — I wasn't brave enough to go over. I should've tried to stop him.
[Everwinter Night][Nosy Citizen]: Captain Gepard is wise and decisive, and of noble birth... I'm sure he'd help me.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: What do you make of him?
[Everwinter Night][Nosy Citizen]: What do I make of him? Why, he's a captain of the Silvermane Guards — not to mention of noble birth! I mean, he's a Landau!
[Everwinter Night][Nosy Citizen]: If I could just find a way to tell him about my situation, I'm sure he'd help me.
[Everwinter Night][Nosy Citizen]: *sigh* I'm getting ahead of myself, I already missed my chance... back to the queue I guess.
[Everwinter Night][Worried Citizen]: What am I gonna do? Only the Madam Guardian can help me...
[Everwinter Night][Aggressive Citizen]: Hey, you got a problem? If you wanna petition then start queuing. Don't even think about pushing in.
[Everwinter Night][Aggrieved Citizen]: This queue isn't moving, how long are we gonna be here...
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: We're here.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: This is Qlipoth Fort, the heart of Belobog and headquarters of the Architects.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Qlipoth Fort?
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Qlipoth is the symbol of Preservation. Under Qlipoth's impulsion, the Architects constructed Belobog, thus protecting the spark of civilization from disaster and the Eternal Freeze.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: To show our reverence, we named this fortress after the Aeon themself. The Architects, under the protection of Qlipoth, have continued to lead this city forward, repelling all manner of disasters.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: The Architects?
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: The saviors of humanity. Long before the arrival of the Eternal Freeze, the Architects braved the doubts and derision of the people, never wavering from their construction of its defenses. History has proven that their decision was the correct one.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: The Architects named this fortress after Qlipoth, Aeon of Preservation. Under their direction, humanity has withstood external enemy attacks and held off the Eternal Freeze. Even today, we resist the Fragmentum's corrosion.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: This fortress is also the residence of the supreme guardian.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: The supreme guardian?
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: The leader of Belobog, elected and appointed by the Architects. The supreme guardians have watched over this city for generations, sheltering the people from harm.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: The current guardian is Madam Cocolia Rand. Every major strategic decision is issued by her.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Whoa... she sounds like a big deal.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: I will now bring you to see Madam Cocolia. Please have your words at the ready. Her time is precious, so she prefers concise communication.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Uhh... We're gonna see her right now? Can I at least find a place to freshen up first?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Can I tag along?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Let's not waste time. No one will notice.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: You look fine.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: You've got some snow in your hair, but no one will notice.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Is there any etiquette we need to observe?
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Rest easy, the Madam Guardian doesn't care about formalities. Not to mention, you've only just arrived, it would be unexpected if you were familiar with Belobog customs.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: I've dispatched a messenger to send word, Madam Cocolia will be aware of your arrival. Come with me.
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: ...But that's a meaningless sacrifice, how can you—
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Ahem... You may leave, Bronya. Visitors have arrived.
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: ...
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: Yes, mother.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Madam Guardian, I have brought three outsiders to see you.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: The messenger informed me. Well done, Gepard. You may leave.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Welcome, visitors from beyond the Eternal Freeze. Or perhaps I should say: From beyond the sky... no?
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: I am Cocolia Rand, Belobog's supreme guardian. I would be grateful if you could tell me why you have come.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: So you don't doubt our identity?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: So you believe we come from beyond the sky?
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Do you wish me to doubt it? Or perhaps you're not confident in that identity yourself? Haha... No, I do not doubt it. I can see that you are not from this world.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: The Architects remember the history well, else we should forget it. I know that in the distant past, before the Eternal Freeze descended or the Legion invaded, this world was once prosperous beyond measure...
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: An Aeon connected our planet to other worlds, and we discovered the endless possibilities of the boundless universe. We also came to know of Qlipoth, the Amber Lord. Under THEIR attentive gaze, we built the city walls.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: ...So, do not be surprised. For seven hundred years, the Architects have received no further communication from the stars... but I knew of your existence. Tell me why you have come.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: We want to help you.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: We've come to trailblaze this planet.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: ...Do you think anyone's gonna know what you're talking about?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: We came here for something known as a Stellaron.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: A Stellaron?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Objects that fell from the blue on separate worlds. Their appearance spelled disaster. Many of the planets we've visited have suffered their effects.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: You mentioned invasion by the Antimatter Legion. Soon after their arrival, this planet suffered the Eternal Freeze. At the same time, the phenomenon known as Fragmentum space corrosion began to occur. Correct?
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: ...Correct.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: The Stellarons were cast by the Aeon of Destruction.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Which is why the Antimatter Legion and Stellarons often show up together! Worlds seeded with Stellarons give birth to Fragmentums. As for the Eternal Freeze... it must have been a product of the Stellaron — unique to the environment of your world.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: The Eternal Freeze is a product of the Stellaron.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Stellarons bring about different disasters on different worlds. But every world seeded with a Stellaron will give birth to Fragmentums.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Fragmentums are a product of the Stellaron.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Stellarons bring about different disasters on different worlds. But every world seeded with a Stellaron will give birth to Fragmentums.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: You can see us as... kindhearted interstellar public servants, lending a helping hand to any world affected by a Stellaron!
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: ...
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Your analysis of our current circumstances is clear. We have indeed suffered the disasters you speak of, some of which prove vexatious to us even today... but why should you care?
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Even if this Stellaron you speak of did bring about disaster, I fail to see its connection to you. I don't believe that anyone would go to such lengths to help a world unrelated to them... unless they had something to gain.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: You're right. Our reason for coming here is not purely selfless. If we don't seal the Stellaron, we cannot leave this planet.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Please let us help you.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Yeah! FYI, we're pretty awesome.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Please help us locate the Stellaron.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: If we can get rid of it, your world will be safer too!
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: You... know how to seal the "Stellaron"?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: We have the relevant means.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Very well, I believe you. If our present situation is truly the result of this so-called Stellaron, then your arrival is the hope that Belobog has waited seven hundred years for. I am willing to assist you in any way possible to help you locate the Stellaron.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: It's getting late, and you must be tired. I will arrange for you to stay in our most comfortable hotel. Rest there, and get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow, at noon, I will dispatch someone to escort you here, and we can discuss this urgent matter in greater detail.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Thank you, Supreme Guardian.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: It should be me thanking you, visitors from beyond the sky.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: We'd like to take a look around.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: But of course. You are Belobog's honored guests, and have the highest privileges afforded to you.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: I too need some time. I will go over our records for anything that may be connected to Stellarons... Please excuse me for not escorting you further.
[Everwinter Night][???]: ...
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: ...Of course I understand.
[Everwinter Night][Cocolia]: Do not worry, I have a way.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: It seems that the supreme guardian holds you in high regard. I have received orders that your movements are no longer to be restricted.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: She's an impressive figure.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: She's the big shot! Definitely got that "queen of the castle" vibe going on. Aww, so cool.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: She's very reasonable.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Y'know, I didn't think things were gonna go that smoothly.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Haha. I'm afraid I still have duties to attend to. I must return to my post. I hope you enjoy your stay in Belobog.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Wait! Can you recommend some sights? It's not that late, we wanna take a look around.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Well, I'd say that Golden Theater and the History Museum are both worth a look. However, you'd need a pass to get into the museum.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: I recommend you visit Everwinter Monument first — it's Belobog's most symbolic landmark.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: And if you enjoy music, you could head to Neverwinter Workshop. You can sometimes catch an outdoor performance there. The artist is... *sigh* You'll see.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Oh, and if you're staying at Goethe Hotel, please avoid the alley that runs next to it — the one with Silvermane Guards stationed there. It started to be affected by corrosion recently, so it's been sealed off.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: So the corrosion is inside the city... that's a grave situation.
[Everwinter Night][Gepard]: Yes, we're mounting a resistance as we speak. I must leave now, I hope all goes well for you.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Neverwinter Workshop... Hey! Didn't Gepard say there'd be a show here?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: He said "you can sometimes catch an outdoor performance..." "Sometimes" being the operative word.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Darn, I wanted to see one...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Oh — I've been wondering — you see that heater over there? Why do they keep it outdoors? This city is so weird...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Normally you'd want a heater INSIDE a building, right?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Is this how they repel the Eternal Freeze?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: ...If so, I'm not sure "mighty" is the right word for these Architects.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Maybe they have indoor heaters too.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Maybe, but the ones outside just seem like a waste of energy.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: *gasp* Maybe this is how the Architects repel the Eternal Freeze!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Tiny heaters are no use against a Stellaron disaster.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Distinctively-Dressed Woman: Hah, you guys sure have a lot to say about that broken heater.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Oh wow — she's cool!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Hi, hello.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Distinctively-Dressed Woman: Hi there. The name's Serval, I'm the owner of this workshop.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Broken?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Distinctively-Dressed Woman: Yep, touch it and find out — ice cold. I was just about to fix it up.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Distinctively-Dressed Woman: I forgot to introduce myself. The name's Serval, I'm the owner of this workshop.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: If you got any broken equipment lying around you can always come find me, though I can't guarantee I'll be interested in fixing it.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Oh, we're okay, I was just curious about the heater...
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Curious? About the heater? It's just a standard Geomarrow radiator — you can find them anywhere in the Administrative District.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: We only just got here — everything's new to us.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: ...Only just got here?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Standing broken machines outside a workshop is bad advertising.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Huh? What's wrong with that? Everyone around here knows the way I work...
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Ah! I've figured it out! I heard a loudmouthed guard say that a group of outsiders had met with Cocolia... You must be them?
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: What an honor! Where are my manners — we can talk about heaters all day if you like. Let's have a chat~
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: The heater you saw is just a standard Geomarrow radiator. They may not look like much, but they're a real lifeline to the people.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: The blizzards here are brutal. If we didn't have a reliable way of keeping warm, Belobog would long since have become a dead city — both above and below the surface.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: What is Geomarrow?
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: It's an ore — a special energy resource. Whether it's keeping the city warm or keeping our counters ticking, everything runs on Geomarrow.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Geomarrow grows beneath the surface of the planet, and specialist Underworld mining teams are there to extract it. Transport lines shuttle it up to the surface. In the Overworld, we use the same lines to ship surface goods and aid down to the Underworld.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Above and beneath the surface?
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: You didn't know? Belobog is structured like two big connected discs. The Overworld is responsible for administration and trade, while the Underworld is responsible for energy supply and resource extraction.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: However, due to an order that was given many years ago, nobody has moved between the Overworld and the Underworld in a long time.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: ...Ah! I shouldn't be talking about this. Pretend I never said anything.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Why is the heater outside?
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Isn't it just like cooking food over an open flame? If the house is a pot, then the heater is the stove it rests on.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: When she puts it like that, it actually starts to make sense...
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Thanks for your answers.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: No sweat. This is your first time in Belobog — I just want you to feel some of the warmth the city has to offer.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Hey, seeing as there's nothing on your plate just now, wanna help me fix up this machine? Just a bit of manual labor — you might find it interesting.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Sure, we're not busy.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Great! Then let me give you a demonstration first.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Nice! You guys are pretty handy — you picked that up in no time. Wanna be my assistants? Average pay, but I'm a good boss.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Sure, why not.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Hah — do you just say yes to everything?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Allow me to refuse.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Hahaha, I was only kidding — just a joke.
[Everwinter Night][Serval]: Well, I'd better carry on here, why not have a better look around? My workshop will always be open to you... and your wallets, of course.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Ah, that's the alley that Gepard mentioned — the one contaminated by the Fragmentum, right?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: I can't believe how close it is to the city center...
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: If they hadn't identified it, I bet all the shops and hotels in the vicinity would have had to close down by now.
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Move back! This is your final warning!
[Everwinter Night][Distressed Citizen]: But... B—But my proof of property is inside. I don't have any—
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: The Fragmentum has already corroded this block! You can make a property retrieval request to the Architects, but only Silvermane Guards are permitted to enter here!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: I can't believe Fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city... No wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: This world really is in dire straits.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: It sure is... but at least we're here. Once we seal the Stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Can soldiers really hold back the Fragmentum?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: No. As long as the Stellaron is active, the corrosion will continue to spread.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: The soldiers can only periodically clear the Fragmentum of monsters. But the monsters will continue to emerge and multiply.
[Everwinter Night][Composed Silvermane Guard]: Please try to understand, sir. Backwater Pass has become very dangerous. We're just here for your safety.
[Everwinter Night][Distressed Citizen]: If I can't get my proof of property, it doesn't matter how safe I am! Out of my way — let me pass...
[Everwinter Night][Silvermane Guard]: *sigh*
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Stand back! This area is off limits — only Silvermane Guards are permitted to enter here!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Are the Guards able to control the situation?
[Everwinter Night][Composed Silvermane Guard]: We're optimistic — this area has only recently been corroded, so monsters are few and far between. Please, have faith in the Guards.
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: If it weren't for most of our forces being deployed to the front line, situations like this wouldn't amount to anything! We can't even go on the offensive.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: What's down there?
[Everwinter Night][Composed Silvermane Guard]: It used to be a transport hub... but it's been closed down.
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Darn monsters!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: This must be a hard job.
[Everwinter Night][Composed Silvermane Guard]: Well, this is our duty as Silvermane Guards. We are responsible for the safety of the citizenry.
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Duty is duty — we trust in the higher-ups! But I worry about our compatriots below ground. They must be—
[Everwinter Night][Composed Silvermane Guard]: That's enough, the guardian has strictly forbidden discussion of Underworld affairs...
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Right! I'm such a hothead. I'll zip it!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[Everwinter Night][Composed Silvermane Guard]: Please keep a safe distance, this is a live situation. Plus, we need to look busy.
[Everwinter Night][Distressed Citizen]: Let me pass! I'm not afraid to die! I've lost everything... everything...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Wow, look at the carved ice! It feels perfect for this city, somehow.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Whatever it's made of, it can't be ice.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: I guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city... Hey, what's with all the children over there? Should we go and take a look?
[Everwinter Night][Girl in Silvermane Guard Uniform]: So, let me introduce myself. I'm the Intelligence Officer for the Silvermane Guards, and a temporary guide for the "A Journey Through Belobog's History" program. My name is Pelageya Sergeyevna.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: But you can call me Pela.
[Everwinter Night][Children]: Yes~ Miss~ Pela~
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Yes~ Miss~ Pela~
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: ...And perhaps the grownups among us could refrain from acting like children?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Pelageya Sergeyevna...
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: ...And perhaps the grownups among us could remain silent? This is a children's program...
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Okay guys, take a look over here: This is Everwinter Monument. It was erected to commemorate the mighty Architects.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: The Architects are followers of the Aeon Qlipoth. It was they that foresaw crisis, built up our walls, and established Belobog — preserving the spark of human civilization. Even today, they are still tending to the city.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Everwinter Monument is made up of two parts: A gear that symbolizes knowledge and industrial strength, and huge ice crystals that symbolize the Eternal Freeze. These two symbols are bound together — the gear restricting the ice. It represents the unyielding spirit of the Architects in the face of nature's barbarity.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Any questions~?
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Any questions~?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Does the monument have any symbolic meaning?
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: The monument is made up of two parts: A gear that symbolizes knowledge and industrial strength, and huge ice crystals that symbolize the Eternal Freeze. These two symbols are bound together — the gear restricting the ice. It represents the unyielding spirit of the Architects in the face of nature's barbarity.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: What are those blue crystals?
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: You mean, what are they made of? It's Geomarrow that's undergone a change in color. The color of Geomarrow is related to the environmental temperature during its refinement.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Who are the Architects?
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: The Architects are followers of the Aeon Qlipoth. It was they that foresaw the crisis, built up our walls, and established Belobog — preserving the spark of human civilization.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Or to put it another way, the Architects are Belobog's founders and saviors. Even today, they are still tending to the city.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: How did the Eternal Freeze occur?
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: That's a question for the Scientific Research Division, though they may not be able to give you a definitive answer.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: The Eternal Freeze is no ordinary natural disaster — meteorological records from hundreds of years ago cannot explain the cause. To put it simply, it's a problem that has plagued Belobog scientists for centuries.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: And what about you guys? Take your time, we're not in a rush.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: *yawn* ...So tired. I just wanna put my head on a pillow and drift off...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Seems like the first day of our trailblazing expeditions is always pretty eventful, huh Dan Heng.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Heh, that's because you've got too much energy.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: (Upon walking into the Hotel Lobby
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Wow, what a beautiful lobby! It's gonna be soft mattresses and cushiony pillows tonight!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Wanna have a pillow fight later? Huh? Huh? I bet they're stuffed with goose feathers, haha!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: March, earlier in Qlipoth Fort—
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Stop! I know what you're gonna say: "March, you said too much back there — March, you shouldn't reveal our goal to people we don't trust..." Meanwhile you guys were beating around the bush and speaking in riddles.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: But check it out — seems like we landed with a pretty sweet deal, right? We get the royal treatment, rooms in a beauuuutiful hotel, and the full support of the locals! As far as trailblazing goes, this is smooth as heck!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: ...That's... not what I was going to say.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Alright, spit it out then.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Earlier in Qlipoth Fort... were you paying attention to the Supreme Guardian?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Uhh, yeah, of course — this isn't my first expedition y'know. My powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Soooo, did you notice anything?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Nope, she seemed normal to me. She was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: I knew there was something up with her!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Something up with her? She seemed normal to me. She was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: ...Am I the only one that didn't notice anything?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Nope, she seemed normal to me too. She was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Although... it felt like she was looking through me. As in, I know she was speaking to us, but it seemed like her gaze was fixed on something far away...
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Hmm, I had a similar feeling. Almost as if we weren't the only people in the room.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: *gasp* Do you have to put it like that? That's scary...
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: It must've been the invisible man.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Well, there's no way he'd get past Dan Heng's sharp eyes.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: It must've been a guard.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Hmm, maybe. She's an important person after all — maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: You guys are overthinking things...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Haha, it's possible.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Perhaps I'm too sensitive... She did promise to help us. I just hope she keeps her word...
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Let's get some rest, we need to save our energy for the discussions tomorrow.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Is there anything left to do? We're meeting the guardian tomorrow. There won't be any time for sightseeing.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: That's enough fun for today. Time to rest.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Let's have another stroll.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: It was a long day today. All I need is a hot shower and a good night's sleep.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Sleep well guys!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: *yawn* You too!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: I've got a bad feeling...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Well don't talk about it then!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Let's get to bed early and save our energy. I sense the next few days could be tiring.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Well, I'm off to my room then. Express lights off!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: It was a long day today. All I need is a hot shower and a good night's sleep.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Sleep well guys!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: *yawn* You too!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: I've got a bad feeling...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Well don't talk about it then!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Didn't someone mention a pillow fight?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Yeah! About time!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Let's get to bed early and save our energy. I sense the next few days could be tiring.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Well, I'm off to my room then. Express lights off!
[Everwinter Night][Voice of the Stellaron]: Cocolia... Cocolia...
[Everwinter Night][Teenage Cocolia]: Wh—Who are you...? ...What are you?
[Everwinter Night][Voice of the Stellaron]: We are allies... allies of the guardians through generations.
[Everwinter Night][Teenage Cocolia]: What do you want...?
[Everwinter Night][Voice of the Stellaron]: To rebuild... this dying world...
[Everwinter Night][Voice of the Stellaron]: To help you... achieve your wish.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Hey, . Did you hear that?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: There's a group of Silvermane Guards at the entrance... and I don't think they're here to say hi.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: If this is our escort, it's less friendly than I was expecting.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: You guys are assuming a lot. All I can see is their helmets.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: ...I just have a feeling.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: You can't always be friendly on the job, you know.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Huh, you must've had some miserable jobs.
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Maybe they're not here to escort us?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: I guess we'll have to find out...
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Let's go and meet them. We won't know until we're down there.
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Hey! Commander Bronya is waiting for you all down below. Hurry up and go see her. And no tricks!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Are we... in a lot of trouble?
[Everwinter Night][Stern Silvermane Guard]: Suspects! Stop running around and go see Commander Bronya!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Suspects!? That's not good...
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Huh? It's you... you were there at the Fort...
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: I am Bronya Rand, acting commander of the Silvermane Guards. In the name of the Amber Lord in the highest, and under order of Supreme Guardian Cocolia Rand, I hereby arrest the suspected infiltrators under the charge of plotting to incite rebellion.
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: As agent of the supreme guardian, I herewith temporarily strip you of your freedom of action and speech. When you are tried by the adjudication panel, you will be given the opportunity to defend yourselves against the accusations.
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: Resistance will prove futile. You must come with me.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: W—Wait a minute! This isn't what we agreed! She said we were gonna be escorted to discuss an urgent matter!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: ...This is an orchestrated betrayal, obviously.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices... again. Seems like it's every third planet this happens.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: That's because you always act without thinking — you never have a plan.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Hey, I'm improving! I'm coming up with a plan right now... aaaand... got one!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: , Dan Heng, the alley!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: The one that's been sealed off... Hmm, it's possible.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: , March, be ready to make an escape.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Huh? Really? I just wanted to say something...
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: It's now or never!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: You sounded pretty convincing!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: We should probably go with them...
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Three of a kind...
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Huh?
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: I guess we are a strange trio...
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: ...Can we focus, please?
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Shh! It's an old Astral Express escape signal. Do you play cards?
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Two Pair...
[Everwinter Night][Silvermane Guard]: Hey, what are you whispering? Let's get going!
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Ace!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Argh, hey!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Have an "ice" day!
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: They charged straight in!
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: ...Escaping into a Fragmentum. I don't know if they're overconfident or just eager for death. It would seem that mother's judgment was correct...
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Should we report them as missing or deceased?
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: ...
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: The supreme guardian's order was to arrest them. We cannot abandon our pursuit just because they fled into a sealed off area. I must ascertain their fate with my own eyes.
[Everwinter Night][Pela]: Y—Yes, ma'am.
[Everwinter Night][Bronya]: Eradicate all threats to Belobog's security... that is what I must do.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Hah! See, they weren't brave enough to follow us! Freedom!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Serves them right! Better luck next time, slowpokes!
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: That was too risky.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Oh please, it's the result that counts~ Gotta take risks sometimes if you wanna succeed~
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: Great work!
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Hehe, it was a team effort~
[Everwinter Night][Narration]: We got lucky.
[Everwinter Night][March 7th]: Well, you can get good at getting lucky~
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: We caught them by surprise, nothing more. They'll be in pursuit soon enough.
[Everwinter Night][Dan Heng]: Let's follow the path. We need to guarantee our own safety before making any further plans.

[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: So what happened back there? Why did the supreme guardian send people to arrest us?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Imagine launching a surprise attack when your enemy is fast asleep. The cheek!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: That woman had a troubling aura... our instincts were correct.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Wait! There are Silvermane Guards here. Careful not to alert them!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: They must have entered from another direction to cut us off.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: We should avoid an open conflict. Let's find another path.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate... Ooh, check this mechanism out. Look familiar?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: Yes, we saw one in Serval's workshop.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: We need to solve it before we run out of time. The Guards are right on our heels.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Narration]: Mission DescriptionYou rush into the Fragmentum to avoid getting caught. How come things went downhill so quickly? March 7th has no clue — she's written as an innocent and sweet teenage girl after all.Despite the initial shock, you quickly agree on the course of action: find the way out of the Fragmentum first. Everything else can wait.You successfully open the metal door. All that's left is to carefully find a way out while avoiding being caught by the Silvermane Guards.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: I don't see a switch for the gate.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Ah! Over there!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: There's a monster in the area. We'll need to deal with it first.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: Look out!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: She really caught up with us...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Even had time to set up an ambush...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Hmph, you dare underestimate me?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Even though it has suffered Fragmentum corrosion, this is still part of Belobog. It was our home. The Guards know this place like the back of their hand.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Enough cat and mouse — drop your weapons and come with me.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Ugh, you're such a nuisance! Just what crime are we supposed to have committed again? It better be worth you following us all the way out here!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: My orders are to arrest you. It is for the adjudication panel to present you with the nature and penalty of your alleged crimes.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: You saw us yesterday, do you remember? Madam Cocolia received us as honored guests.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: How can such a drastic change have occurred in the course of one night?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: ...The Madam Guardian investigated your backgrounds.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: She summoned me last night to tell me that you had deceived her. Your identities and purpose here are counterfeit. You seek to overthrow the rule of the Architects.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Ah! What a two-faced hag!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Publicly insulting the supreme guardian only elevates the seriousness of your crimes. Throw down your arms and surrender!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: We're wasting our words, March. At least one thing is clear: We mustn't be caught.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Well, if there's no escape, then maybe it's time we gave them a taste of Astral Express medicine!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Narration]: ,  Silvermane Gunner ×1 )
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Ah...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: Duck!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Ahhhh!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Silvermane Soldier]: Lady Bronya...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Hm...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: I'll handle these evildoers...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Myself!
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: This girl's pretty strong... Hey Dan Heng, maybe now's a good time to show off your secret strength!?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Dan Heng]: ...You first.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: Ugh, you're no fun.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: Intruders, give it up! You will be guaranteed a fair trial.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Ooh! Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the intensity of the moment~
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Bronya]: *gasp* What is this?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][March 7th]: ...I can't breathe...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: I have one thing to say:
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Sampo never lets friends who've helped him come to harm.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: I say what I mean... and I mean what I say.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Young Cocolia]: ...They will suffer, sacrifice, and die because of my order.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Voice of the Stellaron]: It is not death which greets them... They will be swept into the infancy of a new world.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Young Cocolia]: What about the Underworlders? They will lose the protection of the Architects. They will see me... as a tyrant.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Voice of the Stellaron]: You have witnessed... the world we have promised.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Voice of the Stellaron]: A temporary misunderstanding... for an eternity of prosperity.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Voice of the Stellaron]: We will honor... your decision.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Young Cocolia]: ...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Young Cocolia]: I understand.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: *sigh* ...Come on, those toys of yours aren't that dangerous.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Uh, then why hasn't  woken up yet?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: Because  sound asleep — didn't you hear  sleep talking? ...Poor child, sounded like a bad nightmare.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: Tell me the truth Sampo — what are you gonna do about the Overworld girl?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: What am I gonna do about her? Why, wait for the opportunity and send her back together with the rest of them of course, I... Hey come on, what's with the—
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: You're a bad liar, Sampo Koski.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Wha— ...I didn't mean to bring her along! The smoke was too dense, I was in a daze! Before I knew it, I'd somehow dragged her down here too.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: What are you up to, Sampo? Why do you insist on getting caught up in Overworld affairs that have nothing to do with you? If it's a whole lot more attention from Wildfire you want, you're going about it the right way.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Hey now! Sampo Koski's primary concern is taking care of his friends. These guys scratched my back. How could I live with myself if I didn't scratch theirs?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: And another thing! Where does Wildfire get off... assuming that these fine folks won't come in useful to them, huh? I mean, you never know.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: Which is why you've set them loose in the underground?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Come on, accidents happen! I'll have them rounded up in no time.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: *sigh* That girl... get her back as soon as possible, then don't let her out of your sight. The underground has been sealed off for over ten years now — the children won't even remember what overgrounders look like. If a girl in a Silvermane Guard uniform suddenly shows up...
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: ...what would Wildfire do with her? What would they do with you?
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][Sampo]: Alright, I get it! I'm setting off right now. I'll have to trouble you to look after them while I'm gone, ma'am.
[You Can Run, But You Can't Hide][???]: ...Hey sleepyhead, looks like you're awake.

[Hide-and-seek][???]: How are you feeling? Any aches or pains?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: No, I feel much better.
[Hide-and-seek][???]: Good. You were out for a while, I was beginning to worry. You were saying some strange things.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I've got migraines all over my body.
[Hide-and-seek][???]: ...I hope you're joking, hehe... That's either an interesting metaphor, or you hit your head.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I had a weird dream...
[Hide-and-seek][???]: I bet, you were mumbling something about "Stellarons" and "wishes"... I couldn't make sense of it.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. I'm Natasha — a doctor in the underground. You've already spent a day in my clinic.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Nice to meet you, I'm .
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Nice to meet you too... Hehe, you're very polite.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Is this the underground?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Yes... it's a place that's been sealed off and neglected by the overgrounders for more than a decade. The underground has none of the splendor of the surface — the people here dig tunnels and mine ore to make a living.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: This is your clinic?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Mm-hmm, I'm afraid the conditions underground are terrible. People get sick easily here, and I'm the only doctor.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Sampo's gone to clear up a mess of his own making, so I'm looking after you in the meantime. Based on your current state, I don't think there's any cause for alarm — you seem perfectly healthy.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: So if you don't mind, I'll go and take a look at the other patients?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Why did I pass out?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. He didn't say why. Still, I'll wager it had something to do with him — he's always tinkering with his devices.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Anyway, the opinion of the clinic is that none of you have come to harm.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: People were following us...
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Sampo told me. Don't worry, the Silvermane Guards won't follow you below ground. We've been cut off from the surface for many years. Even when things were at their worst down here, they never showed.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: ...Of course, I don't know the whole story behind why the Architects ordered the lockdown. Who knows, thanks to you, they might finally be about to lift it... something that Wildfire's wanted to achieve for a long time now.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: What's our medical bill...
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Oh, please, you needn't worry. You've just been asleep for a while, I barely had to lift a finger.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: I... might've exaggerated your condition for Sampo's ears... but that guy owes me. He better bring me back some medicine.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Where are my friends?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: They've been up for a while already. The young guy with the dark hair left first — he went with Sampo.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. I imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: As for the girl in the Silvermane Guard uniform, I told Sampo to watch her... but it seems that he left his post and she made a run for it.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Who is this Sampo anyway?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Good question... he's a man of mystery. He claims to be a simple cross-border businessman — not that there's much to interest an Overworlder down here. Either way, he's got a surprising number of connections.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: I've managed to secure more than a few urgent medical supplies through him, and he's been a big help to Wildfire... In any case, I don't think his intentions are sinister.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I need to meet up with them.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Sure, but don't push yourself. If you start feeling unwell, come straight back and tell me.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: ...And if you run into any trouble, you can try asking for Wildfire.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Wildfire?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: It's a grassroots organization. Think of it as the Silvermane Guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Thank you, Dr. Natasha.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I can't thank you enough. Bye for now.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: No need to thank me. It's a doctor's duty to heal.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: :
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Y'know, the underground has been cut off from the surface for years. For you outsiders to descend on us out of nowhere is pretty incredible.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Everything alright? You feeling okay?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I want to ask about the Underworld...
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: The Underworld? What do you want to know?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Why do people live down here?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Because we need Geomarrow. After Belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. The Eternal Freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: The people answered the call of the Architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. Before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: It was a choice... the pursuit of arduous labor for the survival of our entire civilization.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: How is life in the Underworld?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: ...It's never been good. Conditions are tough both above and below the surface. The Overworld is faced with the Eternal Freeze and Fragmentum corrosion, and the Underworld has to contend with hard labor, suffocating heat, and serious shortages.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: It's been over a decade since the Silvermane Guards withdrew from the Underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. The only contact we have is the exchange of Geomarrow for goods.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: And what's more... the Fragmentum corrosion has begun to reach us down here, too...
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I want to ask something else.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I want to ask about Sampo...
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Ask away, but I'm afraid I don't know a lot about him myself.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: How did you get to know him?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: A meticulously choreographed "chance meeting..." Sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: According to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Do you know where he went?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Hehe, I hear that question a lot — seems like he owes everyone something. That's why he never discloses his whereabouts.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: When people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. Sampo's first and second laws of motion.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I want to ask something else.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I want to ask about Wildfire...
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: ...I'm a doctor, not an informant! Very well, what's the question?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: What is Wildfire?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. Like I said, you can think of it as the Silvermane Guards of the underground.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: They've taken on the duties of the Guards: Maintain safety and order in the Underworld and compete with Fragmentum corrosion for living space.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: How can I find them?
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Wherever there is hardship and a cry for help, there is Wildfire.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: ...You can always find them.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I want to ask something else.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I'm fine.
[Hide-and-seek][Natasha]: Okay, take care, and make sure you look after yourself.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: ...So you promise that if I win hide-and-seek, you'll tell big sister March all the ins and outs.
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Yep! All the ins and outs, hehe! ...What does that mean?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: It just means you'll tell me all the details. No hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Hmph, Hook isn't an overgrounder y'know! Hook never tells fibs!
[Hide-and-seek][Julian]: Yeah, never!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Well, that's settled then~ Okay, let's play... Huh?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: You... When did you get here?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I've been here a while.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Uh... th—this isn't just hide-and-seek, okay? Let me explain...
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Does it matter?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Uh... th—this isn't just hide-and-seek, okay? Let me explain...
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Not that long... big sister.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Quit acting like a child!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: It's like this: After I woke up, that doctor said Sampo had taken Dan Heng with him. I went around in circles trying to find the blue-haired scoundrel, and bumped into these kids. They say they know where he is!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: But they said I had to join "The Moles" or something if I wanted to find out... and to do that, I had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek... do you get it?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I get it. Need a teammate?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Huh. , when did you start being so nice?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I get it. Well, best of luck.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: , you just got here and now you're gonna leave? Play hide-and-seek with me!
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I get it. You're being bullied by children.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: ...Ugh, so what if I am! , why don't you help me, huh!?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Hey, are you done with your secret talk!? The Moles' time is precious!
[Hide-and-seek][Julian]: Yeah, precious!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Okay, okay, we're done. Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, this is my friend, .  also wants to join The Moles. Can  play too?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Ummmm... sure. I guess so. Then... you guys are seeking!
[Hide-and-seek][Julian]: ...Boss! They don't seem very smart. Why don't we do a practice one first?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Hmm... you're right Julian. Okay, let's do a practice one. I'll hide, you two have to find me!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: So you kids think you're better than us, huh? Just you wait and see!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: , it's simple. When you see one of them, you just have to catch them!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Ha! Gotcha!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: S—So what, it's just a practice! Wait until we're playing for real — you'll see!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Hehe, bring it on!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Alright, now we're playing for real! You gotta count to fifty before you open your eyes — no cheating!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: 47... 48... 49... 50!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Hehe~ Ready or not, here I come, naughty children...
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: The Moles haven't lost a game for ages! You're doomed!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: You got it yet? We're the underground's greatest hiders and seekers!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Hey, where are you going?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Come back, come back, they won't be hiding that far away!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Don't run! I got you, Hook!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: N—Not fair! I'm the boss of The Moles — how can I lose to a bunch of villains!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Do your worst! I'm not afraid.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: What are they feeding you kids down here...
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Haha, I caught you!
[Hide-and-seek][Cunning Child]: Hmph, doesn't count unless you can answer this question.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Okay, let's hear it.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Show me the rule book.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Wha—! But we caught you! What's with the Q&A?
[Hide-and-seek][Cunning Child]: ...*sigh* I thought I had you there.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Hmm... something's not right...
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: That guy's been staring at us this whole time... Hide-and-seek might have to wait — let's see what he wants.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: ...
[Hide-and-seek][Seemingly Adult Man]: ...
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: My instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but...
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: It's him, no doubt.
[Hide-and-seek][Seemingly Adult Man]: Nonsense! Ahem! How many eight-year-olds do you see walking around that look like this, huh?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: He's looking taller... and older.
[Hide-and-seek][Seemingly Adult Man]: That's because I'm tall... and old! I'm a grown man! Ask anyone!
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Looks like an adult to me...
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: ...With a child's brain...?
[Hide-and-seek][Seemingly Adult Man]: Well here's the truth: I'm a grown man!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Alright, the jig is up, your voice gave it away...
[Hide-and-seek][Julian]: ...Argh! But I'm Julian of a Thousand Faces! *sigh* Why did you have to talk to me! My reputation is ruined... What will the boss think!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: No need for the melodrama. That was still a magical performance...
[Hide-and-seek][Julian]: I... *sigh* I'm sorry boss! I failed...
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Darn! How did you see through Julian's disguise? What villainy is this?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Hehehe... "Those with keen eyes see the dust between the stars!" I came up with that, by the way.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: With my help!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Yeah, yeah, you're in the footnote somewhere~
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: You sure did!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: About time I got some credit for it!
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: Doesn't sound like something you'd say...
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Hey! I read books y'know!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: So, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, you can tell us now, right?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Ummmm... Yes. The boss of The Moles is true to her word!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Hook saw the blue-haired guy take your dark-haired friend to the Fight Club.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: The Fight Club?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: I thought the first rule was...
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: ...You don't talk about it...
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Is this more secret talk?
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: That doesn't sound good!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: No kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Uh, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, where is the Fight Club? Can you show us the way?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Hmm~ But it's an obvious building, grown-ups are just useless~
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Come with Hook, I'll take you over.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Thanks, o great one.
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: That's Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, to you! Who said you could shorten my title!?
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: A club just for fighting... who knew undergrounders had such brutal hobbies.
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Mm-hmm, in fact, it's awesome!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: They let YOU take part!? When did this place last have an inspection!
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Loads of kids take part.
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: ...Despicable. My "criminal activity" senses are tingling.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: : Agh, gotta stick close to Hook...
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: We're here! This is it.
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Hook's gonna go fight. See ya later!
[Hide-and-seek][March 7th]: Who's in charge here? How can they just let kids attack each other...?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: The Moles are in charge, that's who! ...But only of the kids. Wildfire is in charge of grown-up business.
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: So The Moles control this whole area?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Umm, The Moles control everything underground!
[Hide-and-seek][Narration]: How much do you know about Wildfire?
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Umm, it's... The Moles for grown-ups...
[Hide-and-seek][Hook]: Ooh! They need one more player there! I—I gotta go! If you ever wanna fight, come find me!

[The Eighth and Final Rule][Hook]: There are so many people here — Hook's too short. I can't see anything...
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Hook]: Wha—! When did you... D—Did you hear what Hook was saying?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Not a single word.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Hook]: Good. Hook didn't say anything, and you didn't hear it.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Not a single word about you saying you're too short.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Hook]: Hehe, good. Wait a second... You did too hear everything Hook was saying!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Hook]: Hmph, grown-up fights are less fun than ours. So what if I can't see!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Hook]: You have to use your fists, palms, and even your fingers in combat! If you don't know how, you're done for! You need to train until your body is an extension of the mind... and the mind is an extension of your will.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Fists, palms, and fingers... *gasp* Rock, paper, scissors! Phew! No wonder I was confused!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Curious Spectator]: I heard a new fighter showed up at the club — young guy, dark hair. They say he's invincible! Where did he come from?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Inquiring Spectator]: I heard someone say he's an elite Silvermane Guard.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Curious Spectator]: Don't be ridiculous. The Silvermane Guards have been gone for ages. Why would one suddenly appear out of the blue?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: ...Brothers and sisters! Are you ready for today's most spectacular, spine-tingling, earth-shattering contest!?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: On one side — recommended by Tall, Blue, and Handsome — the unsmiling pulverizing power of the new kid on the block: Cold Dragon Young!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: And his opponent is... none other than the unfeeling, incendiary, explosive might of Team Robomatic! All praise to Boss Svarog!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: Given that no other fighter was willing to take on the strength of Team Robomatic, Cold Dragon Young will face off against these opponents alone! On learning his fate, the brave young fighter had one thing to say: "Whatever!"
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: And so, let the semifinals of the 1758th Fighting King Challenge... begin!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: , quick! Let's help him!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: Oh-ho? Brothers and sisters, an unexpected turn of events... Two members of the audience have charged into the octagon! It looks like they want to team up with Cold Dragon Young!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: ...So you're awake?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Yeah! The first thing  and I did was go look for you! And now that we've found you, we're trying to make sure you don't get your butt kicked! You're welcome~
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: Brothers and sisters, you can feel their passion! The magnetic pull of this electric sport is undeniable! But let me reiterate: These competitions are for professionals only! Whatever you do kids, don't try this at home!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: And Cold Dragon Young is signaling that the contest will go ahead! He's just itching to get into it! And so are we! It's the iron fists of Cold Dragon Young — and friends — versus the iron skin of Team Robomatic!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: I can take them on my own, you know.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: ...*sigh* We need to work on your emotional intelligence.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Hold the line!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Destroy them all!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: I just want to go home!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: )
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Dr. Dig: Oh! What a beautiful performance! Cold Dragon Young and his last-minute admirers emerge victoriouuuus!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Admirers... How come we don't get cool nicknames!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Cold Dragon Younger and Cold Dragon Youngest?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Cooler than Cold Dragon Young...?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: *sigh* Forget it. I think our taste in nicknames is different.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Hey! Look! It's Sampo!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: We've got an explanation to demand.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: We've got another butt to kick.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: We should thank him.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: ???
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: Let's get after him.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: That guy can't have gotten too far! Let's search nearby.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: H—Hey! It's you! I was just thinking to myself: "Am I getting robbed? Who are these people following me?" So, y'know, you start to walk a little faster, and... Anyhoo if I'd just turned around, I could've thrown open my arms and said a big "hi" to my old friends.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Save it. You saw us in there and got scared, so you pulled a runner.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Me? Scared? Hahaha, my friends, what do I have to fear? *gasp* Surely I haven't done anything to offend you?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: You threw us to the Silvermane Guards.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa rewind. If I hadn't made a break for it, Gepard would've caught all of us. And do you think he would've given you a chance to explain yourselves? Hmm? He would've checked you straight into the graybar hotel!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Meanwhile, there I was, looking out for you from the shadows! Do you know how difficult it was to make an entrance? They were watching you the whole time!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: You set Dan Heng up.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Set him up? Yeah, with a job! You guys are new here, and let me tell you — you're gonna need some cash.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: And, Sampo Koski stops at nothing to help his friends. Saving you was just the beginning — I have to consider your finances too! With me you get the full service, folks. That's friendship.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Nah, we're just messing with you.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: ...My fine fellow, please don't do that again. You scared the daylights outta me.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Wait a minute, we're not done here! You dragged us to the underground — so what's the big idea?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: I had no choice but to take you guys down here. It was too dangerous for us on the surface — we're wanted criminals!? Sure, the Underworld has its drawbacks, but at least the Guards would never follow us. We're safe here...
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: Be that as it may, did you really have to poison us?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Maybe you've forgotten, but we were in a tight spot my friend — there was no time to think. I had to use whatever I could.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: Hmm.. So it wasn't to cover anything up? A secret that you didn't want anyone, including us, to find out?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: ...
[The Eighth and Final Rule][March 7th]: Dan Heng, what secret?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: I'm not certain yet... but there's more to our "friend" here than meets the eye.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: You win! I'll help you to the best of my ability — free of charge I might add! But please, don't go spreading rumors about me?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: *sigh* Alright! To prove my sincerity, I'll introduce you to Wildfire. If you're looking for something down here, they're the ones to ask!
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Why should we get to know Wildfire?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Because you are looking for something! Why are you asking? Dan Heng told me you guys were searching for a... what's the word... "Stellaron" — sounded pretty powerful. If anyone has a clue on its whereabouts, it'll be Wildfire.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Dan Heng]: You said I'd uncover a clue if I became the Fight Club champion.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Uhh... Uh, y—yeah! I mean, If you'd fought in the final round and won, you'd have incredible street cred right now! Wildfire wouldn't think twice about talking with you. I don't see the problem.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Why would Wildfire want to help us?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, of course. Wildfire has no reason to help you yet, so we'll just have to give them one! With your talents, we have nothing to worry about.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: I'm telling you, no matter where you go, there's only one rule to getting things done: Find the demand. Y'know, like supply and demand? Anyway, The underground has been sealed off for more than a decade — but do you think people here are just resigned to their fate?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: What kind of organization is Wildfire?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Well if you want my opinion, they're a bunch of artless, stubborn fools. But who cares what I think, huh?
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: They're a band of do-gooders who sprung up to maintain order in the underground. After the Silvermane Guards withdrew, Wildfire set up shop.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Still, don't underestimate them! "We walk in the presence of giants" — have you heard that saying before? Well, Wildfire has giants in its midst. You'll see.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Narration]: Lead the way... and don't try and pull anything this time.
[The Eighth and Final Rule][Sampo]: Have a little faith! It's like I said: "Sampo never lets friends who've helped him come to harm." Hehe...

[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: So... what does Wildfire do all day?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Everything. They keep the peace, uphold justice, fight for resources, distribute goods...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: The sliver of trust they have for me has to do with the last one...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Huh? Where's Joshua?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: What're those shiny rocks?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Ah, this is Geomarrow, an exothermic ore. The underground and the surface are sealed off from one another, right? Well only the Geomarrow transport line is still running. The underground sends ore to the surface, and the surface sends goods to the underground. At least in theory.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Most undergrounders are miners, and this is what they mine for a living. Y'know, if we didn't have Geomarrow to burn, this world would have frozen to death long ago.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Hmm, let's keep moving. The person I was looking for isn't here...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Huh...? Old Oleg isn't here either. Where is everyone? Hehe, hm...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Gah, so you're leading us on another wild goose chase?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: I wouldn't dare! Trust me, we're getting close!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: *sigh* Huh? What's that huge structure in the distance...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Oh, that's the Furnace Core, and it's also the pillar that connects the Underworld and the Overworld. People used to travel up and down that thing, but then...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Then what?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: It's a long story. In any case, practically nothing moves up or down anymore.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Except you.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Oh! C'mon, my dear fellow, I thought we weren't going to discuss this? I beg you, the fewer rumors there are about me, the better!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Seele's usually always out on patrol here at this time...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: What's Wildfire up to...? Hmm... are they avoiding me?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Hey, look! Who is that?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Is that... Bronya?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: She's here too?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: It looks like she's in trouble...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: M—My friends, don't just stand there! This drama really doesn't need any more bystanders!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Oh? Y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: We should avoid attracting too much attention... but we can't just leave her.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Sampo's right, we can't just stand here.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Yeah! Now you're getting it.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Dan Heng's right, we can't ignore this.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Exactly! My boy Cold Dragon Young — uh... young master Dan Heng speaks with reason.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: March is right. Does anyone have popcorn?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Eh, I was kidding, and get your own opinion!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: I agree with Dan Heng, we can't just leave her to the bullies.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Well said! The young lady is wise and righteous!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Let's help her.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Vagrant]: Alright princess. Let's dispense with the pleasantries!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: You dare attack someone on our turf...?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Well? How about a few rounds with me?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Vagrant]: Argh, darn it! Quick, disperse!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Spineless thugs!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Miss Seele! Phew, it's a good thing you showed up when you did. My heartfelt thanks~
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: These vagrants have got some nerve looking for trouble in Wildfire terri—
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Shut it Sampo, this has "you" written all over it. Wildfire has countless issues on its plate right now. We don't need a side order of Koski.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: I hear a Silvermane Guard is paying the Underworld a visit... is that you?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: You kidnapped me and brought me to the underground. What is the meaning of this?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Hmph, listen to her. "What is the meaning of this?" ...She still thinks she's an Overworld princess.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Do you know what's become of us down here while you live the easy life? Did you even consider the fate of the Underworlders?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: The Silvermane Guards aren't "living the easy life." We are constantly engaged with the enemy — defending Belobog from the scourge of attacking monsters... and protecting all those above and below the surface.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Hah, do you even hear yourself? You? Protect the underground? Redeploying every Guard to the surface, sealing off the only passageway... Protecting the so-called Architects, more like it.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: The Madam Guardian has her reasons...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Hmph.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Enough talk, you're coming with me. Chief Oleg wants to see you, and he's got more than a few questions.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Perfect, Miss Seele! We were just on our way to pay Chief Oleg a visit ourselves. Room for a few more?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: Fully booked.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: ...Who are they?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I'm .
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: ...What good is your name by itself!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I'm a friend of Sampo's.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: A friend of his? Then most of the underground is your enemy.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I'm Oleg's guest.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: You know the chief? Then why don't I know you...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Well it's like this: The chief's in the market for specific talent — an urgent request. So, I'm taking them to see him...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: We're looking for a Stellaron — it's the source of all the disasters here. If we find it, we can—
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Ahaha — ahem! I would recommend you not recite your story to everyone you meet. Miss Seele won't understand it anyway, so let's save it for the chief, huh?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: You're right, I don't understand it, and I don't plan on passing the message on either. Wildfire's encountered trouble at the Great Mine — the chief's busy. If you really want to find him, come look for me at the mine entrance.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Seele]: I'm leaving.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: How are you finding your first Trailblazing expedition?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Pretty great, I enjoy a good adventure!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: ...That's good.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I feel a bit discombobulated.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: All journeys contain their share of the unexpected. It won't be the last time.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Trailblazing expedition? Pretty unremarkable.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: ...Sounds like you've taken it in your stride.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: I'm about to summarize the intel we've gathered so far. Did you want to listen?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: That's why I'm here.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: First we have the Underworld — a huge underground space. Miners have built towns here and are excavating Geomarrow.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: What's the relation between here and the Overworld?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: We learned from Natasha that the Underworld shoulders the energy needs of their entire civilization. Laboring in the Underworld used to be a great honor, and there was regular movement between realms.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Sampo mentioned the Furnace Core, which people would use to travel in both directions. Yet now, each realm is sealed off from the other. Only the automatic transport line for Geomarrow and goods is still in operation.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: The reason for sealing the Furnace Core still needs to be investigated. In addition, it appears that Sampo has secret connections that grant him passage between here and the surface. That may come in useful to us.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Do soldiers from the Overworld ever come down here?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Up to now, apart from Bronya, whom Sampo brought here, I still haven't seen a single Silvermane Guard.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: At the Fight Club I heard people say that the Guards withdrew from the underground many years ago, and that it was the supreme guardian who gave the order.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: At the time, the supreme guardian was none other than Cocolia Rand.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I'm clear on this bit. What else?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Next we have our goal — the Stellaron.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: After we revealed our intentions, the supreme guardian suspended communications and sent soldiers to arrest us. Her reaction was strange, to say the least.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Why did the supreme guardian choose to act that way?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: It's too early to say, but it was a radical move. It means that we must have broached a highly sensitive subject... a secret that she's sparing no effort to protect.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: If I remember our discussion correctly, I think there are two main possibilities: The Architects, and the Stellaron. I'm inclined to think it's the latter, but we lack evidence.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Will we find any Stellaron clues in the Underworld?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: There's an old saying that goes: "Good fortune lies within bad, bad fortune lurks within good." Even when compared with the Overworld, the Underworld has a long history. There should be valuable intel here. Not to mention, without the supreme guardian's interference, we have a better chance than ever of locating the Stellaron.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I'm clear on this bit. What else?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Lastly, we have the main strength of the Underworld — Wildfire.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: After the Silvermane Guards withdrew, and in order to keep the peace, the residents of the Underworld spontaneously organized their own militia — thereby taking over the Guards' duties.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Do we need to ally with Wildfire?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Ally? It's a little premature to be talking about that.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: But Wildfire will be familiar with all manner of forces below ground. If we want to find Stellaron clues in the underground, I'm certain they can help.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Do you trust Wildfire?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: I don't know them. Trust isn't part of the picture yet. But speaking of trust, I suggest you don't place too much of yours in Sampo Koski.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: He hasn't revealed his true intentions, but he has managed to corral us into a difficult situation — almost without us realizing. That's a dangerous person indeed.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Well, I'm all up to speed now.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: Mm, that's all we need to summarize for now. If there's anything else you're not clear on, come and find me.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Uhh, maybe next time.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Dan Heng]: No problem, come find me any time.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Oh, hi , wanna listen to my thoughts on the underground?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Sure.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Where should I start?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I want to hear about your observations....
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Ha, my observational skills are second to none.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: How about the Underworld geography?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Well, the Underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. It seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns — just like the outskirts of Belobog.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: There's that huge pillar called the Furnace Core that's always in view — maybe it's some kind of energy hub?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: How about Underworld life?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: From what I've seen, the residents are nearly all miners. It seems like the people here have less than those in the Overworld.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Still, the miners watch fights in their spare time. It's less pretentious than that theater they have on the surface.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: How about the Underworlders?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: They're always in a hurry. The pace of life here is so fast! Things are pretty busy in the Overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: That's all I can think of.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I want to hear what you think about the others...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: I'm not so good at analyzing people, but seeing as you asked...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Sampo?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: That guy!? He's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! I don't like him — can't stand the sight of him.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: I bet you think he's pretty entertaining. Watch out, or he'll fool you!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Hook?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Ah, you mean that naughty kid we played hide-and-seek with?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: Dr. Natasha said that she's a handful, but that she also takes care of the homeless kids. Maybe she's more mature than she seems?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: ...Still, I can't believe how arrogant she is. I was pretty mad with her for a while.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Bronya?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: The Silvermane girl? She's pretty. I like looking at her.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: When I first met her I thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. I'm too nervous to ask her.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: At least she's not trying to arrest us anymore.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Seele?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: She says what she thinks — I like her. And did you hear what she said about the Silvermane Guards? Haha, sounded like she'd been waiting a long time to say it. I think I'd get along with her.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: If we can get her to help us, we'll bag a Stellaron in no time!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: That's all I can think of.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: That's it for now.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: If you hear any juicy gossi— uh... information, come find me!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Not right now.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][March 7th]: No worries, just thought you might be interested.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Bored? Your big brother Sampo's always up for a chat.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Who the heck are you?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: What kind of question is that!? I'm your old pal — Sampo Koski — we've been through thick and thin together!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: You didn't answer the question.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Well, that just means there's something wrong with your question! Questions are like transactions — if your request isn't clear, you might end up buying the wrong thing.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: We haven't been through thick OR thin... pal.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: What do you mean!? We battled wind and snow — fought shoulder to shoulder against the great Gepard Landau! I risked life and limb in the Fragmentum to save you from the evil clutches of the fearsome Bronya Rand!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: How's that for thick and thin?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: My old pal!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Yeah! Haha... Wait, do you mean it?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Who are Wildfire and Seele?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Wildfire are one of my major clients, though the work is mostly odds and ends... Still! It's always a pleasure. Haha, who am I to complain if the money's right, huh?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Seele works for them — Oleg's most trusted lieutenant. *sigh* To her I'm probably just, uh, Wildfire's lapdog.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: Haha! But a very contented lapdog, I should add! Hehe...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: What do Wildfire want?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: As a non-member, not a clue. They'd never tell me their ultimate aims. Shame, really, it's not like I'm a blabbermouth...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Good to chat.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Sampo]: A pleasure! Until next time.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...I will arrest you under the supreme guardian's decree. Nothing has changed.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: I am not your friend...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: It takes time to make friends.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: I like to get close to my enemies.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Please arrest me! I can't wait!
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...There's... something wrong with you.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...I saw you the day before the Goethe Hotel. Gepard took you to see mo— ...the supreme guardian. He told me you were visitors from beyond the sky.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Just like the interstellar travelers of ancient legend — people of all kinds that carried the will of the Aeons.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Gepard said that you wanted to help us reverse the damage that the Eternal Freeze and Fragmentum continue to wreak on our planet... but that night, mother summoned me, and ordered me to take a detachment to arrest you.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: What happened? The supreme guardian didn't tell me the details and Gepard had to rush back to the front line... I don't understand...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: You're not the only one...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: We really do want to help you.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: The supreme guardian betrayed us.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: The Silvermane Guards withdrew to the surface long ago... I must avoid that identity here.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Until we're back in the Overworld, I propose a temporary truce and cooperation. Your true intentions are of interest to me...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: If it helps you to trust me, I'm willing to answer your questions to the best of my ability.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: What crime have we committed?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Let me repeat — all I received were the supreme guardian's instructions. It is for the adjudication panel to pass judgment on the accused.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...All the supreme guardian told me was that your identities were counterfeit, and that your intention was to overthrow the rule of the Architects.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Do you know where the Stellaron is?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Truthfully, I've never heard of this Stellaron.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: But if all this catastrophe could be brought to an end simply by sealing it, then I hope its existence proves to be real.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Why did the Silvermane Guards withdraw from the underground?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Fragmentum monster activity on the surface intensified, and hostilities on the front line were critical. To resist the invasion, the Architects had no choice but to redeploy the Guards to the front line.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: ...If we couldn't hold our defensive line, then we wouldn't be able to maintain our supply of aid to the underground, which would have collapsed without us. That was the supreme guardian's explanation.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: Why are you willing to cooperate with us?
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: In truth... I've always felt like something important is being hidden. Whether it's the Architects, mother, or Silvermane Guards, there's always an... unnatural element to their actions.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Since encountering you, the unexpected seems to have arrived in waves. I never thought I'd enter the Underworld that has been sealed away for so long...
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: I have a feeling that with you, I can pick up the lost threads... and dispel my uncertainties.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Long Wait for the Blade's Edge][Bronya]: Mm, we should be going to see Wildfire. Let's move.

[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hey, you came. That was fast.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What is Wildfire doing in the mine?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What trouble has Wildfire gotten into?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Didn't I tell you? *sigh* Long story short —
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: The underground used to have many mines. However, in recent years, some sort of corrosion called the "Fragmentum" started to spread. It's ruined a lot of mines.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: The one we're heading into is relatively unaffected. A bunch of vagrants made it their home after their old turf was consumed by the Fragmentum. Actually, most of them are pretty honest folks...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: But with such a large group, it's inevitable that troublemakers will find their way in. They've been stealing from the miners and picking fights. And that's not the worst of it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Things are much more serious this time... For two days now, huge clashes have been breaking out between the miners and the vagrants. It isn't pretty.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Mines are our lifelines in the Underworld. We have to keep providing Geomarrow to the Overworld in exchange for supplies.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: In order to quell the situation, Chief Oleg brought Wildfire into the mine and left me in charge of security for the towns. But the situation in the mine is critical — I have to back him up.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: I don't think I understood, can you go over it again?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: The underground used to have many mines. However, in recent years, some sort of corrosion called the "Fragmentum" started to spread. It's ruined a lot of mines.

[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Understood, let's go.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Oh, as for you... the Chief will decide your fate when we see him.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Good, I've been wanting to come face to face with the leader of the Underworld.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hmph, you're about to come face to face with reality.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Huh? Isn't that the doctor lady?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: What's Natasha doing here...? Things must be worse than I thought.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hey, where are you going!? Don't think you can just run off — come back here and finish talking things through with Natasha.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Nat! I didn't think you'd be here. Where's Oleg?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: Hey Seele, and... Sampo's guests. So, it looks like you've already met.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: I haven't seen Oleg. The miners said they saw him take a group further in.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: These people...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: Miners and their family members. They want an explanation from the instigators.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: This area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. I guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: *sigh* I heard that many were injured in the clashes, so I hurried over here to see if I could help.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What are you doing here?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: I heard that the miners had been having violent clashes with local thugs, with significant numbers of wounded. I hurried over to see if I could help.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: You see these people? They're all miners and their family members. They want an explanation from the instigators.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: This area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. I guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: I'm not feeling too good...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: Oh? You look fine to me. Sorry, I need to prioritize the wounded. There have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days — many people are injured.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: You see these people? They're all miners and their family members. They want an explanation from the instigators.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: This area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. I guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: How could the situation here become such a mess?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: I heard that First Mining Team found a Geomarrow vein with incredible deposits... The initial estimate put it at the largest discovery in the last thirty years.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Are you serious? That's big news. How come I never heard about it?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: Well, they weren't in a hurry to make it known. Most of the mines have been contaminated by the Fragmentum — many people are out of work. They were afraid of being overwhelmed if they let the word out.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: But the vagrants here have keen eyes — they couldn't keep it hidden from them. Some local gangs wanted to profit from the situation, so they blackmailed the mining team for hush money... and that was the final straw.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: That's the price of guarding a secret.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: *sigh* ...I can understand your thinking. It's just that the underground is in difficult straits...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: The vein should belong to those who discovered it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: As it happens, that's exactly the law we have down here. But the vagrants have their own custom: See it, share it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: And that's how the clash started. Now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: So, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: They're here because they need a favor from Chief Oleg. I'm escorting them.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: And seeing as you need that helping hand, it wouldn't be too much to ask you to lend one here first, right?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Of course we wanna help... we care about other people too y'know.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: We came here willing to help out.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Oh... that's quite nice of you.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Sounds like a fair trade off.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hmph, of course it is. Nobody gives without expecting something in return.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Not interested, sorry.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Suit yourself. I'm not forcing you.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: Haha, I believe we're dealing with kind-hearted people here, Seele.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Natasha]: As you've all seen, the situation down here is... strained. If you can, we really would appreciate you helping the people.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: ,  and  Musketeer's Coarse Leather Gloves ×1 )
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bullheaded Vagrant]: Don't come any closer! The road's blocked — stay where you are!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Anxious Miner]: ...Whoa, easy! Why are you hiding in there? Don't you know what happened in the mine?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bullheaded Vagrant]: What's that got to do with us? Do you think we're the same as those thugs?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Anxious Miner]: Is anyone with you injured? We have a doctor. She can care for your wounded!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bullheaded Vagrant]: Yeah right, and you can guarantee that no one there with you is out for blood? I don't believe it. Stay where you are!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Anxious Miner]: *sigh* These guys...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Complaining Miner]: I told Antonia from the beginning: We never should have let those vagrants mine with us. I wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for those thugs.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Upright Miner]: Enough already. Nobody has it easy — this is a time to help each other out.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Upright Miner]: I remember one of your uncles had to flee Rivet Town, which makes him a vagrant too, right? Would you drive him away?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Complaining Miner]: ...He's family. The other vagrants aren't my problem.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Worried Wife]: Have any of you seen my husband? He's a good-looking guy — tall and thin...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Wildfire Member Caring for the Injured]: You again? Quit joking around! No need to add to the confusion.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Worried Wife]: *sigh* You think I'm joking? I saw you taking down the names of the miners — that's why I came over.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Wildfire Member Caring for the Injured]: Oh... You can put the name down here.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Concerned Miner]: Peak... he's done for. He was asleep in there.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Exhausted Miner]: Easy, Dr. Natasha told you to rest. What if your wound opens up again? Besides, Elaine will get him out, she's a reliable girl.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Concerned Miner]: Elaine was in there too!? Quick, we have to—
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Exhausted Miner]: Calm down and stop worrying. Wildfire's already gone in.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: The giant ore vein — the one they discovered... That must be where the clashes are centered?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Come on, let's get to higher ground and take a look.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: That person up ahead... is he asleep?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Let's head up and take a look, he might need help.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Hey! There are still wounded here that need our help!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: ...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Falling asleep in a place like this... impressive!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Hey, wakey-wakey! You'll get mushrooms growing on your head~
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: Hm...? Wha...? Mushroom bread...? I can't see it on the menu... Miss Seele?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Have you got a death wish or something? How can you sleep here? Get back to safety and take shelter!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: Take shelter... *gasp* I remember now! These guys came out of nowhere and got into a fight with the mining team...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: At the time I was exhausted — I'd hardly run a few feet when one of them caught me. If it weren't for Wildfire, they'd have stolen the clothes off my back!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: And then? Where did Wildfire go?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: Further in, I guess. Those thugs took control of the vein ages ago — and they're fully armed. We poor, defenseless, good folks were no match for them.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: It's only thanks to Wildfire that the Great Mine hasn't fallen into their hands completely.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: ...They'd take your clothes? These ones?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: You don't know these guys — no moral compass — they'd rob you blind in a flash! It's only thanks to Wildfire that the Great Mine hasn't fallen under their control completely.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: Uh... speaking of which... where is Wildfire? Did they head further in? Is there a fight happening?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: ...It seems like Chief Oleg must be up ahead. Hurry up and get back to safety — look for Nat. And try not to get into another scrap along the way.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Peak]: Okay! Thank you for, um... getting me on my feet! If I get back soon enough, I'll have time for a nap...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: I recognize that woman — that's Elaine from First Mining Team! Quick, let's get up there and see if she's wounded.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Elaine! Are you okay? Are you hurt?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: Seele! Thank goodness. I—I'm fine, just a couple of sprains.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: You've got good timing — those vagrants were asking me about the robots, but I don't know anything...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Robots?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Doesn't ring a bell...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: Oh! Don't you know? The inner section of the Great Mine has been seized by a band of robots! Neither the mining team nor the vagrants can get anywhere near.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: New challengers enter! About time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: Does anyone know where the robots come from?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: At first, we thought that a collective fault had occurred in the excavation machines, but then we found out that those machines didn't even belong to the mining team.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: They came out of nowhere and pushed the vagrants and us back. Then they blocked off the only tunnels into the inner section.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Maybe someone's playing tricks?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: Hehe, there's no way anyone in the mining team is behind this... Operating a single unit is tiring enough, but a whole group? Hehe, Impossible.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Then there's only one possibility... Boss Svarog.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Svarog? That name sounds familiar...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: You remember the robots we defeated in the boxing gym?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Oh! Boss Svarog's robots! What's his deal?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Let's just say he's not to be trifled with. Let's go and find some other people. Elaine, can you make it back to safety?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Elaine]: No problem. Seele, and the rest of you — be careful...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Robots aligned against humans? I've never heard of such a thing. Machines should obey humans unconditionally...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: That's not the only thing you won't have heard of down here, princess.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dense Vagrant]: Is this elevator b—broken? Why isn't it r—responding?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Restless Vagrant]: Why are you worried about this piece of junk? Do you really wanna go down there and be a live target for the robots?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dense Vagrant]: But, i—if we evacuate, then haven't we lost out?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Restless Vagrant]: You idiot — we'll just steal off the miners! Look, I saw with my own eyes — they managed to bag some Geomarrow. This is a perfect opportunity.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dense Vagrant]: Oh, g—good idea!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Shameless. Still after the miners, are you? Time to teach you a lesson.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hmph, fleeing at the first sign of danger... that's all they're good for.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Huh? What's this... Did those guys leave it behind...?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Wh—Whoa!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: What the heck!?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][???]: Beep, beep, beep... Searching for potential user...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][???]: Beep, beep, beep... Voiceprint detected. Looking up corresponding identity information... Oh my, it's an alien.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Hey, it talks! And it knows that we aren't from this planet?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: It doesn't seem to be technology from here. Look — it even has an Interastral Peace Corporation logo on it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: Perhaps it's an antiquity left behind by some past interstellar traveler.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][???]: Beep, beep, beep... Your mom's an antiquity!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][???]: Beep, beep, beep... Whatever, whatever. So you aliens know about the Interastral Peace Corporation? That's great.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Self introduction: I am Richard, the Home-Use Object Finder. Model information: Version 0.63, Professional model, Annual Deluxe package. Nickname: "Findie."
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: A Home-Use Object Finder? Who knew the IPC made these kinds of products...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... My brainwave scanner module is damaged. Please send me to an Interastral Peace Appliances retail store near you for free repair within the warranty period of 232 years 84 days.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Alien, please take me to an Interastral Peace Appliances retail store to conduct repairs—
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: What!? This fella's already broken... What should we do, take it with us?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Let's take it. Maybe it could be of some use.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Yes, yes, yes. When you need to find something you can't see, just call upon Findie. That's me.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: My inventory is already maxed out...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Ugh, you need to log out once in a while.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: Let's take it with us. It doesn't take up much room. And if it really is broken, there are trashcans everywhere.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Not a trashcan! Yes, yes, yes. When you need to find something you can't see, just call upon Findie. That's me.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Hey, what's that commotion? It sounds like there's a big argument happening...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Let's get closer and take a look.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: ...Cowards and bullies. I don't remember you guys acting this tough around Svarog's minions. Did your parents never teach you what a backbone was?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Vagrant]: Pff! We ain't stupid! Why would we risk our lives against the robots? And get off the high road — you can't just find a huge chunk of Geomarrow and hog it all to yourselves!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: This mine is our territory — the mining team is laboring here day in and day out. You guys don't even pretend like you're here to lend a hand!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: You're lazy. All you want is to profit off of our sweat and tears. And you don't even try hiding it! ...Disgraceful.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Vagrant]: Where does disgrace come into it when we can't even fill our stomachs, huh!? I know your game — you're just waiting for us to starve to death, so there's more food for your mining team.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: ...It's a waste of time trying to reason with you. While you've been kicking up this fuss, the whole vein's been seized by robots. Now we're all in the same boat.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Vagrant]: Hehe, right, right... we can't rely on the vein anymore... But don't forget which side brought loaded guns to the party.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Whoa, easy, wh—what are you trying to pull off? I—I'm warning you, Wildfire are in the area...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Vagrant]: Haha, empty threat! Wildfire are stuck dealing with Svarog's minions — how are they gonna help you now? Unless you're planning on taking a bullet, hand over the supplies and equipment!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: They're getting ready to attack! Those miners are unarmed.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: You shameless scoundrels...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Let's save them!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Stay calm...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: You stay calm if you want. I'm taking action! I know those people!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Leave it to me.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: No need to play the hero, I'm going with you!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: I'm going too. We can't let these thugs get away with whatever they like!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Thug]: Aha, and who do we have here? Do you know whose territory this is!?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Shut it, this isn't your territory. I'm in a hurry — I'll take you all in one go!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Seele! Thank goodness you came. We were nearly...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Nothing but a few knuckleheads. I'm just glad you're okay. Antonia, have you seen Chief Oleg?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Oleg? He took a group into the inner section. Said it was to clear off the invading robots.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: They've been gone for a while now. Hmph, if Wildfire was around, those thugs wouldn't have dared.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Seems like the core of this problem is Svarog's robots...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What do those robots want?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Your run-of-the-mill robots don't have a will of their own. Their aim is merely Svarog's aim.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: We need to talk about this "boss..."
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: The boss... He appeared suddenly after the Guards were redeployed, and became a major player in the Underworld.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Svarog claims to be a guardian of humanity — all the ownerless robots obey his commands. They've occupied the furnace core hub, and they're not letting anyone get close.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Nobody knows why Svarog did any of this... He usually doesn't leave the Furnace Core and interfere unless some kind of disorder breaks out in the Underworld.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: ...A "guardian of humanity" that can... command robots? I've never heard of anything like...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hmph, looks like your mighty Architects weren't as all-knowing as you thought.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Can you two say anything without quarreling? This isn't the time! It sounds like there's danger waiting for us in the inner section, can we still get through?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: I want to meet Svarog and his minions.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Right, there's unfinished business here — the chief is still down there. It's only a bunch of scrap metal. What are we afraid of?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: We saved the miners, let's go back.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Easy for you to say. This isn't over — the chief and the others are still down there. It's only a bunch of scrap metal. What are we afraid of?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: We haven't found Wildfire yet.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Yeah, you still need to talk with the chief. It's only a bunch of scrap metal. What are we afraid of?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Ohh~ Is Seele starting to appreciate our strength? Hmm?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: I'll be honest, you guys are hardworking. If everyone from Wildfire were as impressive as you on the battlefield, we wouldn't be so hard-pressed by Svarog.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Antonia, can you take the mining team back through the entrance to meet up with Natasha?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Sure thing, but be careful! There are a lot of robots up ahead!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: What kind of days are we living through...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What else do you know about Svarog?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Svarog? I don't know much. The underground is in turmoil, everyone's focused on their own issues. Who has time to get involved in someone else's affairs?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: I heard the vagrants say Svarog was protecting their base near the Furnace Core. Tsk, and there I was thinking he was one of the good guys.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Did you bring those vagrants into the mine?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Huh? What are you trying to say — that it's my fault?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You misunderstand.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: No need to get excited.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Forget it, I'm just tired, that's all.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: Even if those vagrants have no home to return to, they still have their dignity. They won't accept charity forever.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: They needed honest work to get them through this hardship. So, I let them join the mining team. Can anyone really say I did wrong?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You did right, but maybe that's how the problem started.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: The problem started with them leaving home and being dependent on charity... If you want something to blame, blame life in the Underworld.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Maybe you could have handled it better.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: *sigh* When it boils down to it, they only chose to form a clique because the other miners never truly accepted them... I should've seen it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You seem to be familiar with Wildfire.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: They're a reliable group. Trust me, if we didn't have them, this area would be packed with monsters already. Just like Rivet Town.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Antonia]: I'm about to take the mining team over to Dr. Natasha. Take care of yourselves.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Is this the right way? It looks like there's a roadblock up ahead.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: ...I'll be the judge of that. Come on, let's take a closer look.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: It's completely blocked by the mine cart... What do we do? Can we blow it up?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Easy! It belongs to the mining team. We can't just destroy it. We should try and fix it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Easier said than done... Do you know how?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Yeah, of course, every Underworlder worth their salt knows how to fix a mine cart. Let me see...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: ...Hmm. Even the pin connecting the body to the chassis is broken, not to mention the rear wheelset bearing. This looks like the work of Svarog's minions.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Come on, we passed a lot of discarded mine carts on the way over, let's see if there are any components we can recycle.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: We need to find spare parts we can use nearby. Argh, we're wasting time...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Friends, do you need to find something? Findie can help.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: ...How come you just jumped out on your own, little fella? Isn't your module thingy broken?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... My brainwave scanner module is indeed broken. However, manual input for search is still operable.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Come on. Input the name of the object you are looking for. Findie can help.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Oh, well aren't you confident? Let me give it a try then.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Where's the input interface? Ah, found it...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Mine Cart Pin... Mine Cart Wheelset... Confirm... Just like that?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Request is being processed...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Match successful... Initiating search for lost item: Mine Cart Pin...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep! Item found. Please commence search according to the Home-Use Object Finder Safety Manual.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Let me see... Yeah, we can make do with this part. This little machine isn't half bad.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... What's that? Is that a hint of respect for Findie?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: How convenient! So next time Dan Heng gets lost, we can just use Findie to find him, right?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Biological life form search is currently not supported. If you have any questions, please call Interastral Peace Appliances.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: ...Well, it was a good idea. Let's look for the next part.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Initiating search for lost item: Mine Cart Wheelset...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep! Item found. Please commence search according to the Home-Use Object Finder Safety Manual.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: That's everything!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: You were a big help, Findie!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... It was nothing. Interastral Peace Appliances, your most trustworthy companion.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Findie]: Beep, beep, beep... Current search complete. *yawn* Entering sleep mode. Please recharge the Home-Use Object Finder.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: ...We're pretty lucky, huh? Without Findie, it probably would've taken half the day to find these parts.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Well, not that long... But that little machine definitely made it a lot easier. Alright, let's go back and fix the mine cart.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Are you gonna do it yourself?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Why wouldn't I? You've gotta be self-reliant down here. Watch, you might learn something.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You all fix the mine cart together...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Alright, mission accomplished!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hmph, quick work. Y'know, I didn't think you guys had worked a day in your lives, but you know how to get your hands dirty.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: The cart is about to depart!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: The robots will have seized the road ahead by now. We should go carefully.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Whoa! Stop! Ah! Stop, stop, stop! There's a big evil hunk of metal right there!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: That model... it's one of Svarog's lapdogs alright.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Don't be afraid, I've dealt with those robots before. Let's go!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Seeing it up close... this vein's even more spectacular.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: I doubt the underground will ever see it fully excavated...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: ...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: This vein... So this is what everyone is fighting over...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: Mr. Svarog, it's such a massive vein. I've never seen so much Geomarrow before...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: Calculating... Based on the average rate of excavation, this vein is enough to supply Belobog with 231 days of energy, with a margin of error of 7 days.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: I sense that your reason for summoning me is not the ore in question. State your true intention, Clara.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: ...Right. I wanted Mr. Svarog to see that many miners and vagrants have gotten hurt because of the vein... Can you help them?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: I have already prevented the dispute and taken temporary control of the excavation zone. Evaluation result: In the event of no further variables, there will be no large-scale armed conflict within the next 30 days.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: I know why you did it, Mr. Svarog! It's just... I don't think it'll be enough.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: The mining team and Wildfire... they don't understand your actions... If only we could do more for them...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: My mission is the protection of the Underworld. The trust of the minority sample is redundant to my calculations.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: Human behavior will always deviate from rational calculation, Clara...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: As evidenced by their presence here.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Svarog! We haven't settled our final score.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: Seele, subordinate to Wildfire... Your resistance is futile. The result of my calculation is unequivocal: Remaining in the Underworld is the optimal strategy for survival.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: *sigh* This again... Calculation results, survival strategies... I haven't got time for your thesis. Withdraw your forces, or I'll lose my temper!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: Observe, Clara. Even under abject conditions, humans are unable to avoid division and conflict.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: But, Mr. Svarog...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: Human failure to accept the calculation result is a significant threat to the survival strategy of the Underworld. Calculation complete, result unequivocal: Armed suppression of Wildfire and their allies is the optimal course of action.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: This guy looks stronger than the other robots...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: And more fashionably dressed, too... Hey, is he about to leave? What about the girl in red?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: His robots don't seem too friendly...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Ah! What about the girl in red? That robot is gonna take her away!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Svarog]: We must leave, Clara. External variables have triggered a calculation reset. The Furnace Core hub requires protection.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Clara]: ...Please, Mills, don't hit them too hard.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: *sigh* I was getting bored of those minions — time for a real fight. Come at me!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Whew... not bad. How many of these big guys is Svarog hiding?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: A lot... which is why Wildfire has never been able to take him down. Svarog's forces are too strong. We don't have enough firepower.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: That girl in red...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Clara? Don't worry about her. That girl is best pals with Svarog — she's always following behind him. He wouldn't harm her.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Why did Svarog leave?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Like I told you. That guy barely leaves his nest — it's rare to see him away from the Furnace Core. Even when he does appear, he doesn't stick around for long. He leaves everything to his subordinates.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: It might also have been because Clara was here — the little girl in red. She's best pals with Svarog — always following behind him.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: I guess I'm just used to seeing them together now, even if I don't understand it. *sigh* Let's look for the chief.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: No need to look far.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Nice work, Seele. We were attacked on both sides by robots — who knows where they came from. We thought we were in it for the long haul, hahaha!
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Chief! Is everyone okay? Is anyone injured?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: We're fine — we're used to it at this point. We sent those pesky robots and ragtag troops packing. The mine should be quiet for a while.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: And who are your friends here...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Ahh, them! They're outsiders that Sampo brought down from who-knows-where. They need a favor from Wildfire, so I brought them with me. It'll be faster if they explain.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Are you the chief? You're a hard man to find.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Hahaha! That's quite the tone to take on our first meeting. I won't forget you in a hurry.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Pleased to meet you. We're here to make friends with Wildfire.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Hah, it's been a while since I heard that anyone was pleased to meet anyone, haha. I won't forget you in a hurry. Wildfire welcomes you.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: So, you went to all this trouble to find Wildfire. What help is it you need?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Telling Oleg and Seele about what happened and your mission to look for the Stellaron...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Ha! I didn't know you'd put on a show for the Overworld too. Impressive.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Ho-ho, well this is new. Wildfire can barely take care of the Underworld, and now outsiders are looking for assistance from us.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: This "Stellaron" you speak of — I've never heard of it. But if it's a secret that even we locals don't know about, then one name does come to mind...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: ...Do you mean Cocolia?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: ...Do you mean Sampo?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Really? Sampo? You might as well try the supreme guardian.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: The current supreme guardian is a liar who uses sweet words to deceive the Underworld. She's never cared about our survival—
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Stop right there... I... won't allow you to insult the madam guardian.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Miss Overworld, my words may be painful to you, but every one of them is true. Go out into the towns and hear for yourself — see how the people here suffer.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: ...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: I haven't gotten close to voicing the extent of the Underworld's grievances, young lady. But I will respect your request. I will leave it at that, for now.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Let's get back to the main topic. The name that came to my mind, was Svarog.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Huh...!? Isn't Svarog Wildfire's sworn enemy?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: Why would a mere robot in the Underworld have knowledge of important secrets?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Sworn enemy? Not how I see it. The young master here is closer. Svarog is a cold and unfeeling machine. He recognizes only the dead reasoning of his calculations.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Svarog is not against Wildfire... or perhaps I should say: Wildfire isn't even of concern to him. That ancient robot witnessed the war...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: If you're looking to pick up a thread... he may well be your best source.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Is he really that old? He looks pretty new.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Don't judge a book by its cover. I myself have put a few centuries behind me. Would you be able to tell?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: I'm familiar with over twenty long-life species — none of them look like you.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Hey! Would it kill you to play along?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You mean the war with the Antimatter Legion?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Yeah, I remember hearing this world was invaded by the Legion hundreds of years ago.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Robots don't forget. If Svarog hasn't heard of your Stellaron, then I'm afraid perhaps no one has.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: In which case, we need to think of a way to convince Svarog to communicate with us.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Or get him to hand over his memory bank. We could go through it ourselves.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Dan Heng]: What should we do...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: We've tried repeatedly to negotiate with Svarog, but he rejects every effort. He believes that Wildfire is a threat. Still, if it were you guys...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Hmm... It's difficult to say.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: ...We have time. Let's get into the detail tomorrow. It's late, and you must've been through a lot. Go back to the town and rest. I'll make arrangements.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][March 7th]: Again? I'm starting to get nervous of "arranged rest" on this planet...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: As for our Silvermane girl here... do you have time? I'd like to talk with you in private.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Wildfire, the vagrants, Svarog... The changes in here are greater than I ever imagined. *sigh* What exactly did the Underworld go through after the Silvermane Guards left?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: ...Sorry, did you have something you wanted to say to me?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What do you think Oleg wants to talk about?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: I think I know what it will concern. Even if Oleg wasn't looking for me, I would've looked for him.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: I'm certain that the residents of the underground will have a lot they need to vent about. And as a Silvermane Guard, I have a lot that I need to ascertain. Nothing more.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What do you think of this Boss Svarog?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: According to Oleg, he's a robot that took part in the War of Defense over seven hundred years ago. He possesses a near-human intelligence, and rules over all the machinery in the underground...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: During the war, the Architects created astonishing mechanical soldiers, but the fight was so terrible that most were damaged or destroyed. The technology was lost.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: ...If what Oleg says is true, then Svarog is an Architect creation leftover from the Old Era.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You and Seele work well together.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: We do? I hadn't realized. I've received rigorous military training — coordinating with soldiers under any circumstances is easy for me...
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You can say what you mean.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: So it's really only the training?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: I admit, Seele is talented. We... do work well together. But that's all there is to it.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Bronya]: Hey... Thanks for your concern. You should head back to the town, and... I'll do the same when Oleg and I are finished.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Ah, young . This isn't the best place for a chat. Let's keep things brief.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What's so great about Svarog?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Svarog? He's an artificially intelligent being from the Old World. He was here when the underground was first constructed. That's about all I know.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Now he guards the Furnace Core hub. Many vagrants have established bases in the vicinity, seeking Svarog's protection.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What happened in the mine?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: You got the gist from Natasha, right? The miners and vagrants came to blows over the vein, then Svarog's subordinates pushed everyone back.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Just pushed them back?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Well, perhaps their methods were lacking in finesse, but that's essentially what they did.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: So Svarog wasn't after the vein?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: You saw for yourself — after he pushed everyone back, he disappeared. It was clear: He didn't have any interest in the vein itself.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: If you want my take, he prevented another Underworld conflict, even if the execution was rough around the edges.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: His behavior says something about his thinking: "As long as everyone's been driven out, the conflict is over."
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: What do you want to say to Bronya?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Well, I heard that she's a Silvermane Guard that was sent to arrest you. I expected you to be less friendly around each other... Are you worried about her?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: We're working together now.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Oh, working together? Understood. Rest easy, I won't make things difficult for her.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Don't threaten her.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Hahahaha, you needn't worry! That Silvermane girl wouldn't be afraid of an old veteran anyway.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Very much so.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: Really? I'm surprised. Still, you can rest easy, I won't make things difficult for her.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: We haven't seen a Silvermane Guard down here for a long time now. I just wanna ask her a few questions, nothing more.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: I've nothing to ask.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Oleg]: It's getting late. You should go back to the town and get some rest.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: You guys have some moves. If you need my help with anything, just shout.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: So you finally believe us?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Hmph, it'll take more than that. But you're not as bad as I took you for. You walk the talk.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: We need your help.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Huh, couldn't even give it a minute, could you?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: I've been on my feet all day. I don't have the energy for more headaches right now. Let me catch my breath and I'll come find you tomorrow.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Oh, I wanted to ask you — that Bronya girl... Is she really a Silvermane Guard?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: Yes, she's their leader.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Oh? She heads up the force? Hm... Not bad.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Narration]: You don't think she's got the talent?
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: No, no, she's got skill alright, I can tell she's got training.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: It's just... I thought that Silvermane Guards were all cold and unfeeling — they left the Underworld to perish. But she... doesn't give me that impression.
[Ones Fallen into the Abyss][Seele]: Anyway, I've got stuff to report to the chief. See you around.

[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: Oh, you must be Oleg's guests? Welcome to the Goethe Grand Hotel.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Goethe...?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: Yep, you've probably seen that stylish Goethe Hotel above ground, right?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Uhh, not the most pleasant memories of that place...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: That's the above-ground branch of the Grand Hotel. A few hundred years ago, one ancestor of the Goethe family was ambitious, and sought to build something big from nothin'.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: He eventually realized his dream and opened a hotel branch in the most expensive area on the surface.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Grand Hotel...?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Hey, that's not very polite~
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: Hahaha, it's fine. You aren't the first guest to have that reaction.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: A few hundred years ago, one ancestor of the Goethe family was ambitious, and sought to build something big from nothin'. Eventually, he actually did it.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: Have you seen that stylish Goethe Hotel? Strictly speaking, it's a branch of this Grand Hotel.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: ...People with big dreams have big determination.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Gertie]: Oleg wants me to take good care of y'all. Here's the key, you'll be stayin' in our most spacious guest room.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: What do you think, ? Should we go ahead and call it a day, or walk around a bit more first?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: I'm tired. Let's go back to the room to rest.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Let's go explore the town a bit more.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Rest
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: What do you think, ? Should we go ahead and call it a day, or walk around a bit more first?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Time to rest again. I hope there aren't any surprises this time.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: That Oleg... he seems sincere. What do you guys think?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: I think he's a good person.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Don't you have something cool to say, like "Appearances can be deceiving"?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: I don't try to disagree.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Appearances can be deceiving.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: *sigh* Happy now?  is even starting to sound like you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: It has nothing to do with me.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: No comment.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Would you look at , blurting out something so irresponsible.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: A lot like you, actually.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: But if you ask for my opinion, it's better to be safe than sorry.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Fine, we'll keep our guards up. Our last hotel experience was eventful, to say the least.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: One of us should keep watch tonight.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: K—Keep watch? Are we space cowboys now? I guess this is the cosmic wild west.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Hehe... *pretend yawn* Anyone else sleepy...?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: March looks the most awake.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: N—No I don't! *pretend yawn* Besides, I've never pulled an all-nighter before! Do you know how bad it is for your skin?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: How about you set us a good example, Dan Heng?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: Sure. I don't have much need for sleep.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Leave it to me.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Dan Heng]: You seem pretty exhausted, don't overexert yourself. I'll do it.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I'll keep watch.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: Bronya, did you finish talking to Oleg? Hope he didn't make things difficult for you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Not really, though it wasn't the friendliest conversation. We didn't see eye to eye on everything.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I've come to know a great deal in a short time — I doubt I'll be able to fall asleep tonight.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][March 7th]: I doubt I'll be able to sleep either... not that I don't trust you! It's just... you're a Silvermane Guard officer in the underground. There might be people looking to harm you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I wouldn't be surprised if there are... the Silvermane Guards have a lot to make amends for down here.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: If someone had made a stand in the outset... and explained the consequences to Madam Cocolia... Forget it. It's meaningless to talk about it now.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: You don't need to worry about me. Oleg guaranteed that I wouldn't be harmed. He seemed like a man of his word. Go and rest.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Cocolia]: I lost her... My wish, your so-called plan... What is the point of it all?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][???]: Your grief... sorrow... useless sentiments... abandon them all...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Cocolia]: Silence! She is my daughter, my only...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Cocolia]: You soulless thing — how could you begin to fathom!? You will never understand... Never!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][???]: You did not lose her... She waits to be reunited with you on the other side.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Cocolia]: A new world...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][???]: Rise... guardian...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][???]: Fulfill your destiny... Fulfill a mother's wish.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: :
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: :
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Who goes there? Show yourself!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: ...It's you. Don't sneak up behind me next time. Lucky for you I wasn't armed.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: No sleep for you either, huh?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: I've been having nightmares recently.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I understand. The more that weighs on your mind, the more your fears become dreamscapes.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: I'm worried about the future.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I know what you mean. I don't like the feeling that I'm not in control. And now...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: I can't sleep unless I've worked for eight hours.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: ...You need someone to look after you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Actually, seeing as there's no one around... can I ask you some things?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: This Stellaron you speak of... if you were to find it, how sure are you that you could stop the Eternal Freeze?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: 100%!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Your confidence actually makes me even more worried... This isn't like helping a child make a snowball.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: I don't know.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I see... Well, thank you for being sincere. In itself, it's a comfort to me.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: You'd better ask Dan Heng.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Is he your leader? I feel he possesses a great stillness of mind in everything he does.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: You know, it was difficult for me to believe you. Some of the words you use are too alien for those that have lived their entire life in Belobog.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: As far as I was concerned, Madam Cocolia's order to arrest you sounded reasonable... but why didn't she issue it straight away?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: She must have realized something about you... Something I haven't yet been able to perceive for myself, and it bothers me...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: What must have transpired to cause her such a drastic change? ...Still, orders are orders. It's not for soldiers to question their superiors.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: You had no choice.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I don't need you to absolve me. The truth is, I didn't have every confidence that I was doing the right thing, but the sense of duty to carry out an order is bound to prevail with me.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Only a fool follows orders blindly.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I don't need you to remind me, and I didn't have every confidence that I was doing the right thing. But the sense of duty to carry out an order is bound to prevail with me.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: In the past, Overworld soldiers on the front line would lose their lives in droves, and yet the Fragmentum's advance would remain unaffected.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Nevertheless, that was her reason for deploying all the Silvermane Guards to the front line. The transport line for supplies and Geomarrow remained open, but the passage between the surface and the underground ceased. I approved of that decision...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I never thought that the Underworld would sink into such ruin without the Silvermane Guards... Perhaps mother was wrong...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: But how can I change her mind? I've tried, but she won't listen. I don't know how to get through to her...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: We'll help you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Help me change the mind of the Madam Guardian? Not easy. Nobody knows that better than I do.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: You should become the supreme guardian.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: You mean...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: ...What was I thinking!? No... I shouldn't... That was a diabolical thought!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: The more I think about it, the more disoriented I get, which in turn makes me think about it even more... I just want a better life for the people of Belobog...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: The world is more complicated than you think.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Let's work together, maybe we can make a change.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: You can't save the world alone.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: ...Maybe you're right, or not. Right now I just... need more time to think.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Walk with me. Let's forget our problems for a while.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I can't remember the last time I went for a walk like this. I never thought I'd take one through such a strange place, with someone I'd only just gotten to know.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: It's so quiet here I'm not used to it... *sigh* The quieter things are around you, the louder they are in your head.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: I'm surprised the vagrants in the Great Mine go after the mining teams, they must be desperate.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Still, whatever their situation, a crime is a crime. *sigh* How is the law supposed to find a balance between justice and compassion in the face of such complexity...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: ...How much longer can you last with your current supplies?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Is that... Seele?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: , let's go take a look.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: ...I know. I'll go to Rivet Town and bring them back for you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: It's too dangerous to go alone. Get Oleg to send someone with you.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: The rest of Wildfire has barely gotten any sleep the last few days. They should rest. They'd only be holding their eyelids open and slowing me down.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: Besides, didn't you say some of the miners were gravely injured? Lives are on the line...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Is there trouble?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Sounds like we arrived just on time.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: Aren't you supposed to be sleeping? What are you doing out here?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: ...Up to no good, perhaps?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: We're just having a walk. Neither of us could sleep. You can rescind your baseless accusations.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: Hmph. Walk somewhere else, then...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Easy, Seele, maybe they can help.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Always willing to help Miss Natasha.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Haha, I'm grateful.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: We're not helping anyone with a temper like that.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Hey, come on now, Seele's got a sharp tongue but a soft heart. She didn't mean anything.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: No problem. We'll help with anything.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Haha, oh yeah? Well look at you swaggering in like the protagonist in your own story.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Here's the situation: The clinic is packed full of people injured in the mines incident. Since you helped us resolve things, Seele and I have been busy caring for them.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: As you know, the underground is lacking resources to begin with. Add on the sudden nature of the incident, and it's no surprise that the clinic is almost out of medical supplies. We need to acquire more... somehow.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Are there other towns in the underground?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: *sigh* The situation in other towns is even worse than ours.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Get Sampo to acquire some?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: You don't know him at all yet, do you? You can't rely on people like Sampo when it's important.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: As the Fragmentum spreads underground, more monsters go roaming around causing trouble for all the towns. That means more vagrants in the mines.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: The towns' resources have been swallowed up by the Fragmentum. To get anything now, people have to risk their lives!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: ...Easy now, Seele. Anger isn't good for one's health.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Seele and I actually aren't from here. We both come from an industrial town to the north. A few years ago, the Fragmentum began to seep into the town center.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: I used to manage an orphanage and clinic there, but after the Fragmentum corroded the area, I had no choice but to move here to Boulder Town. After all, I have to survive myself if I want to save more people.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: Go to a corroded town to collect some useful resources? I'm in.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: We'll help, too.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: Alright, what's the plan?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Narration]: How come you catch on this quick!?
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: You want to come as well? But you look quite tired.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: Hold up! I never said you could join us!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Bronya]: People's lives are at stake. Why wouldn't you want another person to help? Besides, I have some experience with the Fragmentums. I'm sure I will be of use.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: *sigh* Well... just don't slow me down!
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: —Seele's lack of outright rejection means she approves of you, hehe. With you all accompanying her, my mind will be more at ease.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Come. Let me give you a list of materials we need.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: The place you are going to is called Rivet Town. Follow the path through the mountains to the north for a bit and you'll arrive there.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Let me think... I'm almost out of metal plates and bandages used for immobilizing broken bones. There's a market in the center of Rivet Town. Residents left behind piles of materials there when they evacuated. Please look for some there...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: Oh! Also, rubbing alcohol. I kept a bunch at the orphanage, since the kids often got into tussles. I didn't bring it with me when I left... I hope it's still intact.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: ...Lastly, painkillers. There should be a bunch stored in the old lab. Hopefully they haven't been destroyed by monsters...
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Natasha]: These should be enough to get by for a bit longer. Be careful. Don't push yourselves too hard.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: Metal plates and bandages, rubbing alcohol, and painkillers... Got it, piece of cake.
[A Sunset Rendezvous][Seele]: Let's go, if we leave now we can still make it back before sundown. When it comes to helping injured people groaning in pain, the sooner the better.

[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: If we hadn't happened to be passing by... were you really planning to go into the Fragmentum alone?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Of course. What's all the fuss about? I've done that loads of times.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: So reckless... According to the rules of the Silvermane Guards, any expedition into the Fragmentum must have a squad of at least four members, as well as a communications officer.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Exactly, a rule of the Silvermane Guards. Don't apply your rules to us.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Natasha]: Thank you, . If we hadn't run into you two, Seele would've had to venture into the Fragmentum on her own.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Natasha]: I know it's not her first rodeo, but the thought of her taking on those horrid monsters... I can't help but worry.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: You seem to care about her a lot.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Natasha]: Well, she grew up before my eyes after all. I don't want anything bad to happen to her.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I think she can handle it.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Natasha]: I know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. I don't want anything bad to happen to her.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Natasha]: Seele has been like this since she was little — impulsive and eager to be the best. For people who don't know her, they might find her... difficult...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Natasha]: But you can trust her, even with your life. Stick around a bit longer and you'll see what I mean.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: We're here. This is Rivet Town... *sigh* Everything looks familiar...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Let's go, and watch your step. I haven't been here in a long time. There are probably some monsters around.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: We can't see anything here... Let's find higher ground to get a better view.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Way over there, see that house on the hill? That's Natasha's old orphanage.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: After Oleg found me, he sent me there. I spent over half my childhood in that place.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: It looks quite impressive...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: That must be a time of plenty.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I'd like to retire here.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Natasha said that the house was donated by some rich businessman. Whatever his business may have been, he must have been a good person.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Oh, I miss those carefree days as a kid...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: What? Nothing to say?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: No, it's just... this place seems familiar somehow. Never mind.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...Weirdo.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Look down there. See the mess that remains of those old stalls? That's Rivet Town's market. The supplies Natasha wants are probably there.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Let's keep moving. Watch out for monsters.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Careful! Enemies ahead.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: These aren't like vagrants. They won't—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Don't treat me like a new recruit. I'm all too familiar with the monsters of the Fragmentum. Let's get ready to fight!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: A... restaurant?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Heh, the most famous restaurant in town. Natasha would bring the kids who behaved well here for a special meal.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: So did she ever bring you?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Do I seem like I was a goody two-shoes? Of course not.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: The facilities here seem to be in pretty good shape, not like those of a place that has been abandoned for years.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Now that you mention it, it does seem a little... Could people still be living here? Impossible...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: There's a bunch of crates piled over there. Maybe we can find what we're looking for.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Watch out for monsters. They like to hide. If you need to, clear the area before you dig for the supplies.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Darn, how could they all be empty? Now even the monsters are gathering supplies?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: The monsters of the Fragmentum don't need any materials we humans use. And if they did take anything, this place would look much messier...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: You mean that someone else got here and took everything before us?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: It's just a guess, but there are also some footprints on the ground here.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: *sniff* The scent of dirt is still fresh. They can't have come too long before us.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Let's go then. We need to find something, even if we have to search every corner of this market.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...Eric?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hey, brat! How could you come here by yourself. Don't you know how dangerous this place is?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: S—Seele? Y—You aren't the boss of me! I—I can go wherever I want, it's none of your beeswax!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: You took the materials and hid them all here? Not bad, kid.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: But if we didn't take care of those monsters, what were you planning to do? Just stay here, shaking in your boots?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Wh—Who asked you to do anything? I was just about to escape, I didn't need your help at all!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Still stubborn, huh? Then tell me, how exactly were you gonna get those big metal plates out of here past those monsters?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Um... There's always a way...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: That's enough. He's just a kid...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Don't let him fool you. Everyone in the Underworld knows that this brat is a no-good thief. If I remember correctly, even the clothes you're wearing came off another kid's back?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Can you share the materials? They're to help injured people.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Don't be so polite to him. Everyone in the Underworld knows this brat is a no-good thief. If I remember correctly, even the clothes you're wearing came off another kid's back?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Uh... About that...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Tell us, what do you even want metal plates and gauze bandages for? We need them to save people.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: ...200...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: What?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Uh... 200 shield...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...Are you kidding me? You want to negotiate?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I... don't have any money with me.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Me neither... I never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: What a rip-off!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: It's just 200... but I never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: How much is 200 shield worth?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...Not much, but I didn't bring my coin purse.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: You're actually planning to give this little crook money? I'm telling you. This is his same old trick—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: No! ...Not this time. I really need money... my daddy...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Pretending to use your dad again as an excuse... If he knew about this, you'd be in big trouble.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: No... *sob*...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Seele! That's enough.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: It's Eric, right? Here, you can have this.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: What... what's this?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: This is a medal given to me by the Architects... See that blue stone in the middle? That's a Geomarrow crystal of the highest purity.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: You need money for your family, right? Take this and show it to a knowledgeable buyer, and they'll instantly know how valuable it is.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: *sniffle* ...Th—Thank you! I...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: But... you'll have to promise me one thing: You'll never steal other people's things again. Promise?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: I—I promise! I'll never steal things again!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...Then it's a deal. If you go back on your promise, I'm going to bring my Silvermane Guards with me and catch you myself! Here, take the medal and go back to the town. We already took care of any threat on the way. You'll be safe.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Th—Thank you, whoever you are! You guys can take all of these things!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Y—You guys need to be careful, too! There seems to be something real scary in that house up on the hill...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Eric]: Oh, r—right! The road across from the market is blocked... If you wanna go further, you'll have to go to the shopping street.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Got it. Thanks for the tip.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...That object was pretty important to you, right?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Are you sure you're okay just giving it to Eric like that?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: If it will make him change his ways, it's more than worth it.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hah, and what if he doesn't?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: From a young age, my mother taught me to be forgiving and to preserve the goodwill in people's hearts... Even if I am but a small glimmer of light in this world, I must try my best to shine brightly for others.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: I must give him a chance, Seele, because other people can't.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: I don't really get what you just said. Anyway, ahem, we should get moving.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Eric said that we need to take the shopping street to go any further. I think I still remember where it is... this way.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: This is the street alright. The orphanage should be at the end.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: These shops and signs... Why do I feel like I've seen them before?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: But when...?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: The entrance to the orphanage is up this way.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: I wonder what the old place is like now. Maybe some things will still look familiar.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: These stairs... they seem to have become more narrow.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Almost there! I didn't expect this place to be so well preserved.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Y'know, if we could've worked together to push back the Fragmentum... maybe we wouldn't have had to take off and leave our homes behind.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...We made it! It's been so long... but this place hasn't changed one bit.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Oh! It looks like there's a lot of stuff piled outside. Let's go see if there's any rubbing alcohol for Nat.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hey, where are you going!? Let's look around the orphanage first.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: These crates have been sitting here for many years, right? Even if they have materials in them, are you sure they are still usable...?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Do you think undergrounders care about expiration dates? Even having any supplies is a miracle in itself.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: No... No... Empty...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: How are they all empty? Who could've—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Careful! Enemy behind you!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: That's a big one...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: It looks tough...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: I've only seen this kind of monster before in the restricted zone...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hmph, I don't care how big you are. You dare sneak up on us from behind. This is it for you, pal!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Ha... That was it?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Well, it was three against one.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Nah, I could've taken it on by myself. But still... fighting alongside you two was pretty fun.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: It wouldn't have been so easy on your own though.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Please, you don't think I could do it? But still... fighting alongside you two was pretty fun.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Should be all clear now. Let's poke around.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: The kids at the orphanage were always getting into scraps when we played out here. If I remember it right, there ought to be some supplies for our cuts and bruises stored in that corner there.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: I just hope the monster didn't get to them.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...It wasn't my imagination.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Huh? What are you talking about?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: This building, this playground equipment... I've seen it all before.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: What!? Come on, the overground and underground have been sealed off from each other for over ten years. It would've been news if a Silvermane Guard had come down here, let alone an Overworld princess.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Wait, unless, before that...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...Yes, it's a possibility. That would explain why my memory of it is so blurry.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Come on, I need to look around a bit more before I can be sure...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: What's up here? Some kind of toy?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Yep. You pick, red or blue?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Hm... blue.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Ha! Look at this. After over ten years, the teeth marks are still here.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Teeth marks?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Alright, well... this one time, a big kid was trying to steal this toy from me. I couldn't outwrestle him for it, so I just bit down hard and hung on for dear life.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...How boorish.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: This swing is covered in dust... Hey, don't sit on it! It's filthy!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Ah, it sure brings back memories... I still remember one time I swung super high, and everyone was scared I would fly off.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...Who knew swinging could be so intense?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: At the time, I wanted to swing myself into the sky and fly up to the Overworld.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: So dangerous... You're lucky to have lived till now.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hmph, aren't we all, though?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: I found this. Here, take it.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: What is this? ...A brooch?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Natasha would often teach us how to make different handicrafts. This must be some kid's masterpiece.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: And why give it to me?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: You gave your medal to that kid Eric. This thing might not be as valuable, but it's at least a replacement of sorts.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: But didn't someone work hard to make this? I can't just take it from here...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...You sure are prissy, huh? Just take it.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: We've looked everywhere but here... I hope my memory is right.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: It's... Ah! Yes, we found it!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Great, and it's barely damaged! Nat wouldn't have expected her old supplies from years ago to have stayed in such good condition.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: You should still check the expiration date for things like rubbing alcohol. If it's expired, it won't be effective.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hm, true. Let me check a few bottles.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...Huh? What's this?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: This is...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: This is... something from when I was a child.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Wh—When you were a child!? Are you sure...?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: You came to this town as a child?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: No, I remember now...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Just a coincidence. Lots of kids probably have this toy.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: There is no such coincidence in this world. I remember now...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Could it be, when you were a child...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Yes. I remember now...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: I—I used to live here... B—Before the Architects took me away, before Madam Cocolia adopted me... I used to live here! I'm... an undergrounder.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: You're... an undergrounder? Wait a minute... you're saying that Cocolia, the Supreme Guardian, adopted you? Then—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Yes. I'm the successor chosen by the Architects. In the future, I will become the guardian who leads Belobog.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Why... Why didn't I remember this until now? My childhood memories are so blurry...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: You were too little to remember clearly.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Cocolia must have done something to make you forget.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: No, mother would never do that to me... there's no way she would.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: The Architects said that the guardian's successor is selected from among all people in Belobog. The selection process can take anywhere from a few years to a few decades.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: During that time, all children of the appropriate age in both the Overworld and the Underworld will be tested. In the end, only one child deemed as "worthy" will be chosen.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: I... must have been chosen from among the children here and then taken to the surface...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: The kids at the orphanage are always coming and going... I never thought that there would've been a future Supreme Guardian among us! Does Nat know about this? Could she have been keeping it a secret...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...I don't think she knows. The selection of the successor is done with utmost secrecy, and the child chosen must completely say goodbye to their past.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: And thus... I became the daughter of Madam Cocolia. My only identity is that of guardian successor, but I'm... not good enough...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Every day I see Silvermane Guards sacrifice their lives in the Fragmentum, but I've never had the resolve to change mother's mind.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: The Underworld has been struggling, but I never tried to help. I didn't even know that it was my own home that had fallen into such a dire state...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: In the end, I haven't been able to guard anything. How could they have thought I was worthy to be the successor...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hey! Are you done?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...Huh?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Wah wah wah... So annoying.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: I... What?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: What? You thought I should feel sorry for you after your little speech? You can hide in your palace while you fuss over your Overworld problems, and on the front line it's not even you who's putting their life in danger. But in the Underworld, what do we worry about? If we'll have food for our next meal or survive to the next week!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Even if I am but a small glimmer of light in this world, I must try my best to shine brightly for others. Didn't you say that? Well, if you really want to protect everyone, what are you standing here crying for? Get to it!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: You're right... You're right, self-pity doesn't help solve anything.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Thank you, Seele. Usually when I feel sorry for myself, I am met with gentle consolation. Never has anyone dared to be tough and make me snap out of it.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Hmph. I'm no good at consoling, but I can hit you on the head a few times. No problem.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...I can tell that you have a big burden to carry. Why do you force yourself to?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: ...As the successor to the guardian of Belobog, I must always be vigilant of my behavior and thoughts.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Yeah yeah, Lady Bronya~ Hmph, Miss Future Supreme Guardian comes from the same orphanage as me... Who thought it would be a good idea to put us together, huh?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: How about I show you around the orphanage a bit more? Unlike you, my memories from when I was little are crystal clear.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Okay, I'll indulge in old memories with you for a while.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: :
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: :
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][???]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: :
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][???]: Oh! It's here, we found it! Thank you, Perkins!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][???]: Beep — Don't mention it, Clara.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Guardbot]: Warning. Warning. Danger detected—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I mean no harm—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I'm just passing by—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I'm a goner—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Guardbot]: Protect Clara. Initiating active defense mode—
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Perkins, don't! Stop!
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: I've seen this person before.  not bad, right?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Perkins]: Command received. Danger removed. Deactivating active defense mode.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: This place is dangerous. You should leave.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: I'm looking for medicine to help the injured.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Oh? I came here for these painkillers, too.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: There are a lot of people hurt at the vagrant camp, I guess the miners are no different? *sigh* If everyone could just get along, things would be easier...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Shouldn't you be the one leaving, missy?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Perkins is protecting me. I'll be alright. I'm going to leave after I gather up these painkillers.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: ...Uh, is that what you're here for too?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: That would make sense. I'm sure a lot of miners are injured, right? *sigh* If everyone could just get along, things would be easier...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Mm... Here you are. I hope the medicine is of help to you...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: What's your relationship with Svarog?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Is Svarog here, too?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: No.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Mr. Svarog, he... he's my family. I met Mr. Svarog when I was real little. He took me in and took care of me.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: I'm really sorry about what happened back in the Great Mine... Mr. Svarog doesn't trust any humans besides me, especially everyone from Wildfire.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Why did Svarog attack us?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Mr. Svarog doesn't want to hurt people, but he always follows the calculations of his analysis. He thinks that interaction with humans is... inefficient.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Why did Svarog want to get involved in the incident in the mines?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: He heard that the miners and vagrants had begun to engage in a large-scale conflict... He wanted to stop everyone from getting hurt fighting over the mines.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Wildfire wants everyone to leave the underground... But Mr. Svarog wants everyone to stay here. According to his calculations, the overground is already unsafe.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: But the underground is safer?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Yes, at least according to Mr. Svarog's calculations...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: There must be some error in his system.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: No, there can't be... Mr. Svarog is healthy, his system is always being maintained.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: So he stands guard at the huge pillar stopping people from leaving?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Yes... Mr. Svarog is very stubborn.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: He says that his responsibility is "preservation." To do that, he must make decisions that best protect humanity.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: The Fragmentum will swallow up all of the underground sooner or later.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: Sounds a lot like the Supreme Guardian.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: I know that Wildfire wants to talk to Mr. Svarog... But no matter how many times you talk to him, Mr. Svarog won't change his mind...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: So, please trust me! I'll try to persuade Mr. Svarog. Hopefully, one day he will finally listen...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...Clara? What are you doing here?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: You're... Miss Seele from Wildfire? I came here to...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Narration]: You and Clara tell Seele and Bronya what you just discussed...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...Why are you helping the vagrants look for medicine? If they're so great, how could they make a little girl go around running errands for them?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: N—No, it's not like that. I wasn't made to do anything... It's just that, the living conditions for the vagrants aren't great. There's not even a clinic in their camp. So, I wanted to help them out.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Also, not all of them are bad people... everyone just wants to survive.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: ...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Miss Seele, did this medicine belong to Miss Natasha? Then... can you give me some? The vagrants' injuries are quite serious.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: *sigh* I see. Let's split these painkillers then.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: R—Really? We don't need to ask Miss Natasha first?
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: If I know Nat, she won't mind. Although this will make it more difficult for us... she'll understand. She always does.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: Great, thank you, Miss Seele...
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Are you leaving? This old town is too dangerous. We'll accompany you part of the way.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Clara]: I—It's fine, I have Perkins for company. And... I have some more things I need to look for here first.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Bronya]: Understood. Be careful, though.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Metal plates and bandages... rubbing alcohol... painkillers. Great, that's everything.
[The Past Will Return as an Avalanche][Seele]: Let's go report to Natasha in Boulder Town, it won't take long to get back.

[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Nat! We're back.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: Hehe, that's our Seele. Nothing if not punctual. So, did you find any usable supplies?
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: Let me see... metal plates, gauze bandages, painkillers, rubbing alcohol... Perfect, that's everything I needed.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: Huh... It's just, there are less painkillers than I'd expected. Did someone break into the storage room?
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: We shared some with Clara.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: ...Clara?
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: Monsters had destroyed some of them.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Hey, no need to lie, Nat wouldn't be upset about what we did.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Clara had already arrived at the storage room by the time we got there. We split the painkillers with her.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: ...If she was there too then... I understand. She wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? Clara's always been a kind-hearted girl...
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: I think you made the right decision. Still, it means I'm going to have to draw up a detailed dosage plan.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Hey, don't worry. I'll help you.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: Um, no need. I'll handle the clinic. I assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? Oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: I'd nearly forgotten about those two.
[Lying in Rust][Bronya]: So you guys aren't that close after all? I thought you were sworn friends.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: Haha, you're adorable, Bronya.  was obviously joking~
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: I forgot to say anything to them before I left...
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: I'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: I bet old Oleg wants to talk about Svarog. We should get going — sorry Nat, we'll have to leave the wounded to you.
[Lying in Rust][Natasha]: No worries, I hope things go smoothly.
[Lying in Rust][Bronya]: *yawn*
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Huh? Tired already?
[Lying in Rust][Bronya]: Aren't you? We didn't get any rest last night.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: You're gonna have to step it up, y'know. My record is six days no shut-eye.
[Lying in Rust][March 7th]: Hey, they're finally back!
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: Sorry for the unannounced disappearance.
[Lying in Rust][March 7th]: Ha, that's nothing — the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
[Lying in Rust][Dan Heng]: And that's something to be proud of?
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: Don't worry, I'm completely unscathed.
[Lying in Rust][March 7th]: ...Uh, I wasn't worried about you. If you must know, I was wondering if Bronya was okay.
[Lying in Rust][Dan Heng]: Oh please — you've barely sat still since they left.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Hahaha, it's good to have everyone back together. Let me get straight to it...
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Regarding this "Stellaron" and your predicament in the Overworld, your friends have gone over both with me again.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: The last time I saw Cocolia, she was an impressive young lady... I never thought that after becoming the guardian...
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: All I can say is that I sympathize with your situation. Rest easy. Wildfire won't go behind your back on this.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Your plan sounds a bit like the ravings of a drunken miner, but at least you're offering a road forwards. We Underworlders haven't had a road to anywhere for a long time now, and you can see how things have become. I'm willing to give you guys a shot.
[Lying in Rust][March 7th]: Don't worry, Mr. Oleg, we'll make sure you don't regret it!
[Lying in Rust][Dan Heng]: Ravings of a drunken miner is a little harsh.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Maybe it is! But I think we need to set our sights on something a bit more realistic. You guys want to know the whereabouts of the Stellaron. Wildfire wants to remove the restrictions on the Underworld...
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: In other words, Svarog is the target of both our efforts. If we can't deal with the boss, we can't deal with anything.
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: You're right. Let's go take him down!
[Lying in Rust][Dan Heng]: Diplomacy before violence. We should try peaceful communication first.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Both your approaches have merit. We would always rather avoid losses and settle matters through peaceful means. But if the situation changes, we must be prepared for armed conflict at a moment's notice.
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: We need to find a way to bring him over to our side.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Hmph, he wouldn't understand — you're forgetting he's a robot. It'd be faster to smash him to scrap metal!
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: We should make preparations for both approaches. Of course, it's better to settle matters through peaceful means. But if the situation changes, we must be prepared for armed conflict at a moment's notice.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Wildfire has tried many times to make contact with Svarog — without success. He has no intention of engaging with us.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: At our current strength, it would be incredibly dangerous to use force. Svarog's robots don't fear sacrifice, and I don't want to risk Underworld lives.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: But things have changed — your arrival constitutes an "external variable" for Svarog. I may not have the full picture, but perhaps you guys have an opportunity to sway him.
[Lying in Rust][Dan Heng]: That would be best.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Hahahaha! Our scheme is coming along nicely! But I fear that Svarog just isn't the swaying type. *sigh* You'll understand when you get to his territory. Things never run smoothly down here.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: What about you, Miss Silvermane? You're the only one here that isn't compelled to do or die with Svarog. I'd like to hear your plan.
[Lying in Rust][Bronya]: The Underworld is still a part of Belobog. If Svarog's existence constitutes a threat to the people here, I will of course stand with you.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Hahaha, excellent! An enlightened answer, young lady — and spoken like a true successor to the guardianship.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Seeing as we're all on the same side, there's no reason to delay. Let's go, I've arranged for a guide to take you to Svarog.
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: You're not coming?
[Lying in Rust][Narration]: What will Wildfire be doing?
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Wildfire's relationship with Svarog has been hostile for a long time now, accompanying you would only lead to misunderstandings. We'll be nearby, awaiting orders. If things go south, we'll be there in no time.
[Lying in Rust][Oleg]: Seele, perhaps you can take our outsider friends the rest of the way.
[Lying in Rust][Seele]: Mm, I'm on it, boss.

[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...Hook? You...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: This I really wasn't expecting...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: So, The Moles are a part of Wildfire...
[To Rot or to Burn][Hook]: Th—That's right! It's me, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great! What do you want?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Uh, kiddo, I think there's been a misunderstanding...
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: I will be your guide, friends. By order of Chief Oleg...
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: I gotta say I'm a little upset at the thought of you choosing a toddler over your old buddy Sampo...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Alright, alright, don't get started. But I wanna ask you something: Everyone in Wildfire knows the location of Svarog's lair. Why do we need you as a guide?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: *sigh* My specialties in the field, perhaps? Wildfire may know where the base is, but have they ever been inside?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: You've been inside?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: ...No. But I've felt my way around the outside and picked up more than a few clues. I can help you. You have my word.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Let's hope you can walk the talk.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Hey, what are you trying to say!? Name me someone above or below ground that walks the talk like Sampo Koski.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Oleg put his trust in you...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Hey, what are you trying to say!? You guys wouldn't have even gotten to know Wildfire without my help, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Clues for your own shady dealings, no doubt.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Hey! That's not nice! Wildfire made a request and I got on with the job.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: My legacy will prove that Sampo Koski was nothing but a willing and devoted servant of—
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Ugh, enough! Jeez! We believe you, okay? Show us the way already.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Great! Stay close.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Sampo... Are we there yet?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Do you have to ask every other minute, missy? Two more steps, just two more steps and you're there.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: This is Svarog's lair? I thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Many vagrants are staying here temporarily. Their homes were overrun by monsters.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Isn't it dangerous for them to make camp right under Svarog's metal nose?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: No. Svarog may be ruthless, but he never attacks without reason. For those with no home, this is actually a safe place to be.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Hm... If I hadn't moved away when I did, I'd probably be where they are right now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Devoted Vagrant]: Did you hear? Those idiots got into a fight in the mine, haha! It only got settled after Boss Svarog showed up.
[To Rot or to Burn][Devoted Vagrant]: I've said it before — only Boss Svarog can protect us down here. Everyone should follow his lead.
[To Rot or to Burn][Devoted Vagrant]: Well, what do you think? Cat got your tongue?
[To Rot or to Burn][Reticent Vagrant]: ...Do you ever talk about anything else? I'm so tired of hearing about Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][Devoted Vagrant]: B—But it's true. What else is there to say? Take a look at all these good-for-nothings... They'd starve to death without him.
[To Rot or to Burn][Vagrant Newcomer]: Did you see those extra boxes of medical supplies at the depot? Who brought those over?
[To Rot or to Burn][Experienced Vagrant]: Clara, I assume? I can't think of anyone else that'd do something that generous.
[To Rot or to Burn][Vagrant Newcomer]: Who's Clara? Is she one of us?
[To Rot or to Burn][Experienced Vagrant]: Not even close! She's Svarog's trusted family.
[To Rot or to Burn][Vagrant Newcomer]: Family... of a robot?
[To Rot or to Burn][Experienced Vagrant]: Well, you'll understand when you've been here a while longer.
[To Rot or to Burn][Earnest Vagrant]: No, no, no! You can't insert the microcrystalline unit into the heat sink substrate like that.
[To Rot or to Burn][Suspicious Vagrant]: How do you know? Balaway from Miner's Lamp said that you need to pay attention to the interfaces when assembling relics.
[To Rot or to Burn][Suspicious Vagrant]: To make this thing move again, we need to connect the microcrystalline unit to the operating brake module. Otherwise, it's just a pile of scrap metal.
[To Rot or to Burn][Earnest Vagrant]: If you believe a word that senile idiot Balaway says, you're done for. The last time he acted on his own advice, he electrocuted himself.
[To Rot or to Burn][Earnest Vagrant]: You should be asking people with real smarts. No one is better at fixing machines than Marev.
[To Rot or to Burn][Earnest Vagrant]: I saw him connecting a microcrystalline conductor unit to a logic control hub to get a vibrating drill to work.
[To Rot or to Burn][Suspicious Vagrant]: Haha, Marev!? Him and his brother wouldn't know a real relic if it hit 'em in the face. Last I heard, he got scammed by someone selling counterfeit junk.
[To Rot or to Burn][Earnest Vagrant]: Ahh, you're just salty, my friend!
[To Rot or to Burn][Vagrant Rapper]: Yo, yo, listen up. This one's for all you pretend rappers...
[To Rot or to Burn][Vagrant Rapper]: Internal Combustion Engine champion — 88 Degrees Bedrock — reppin' the dawn of the Underworld rap. Here's something to wake up your soul, check it...
[To Rot or to Burn][Vagrant Rapper]: 
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Repairs-Duty Vagrant: Hold still. You're nearly fixed.
[To Rot or to Burn][Grouchy Robot]: My design has been superceded by newer models. My components are no longer valuable.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Repairs-Duty Vagrant: Hey! What are you talking about? I'm not interested in selling your components.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Alas, this place is a bit of a mixed bag — plenty of... "characters." Keep your wits about you, friends. Don't let anyone deceive you.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: It's all good. We've had you for practice.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Y'know missy, you sure know how to bear a grudge.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: What a heavy gate... Okay, watch this!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Opennnn sesame~!
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Is that a secret code or something?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: It's an imaginary password that children like to use... and I don't think it's going to be of much use.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: What about these clues of yours?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: I was just about to get into those, before Miss March's colorful attempt.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Help us pry the gate open.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Whoa, whoa! Pry it open? In front of all these vagrants and robots? They have eyes, you know.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Luckily for us, I've already figured out the mechanism for this gate. They don't just let any Joe Shmoe in and out of Boss Svarog's territory. I mean, if you wanna see the big cheese himself, you need "certification."
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Certification?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Correct, only prospectors with the right certification can get in or out. These prospectors collect mechanical remnants from all over the underground, and then bring them to Svarog for him to repair.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Honestly, it's a very profitable little venture. If only I'd beaten him to it... Hehe, they'd be calling me Sampo "Boss-ki" by now...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...Time out. Where do we get this "certification"?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: That's simple. You see the robots over by the vagrants? They're all Svarog's scouts — every one of them is commanded to maintain order here.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Apart from them keeping a watchful eye on these hooligans, another one of their duties is "processing." Anyone who wants to become a prospector has to pass a test from these walkin' stoplights first.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: What's the test?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Spelling test or combat test?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Do they give you a gachapon for the test?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Not a clue, I never had the urge to go on a Svarog suicide mission before. You guys are the ones that want in, why not go and ask the robots?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: It feels like the people here are all under the supervision of robots...
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: This would be unthinkable on the surface. Robots are merely tools in the Overworld.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Don't take Svarog as an ordinary robot. He's, uh... special.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: This has to be one of them, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: It looks so... lame.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Is it even awake in there? Maybe it's broken down.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Beep... Boop...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Ah! That scared me.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Protocol initiating... Scanning... Verifying.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Certification failure... Subject has yet to obtain access permissions. Launching processing.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Huh? Are we starting now!?
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Launching stage one processing. Please listen to the following question...
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Who is the reigning champion of the Internal Combustion Engine Rap Tournament?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Infernal construction what now? How would we know anything about that!
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Sampo, do you know the answer?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Sampo Koski always knows the... Wait, what did it say again?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Ugh, aren't you supposed to be dependable?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Well, I don't know everything. *sigh* Sometimes you've gotta ask around if you wanna know the answer. Don't panic... Let's listen in to what these vagrants are talking about, we might just hit the jackpot.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Please answer the following question: Who is the reigning champion of the Internal Combustion Engine Rap Tournament?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Dr. Dig
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Incorrect answer. Certification result: Failure.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: ...Uh, y'know friends, if you don't know the answer, you don't have to pretend you do. No one's gonna laugh at you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Reassessing... Subject threat index: High. Initializing combat module. Threat elimination activated.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Combat module? This thing's faulty, right...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Wishful thinking, it's about to attack!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: 88 Degrees Bedrock
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Correct answer.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Whoa! Was that a lucky guess? *gasp* Did you go to a music festival without us?
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Certification result: Success. Requisite certifications remaining: Two.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Please extend your right hand.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: My right hand? Here you go. Why is this part of the— Hey, hey! Ow, ow, ow!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...So this is the certification mark?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Great, only two more steps to go. Let's move.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Relic Gang
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Incorrect answer. Certification result: Failure.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: ...Uh, y'know friends, if you don't know the answer, you don't have to pretend you do. No one's gonna laugh at you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Reassessing... Subject threat index: High. Initializing combat module. Threat elimination activated.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Combat module? This thing's faulty, right...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Wishful thinking, it's about to attack!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Let's listen in on some conversations...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Phew...That was scary, it just suddenly attacked!
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: This button says "system reset." Let's give it a try.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: ...System reset... successful. Certification sequence... online.
[To Rot or to Burn][Certification Robot]: Please extend your right hand.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: My right hand? Here you go. Why is this part of the— Hey, hey! Ow, ow, ow!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...So this is the certification mark?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Great, only two more steps to go. Let's move.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Beep... Boop...
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Protocol... initiating. Scanning... Ugh. I'm so sick of repeating this.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Ha? What did this bucket of bolts just say?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Seems like this one's got a temper...
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Ugh, let's get this over with. Did you get your first certification? If not then you're wasting your time.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: You mean this? Here, look.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Yeah, yeah, whatever... Here comes your question, listen up.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Riddle me this: A microcrystalline unit should be connected to which component?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Heat sink substrate.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Wrong! Congratulations.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Simple question, terrible answer. It's back to school for you!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ..., can I smash this can opener already!?
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Huh!? You wanna go? You caught me in a bad mood, let's do this!
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: If we turn you into scrap metal, we still get our certification, right? Suits me!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Operating brake module.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Wrong! Congratulations.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Simple question, terrible answer. It's back to school for you!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ..., can I smash this can opener already!?
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Huh!? You wanna go? You caught me in a bad mood, let's do this!
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: If we turn you into scrap metal, we still get our certification, right? Suits me!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Logic control hub.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Huh? Lucky guess.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Ugh! Now I have to do this again. Put your hand out.
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: What are you doing? I meant her, give me your hand!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: March, put your hand out.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Huh? Me again? It hurts, y'know!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...Ah! Owwww...
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: There, one step left. Now get outta here and leave me in peace...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Let's listen in on some conversations...
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: You don't know the answer? That's lame. It's back to school for you!
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: ...Wait, have mercy! I'm sorry! One certification, coming right up!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Hehe, now we're talkin'!
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Okay, please extend your right hand...
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: Not you, the girl over there!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Huh? Me again? It hurts, y'know!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: March, put your hand out.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Huh? Me again? It hurts, y'know!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...Ah! Owwww!
[To Rot or to Burn][Irritable Robot]: There you are, only one more to go. Now, please leave me in peace...
[To Rot or to Burn][Malfunctioning Robot]: Beep... Boop...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Whatever the case, we'll need it to identify our certifications.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: There's something wrong with this one...
[To Rot or to Burn][Malfunctioning Robot]: Protocol... Inish-nish-nish-nish-nish...
[To Rot or to Burn][Malfunctioning Robot]: Initialization failure. Attempting system restorashhhh...
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Not encouraging...
[To Rot or to Burn][Malfunctioning Robot]: System restoration failure. Core module damaged. External threat detected.
[To Rot or to Burn][Malfunctioning Robot]: Threat elimination activated. Initializing combat module.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Ha! Finally, no more racking our brains. This rust bucket's about to meet its maker!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: (Enter battle against  Automaton Beetle ×2,  Automaton Hound ×1
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Ha! Learned how to behave now?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Let me try and reset its system...
[To Rot or to Burn][Malfunctioning Robot]: ...Certification system online. Please extend your right hand.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: *sigh* ...Why is it always me...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Aaaah!!! How come it hurt even more than the other two!? Hmph, at least that's the final step...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: We can get in now, right? Hehe, Svarog's certification system is no match for us!
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: This better work. Let's get back to the gate and give it a go.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Opennnn sesame~!
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: See? Not so bad having Sampo on the team after all, right? Chief Oleg knew all along that I—
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Yeah, yeah, thank you very much.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: I'll commend you to the chief. No need to waste your time.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Alright, well let me issue a warning now: Everything from here on out is uncharted territory — we must proceed with the utmost caution...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Now to set the record straight with Svarog. Let's get in there!
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: ...Ugh! Did anyone hear what I just said?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: A gate...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Ugh... Why is there another gate here!?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: It looks like this gate has a more complicated structure than the last one...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Sampo, what is this?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...Sampo? Where is he?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Ugh! Where did he run off to — he was just here a second ago!
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: ...This isn't the first time.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: It's that same type of robot again! Please don't tell me there's another round of "processing."
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Visitors for Svarog detected.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Protocol initiating... Scanning... Verifying.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Who's a good boy? Here's our certification, we just wanna see your master.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Ooh, good plan! Treat the robots like guard dogs!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...How is that gonna improve our chances?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Careful, this one might have a few tricks up its sleeve.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Are we gonna smash this one too? Count me in.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Certification failure... Subject has yet to obtain access permissions.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Request rejected. Visitors must acquire access permissions from Miss Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Clara? Oh, the girl we saw in the Great Mine?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: We need to get permissions from her? What's she got to do with this?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: She's Svarog's family.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: She's Svarog's owner.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: She's his "family..." Did you really forget?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Family... Huh, weird.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Don't trouble yourself about it. We need to find her.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: ...I don't know if this will work, but it's worth a try: Where is Clara right now?
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Obtaining audio data, please wait...
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: The energy core's bearing component is broken... If we don't repair it soon, the settlement will be pitch-black.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Timmy, I'm going back to Rivet Town — maybe I can recover some usable components. You need to guard the gate while I'm gone.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Recording recovery complete. Resuming execution of Clara's commands.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: She went back? But we were just there. *sigh* Sounds like we better head over again.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Wait, you guys went sightseeing in another town?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...It wasn't as fun as you think.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: That town has danger lurking in every corner.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Indeed. And that little girl heading into the Fragmentum all by herself... It doesn't bear thinking about.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We should go and find Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: That little girl heading into the Fragmentum all by herself... It doesn't bear thinking about.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Her strength belies her appearance, but even so...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: You don't look so tough yourself. Well, let's find her. Svarog's not going anywhere.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: This is a big town. Where should we start?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Clara said she was going to find components, right? Let's start with Nat's storage room.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Isn't this the robot that was following Clara around?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...These can openers all look the same. How can you tell them apart?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Shh, it's about to say something. Listen...
[To Rot or to Burn][Perkins]: Initializing self-repair module... Initialization failure...
[To Rot or to Burn][Perkins]: Clara... in danger...
[To Rot or to Burn][Perkins]: Must... protect...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: In danger? What do you mean?
[To Rot or to Burn][Perkins]: Workshop... target... must be eliminated...
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Does it mean that a monster appeared over at the workshop? Clara, she...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Not good. She's in danger! Quick. Let's head over to the workshop and check it out. I know the way.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Just as we feared, there's something big over there! And there's Clara — we have to save her!
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Let's go. No need to fear. We have the numerical advantage.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Are you okay, Clara? Are you hurt?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Th—Thanks, everyone. I'm fine. Just a few scratches.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: You shouldn't be running around by yourself. It's too dangerous. What are you looking for here?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: There's a fault with one of the energy supply units at the base. If I don't repair it soon, everyone at the settlement will be affected.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I knew there was a workshop in this town, so I wanted to try my luck here. I found all the components I need, but then I ran into a monster...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: You guys saved me — I'll tell Mr. Svarog about it.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Speaking of Svarog...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...We were planning on paying him a visit.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We were just about to pay him a visit.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...Huh? What do you need to see him for? I can pass him a message...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: No, this time we need to set things straight with him face to face. Can you take us to meet him?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: But... Mr. Svarog doesn't like talking to others, especially Wildfire...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Don't I know it. But he's evaded communication with us for too long — this time we have to see him.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Um... I know you're working hard for the people down here, but Mr. Svarog doesn't trust human emotions. He only trusts his calculation results.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: So, I can't take you to see him... If Mr. Svarog and you had a fight, someone would get hurt for sure. Maybe even bystanders...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Listen kid, you—
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Clara, you said it yourself before, right? Svarog's duty is to protect the Underworld and preserve the civilization here. We have the same wish. Why would he refuse to cooperate with us?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I know Mr. Svarog. He isn't affected by other people's wishes. He only follows logical judgments.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Terrible things are happening on this world... Mr. Svarog thinks that the Overworld will end soon.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: According to his calculation results, the strength of the Underworlders won't be enough to prevent the disaster.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: His plan is to keep the Underworlders away from the source of the disaster, so they can survive for longer...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...Isn't that just putting us in a cage? It's ridiculous — what difference does it make if our death gets postponed a couple of days? How is that better than putting up a fight?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: See it as returning the favor, Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I'll definitely return the favor! But not like this...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We have to see him, whatever the cost.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I'm sorry... I really can't help you with this.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Why don't we think of another way?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I'm always trying to convince Mr. Svarog. Please give me more time...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Um, if you don't mind... I still have important things to do. I'll go back now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Clara—
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: It's no use, Seele. She's made up her mind. I could tell from her expression.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: We will have to think of another way...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: That's no ordinary kid. So young and yet so... stubborn? No, intelligent?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: She's incisive, and determined... in sharp contrast to you, March.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...Did you really have to add that last part!?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: It looks like we'll have to get past Clara if we want to speak to Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: If we can't even persuade Clara...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...Then good luck persuading that mass of metal.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Is there any other way?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: If we circumvent Clara and the gate, Svarog will only identify us as intruders. He'll be even more likely to give us the cold shoulder.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Isn't a robot shoulder cold to begin with?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Clara mentioned Svarog's "calculation results" many times...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: The strength of the Underworlders won't be enough to prevent the disaster... Those were her exact words. For me, that's our starting point.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: So... you think Svarog's logic has a hole in it?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: No, his calculation is correct. At its current strength, it is highly unlikely that Wildfire would be able to resolve the problems stemming from the Stellaron. However, that calculation didn't take the present situation into account. There's a new variable yet to be added to the equation...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We're the new variable.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We need him to recognize our value.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: ...Precisely. If we can make Svarog believe in us, we can almost certainly overturn the result of his calculation, and we'll be one step closer to peace talks.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: But, how we can get him to do that... Showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: There's always a way. But first, we have to convince Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: I assume she must be on her way back to the robot settlement. Let's catch up with her.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: She turned that way, quick!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Huh? Where'd she go? We just saw her go this way.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: *sigh* We'll just have to head straight and keep looking.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Hmm... why won't it...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Argh... I can't figure it out...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...Oh, it's you. You came with me after all.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We couldn't give up that easily.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: You're the underground's only hope.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: You keep saying that, but...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Are you repairing this installation, Clara? Hit a snag?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Huh? How did you know?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: The dimensions and wear of these two roller components look very different from the rest of the unit. You must have only just replaced them.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: You replaced the damaged components, but the unit isn't starting up as normal. That's what you're trying to figure out, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...Yeah. I've fixed a lot of things before, but I never had to repair one as complicated as this.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Why isn't Svarog helping you?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I don't want to disturb him. This installation was... accidentally damaged by two of the vagrants. If Mr. Svarog finds out, they'll get in big trouble...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Was it really an accident...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: You give a lot of thought to others.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...Y'know Clara, if you're too kind, people can take advantage of you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: I think I found the source of the problem. You replaced the rollers, but the bearing is causing a jam — there's a misalignment.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: , March, give me a hand. We should be able to fix it between us.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: More fixing? I'm getting good at this!
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Can we really fix this?
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Relax, we got this. Right, Dan Heng?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: ...Less asking, more helping.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Whoa! It lit up! Thanks guys!
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: No need. We hardly lifted a finger. So, the settlement's energy supply problem is solved for the time being?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Yes. The people on the outskirts don't need to worry about heat or light now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Umm...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We're not trying to win you over.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I understand. You helped a lot of injured people in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies. You're good people.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: On the issue of Svarog...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I know that you're good people. You helped a lot of the injured in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: If there's any other way I can help you, I'll do my best! But this...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: *sigh* How are we gonna convince her?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Remind her of the "present situation."
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: The present situation is... we're here! This planet isn't doomed after all...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Point out the "variable."
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: The variable is... our arrival! No outsider's set foot in the underground for over a decade...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Make something up.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...You might be putting a little too much faith in me, .
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Clara, you're observant, right? Take a look at us. Do we look like Underworlders?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Well, uhh... you do look very different from other people.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Right! That's because we're not from here. We've never been a factor in Svarog's calculations. And if those calculations are based solely on "the strength of the Underworlders," then the results don't apply to the present situation.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: When did Svarog start doing his calculations, Clara?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: It was... a long time ago. The same time the Underworld was sealed off, I think...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Circumstances have changed since then — there's a Silvermane Guard down here now! Is that part of Svarog's calculation? Not to mention, we're—
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Not even from this planet!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Completely separate variables!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...Just tell her already! We come from a different planet!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Three people more than when we started!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: That's your big reveal? The important part is: We're from a different planet!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: There's just no way that Svarog's calculations would have included variables like us, y'know?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Different planet...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: D—Don't treat me like a child! Those are just made-up stories that grown-ups like to tell. I don't...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: They're not made-up.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: In other worlds, people have already conquered the heavens.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: But you ARE a child...
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Hey.  and March aren't lying, Clara. I believe them.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Bronya, do you really...
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: I know how you feel, Clara. You want new hope for the underground, but you don't want anyone to get hurt in the process, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: I also have doubts... But my gut tells me that March, Dan Heng, and ... They are the new hope this world has been waiting for.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Let them meet Svarog, and let's see if his calculation result is any different. For you, for him... there's no harm in trying, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: You've already seen our ability.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We will bring change to this world.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Come onnnn, what have we got to lose?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I... Okay. I'll take you to see Mr. Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Really? Awesome!
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...Mm. I understand now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Trying to change Mr. Svarog's mind on my own would take forever. Even if I kept trying until I was all grown up, I don't think I could do it.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: And all the while, people would be getting sick, losing their homes, and fighting... just like in the mine.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I don't want that to happen. If you guys really believe that you can convince Mr. Svarog... then I need to be brave too.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Everyone, follow me.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Bronya! I didn't know you'd stick up for us like that back there — well said!
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: It was nothing. I just... said what I truly felt.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...I'm back, Timmy.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Welcome back, Miss Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Timmy, open the gate please. I want to see Mr. Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Outsiders detected. Do you wish to permit access?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: It's okay. They're all my guests.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Command received. Access restriction terminal unlocked.
[To Rot or to Burn][Wandering Robot]: Welcome back, Miss Clara and guests.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Uhh... If you can, please try not to upset Mr. Svarog...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: It's okay, Clara! We're here to reason with him.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: I'll leave negotiations to you guys. They're not my strong point.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Negotiating with robots... I can't say I've tried it before.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: , are you ready?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Let's go and see Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Hold on a moment...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: I'm back, Mr. Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: I see that the energy supply system is back online. Thank you, Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: But... why have you brought them?
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog... they want to talk to you about going to the surface.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Analyzing... Analysis result: Target does not belong to Wildfire. Background: Unknown. Classification: Unknown.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: You have arrived on Clara's recommendation. I will give you an opportunity to speak.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Hey, sounds like he's willing to communicate! Quick, , time to smooth-talk him!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We're not interested in stoking conflict.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: You seek peace, understood. Nevertheless, your statement is unilateral.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: My position will be determined after assessing the result of our negotiation.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We're here about the future of the underground.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: An inadequate pretext. You are not from the underground. You have no right to represent Underworld humanity.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: To be, or not to be, that is the question!
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Said question lacks the necessary context to be answered.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Proceed with your central point. Do not waste this world's valuable time.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: He cut you off completely! This guy...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Stay focused. Remember, we have to make him see that we're a variable in the calculation.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We're here about the Stellaron.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Do you know what a Stellaron is?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: W—We're a variable!
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Think before opening your mouth!
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Stellaron...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Searching database... Access denied. Discussing "Stellaron" with unauthorized targets: Prohibited.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: You are broaching a secret that lies at the heart of this world. A secret that should remain unknown to humanity.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Reassessing targets... Threat index raised. I demand that you reveal your true intention.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: As expected... He knows of the Stellaron, but it's a restricted topic...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: We've come this far. Out with it already! , just be straight with him! Everything depends on it.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We must find the Stellaron, and then...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We want to bring this world's disasters to a close.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Historical records state that humanity has already made multiple efforts to engage with the Stellaron. Without exception, these efforts have been motivated by human greed — attempts to secure the article for a selfish end.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: As instructed by the Architects: Any attempt to engage with the Stellaron will result in grave consequences. Reassessing... Target threat index critical.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: What should we do? This is going from bad to worse!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Wait, we're not like those others!
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: There is no evidence to suggest you are an exception. Calculation result remains unchanged.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Your powers of calculation suck.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Target hostility significantly exceeds base index. Calculation result remains unchanged.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Peacekeeping protocal temporarily disengaged... Requestion extermination protocol launch.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: E—Extermination? In the literal sense?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Peace talks are over — March, prepare for combat!
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog! Please, don't—
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Leave, Clara!
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Clara, it's dangerous here! Find somewhere to hide!
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Tsk... looks like we have to take action after all.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Prototype number 3, monitoring automaton Svarog, exterminal protocol launch: successful.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: ...Annihilation permitted!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: ×1)
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Hah, how can you put up your best fight without a doctor on the battlefield?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: All of you, stay focused. I'm right behind you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Nat? How did you...
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Guess you guys had a bad talk, huh? Luckily, Sampo's got your back!
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Sampo! I knew you'd be involved somehow...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Base breached. Armed Wildfire personnel detected. Assessing...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: All subjects are high-risk individuals. Commencing complete annihilation!
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Wait... Wait!
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Please don't hurt Mr. Svarog!
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: C—Clara? ...You...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog can't fight anymore! Please... Please don't hurt him!
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Cla...ra...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog... Don't push yourself any further. Can you tell them what you know?
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog, you said you were willing to make all my wishes come true, right? My biggest wish right now is for everyone to work together. Like... like family.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Recently, I learned something new... Calculation results can't always bring people happiness.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Even if the world outside the cage isn't beautiful... people still want to know what it's like.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Assessment system reset... successful. Processing variables...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Variable 1: Clara's request... Variable 2: Outsiders' intentions.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: ...Updated assessment result: Transference of decision-making authority to outsiders. Outsiders are granted access to Stellaron intelligence.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: So... So we did it?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: The cost was too great.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Clara seems like the only one who can break through Svarog's cold logic. It's a good thing she was here.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Thanks to Clara...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Yeah! Without her, even if we'd defeated Svarog, there's no way he'd have given us access to the intel, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Our strength has been recognized.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Although, if Clara hadn't been here... Svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? Even up until the end.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: I hope his memory bank really does contain data on the Stellaron.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Is this it, Nat? Us, Wildfire, the Underworld... Did... did we win?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: No, Seele.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Our battle... their battle... it's just beginning.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Finally... We finally made it to this point.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...What's up, nervous?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: No, but... I do have an aching feeling in my chest.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: The truth can be heartbreaking.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: It's up to you to make your own judgment about who's lying now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...I'm ready, . Reveal the truth. I'm listening.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: I have finished collating the Stellaron data and records. Do you wish to proceed, outsiders?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Let's have it.

[To Rot or to Burn][Old Guardian]: The people will struggle to accept this conclusion, doctor. If we were to tell them that the almighty Alisa Rand activated this thing and triggered the Eternal Freeze...
[To Rot or to Burn][Voice of Researcher]: It's the truth, madam... The truth won't change with the opinions of the people. The reports before you are the precious result of painstaking effort on the part of Belobog's greatest scholars. You must trust the weight of its conclusion...
[To Rot or to Burn][Old Guardian]: ...I have never doubted you, doctor. On the contrary, I am resolute in the face of this conclusion.
[To Rot or to Burn][Old Guardian]: From the moment I took up this mantle, that voice... their voice — has made its home in my mind. I cannot shake them.
[To Rot or to Burn][Old Guardian]: ...I shouldn't be telling you this — let's return to your research, doctor. I'm afraid I cannot make these reports known to the public. Unless...
[To Rot or to Burn][Voice of Researcher]: Unless? Unless what? Please proceed, madam...
[To Rot or to Burn][Voice of Guardian]: ...Unless you have found a way to completely destroy the Stellaron.
[To Rot or to Burn][Voice of Researcher]: I understand. In the name of Preservation... I will fulfill this mission.

[To Rot or to Burn][Old Researcher]: *coughing* Y—You're still young, child. There will come a day... a day when you do understand.
[To Rot or to Burn][Old Researcher]: The Supreme Guardian... sh—she sees further than you or I. All her decisions are for the security of Belobog...
[To Rot or to Burn][Young Researcher]: I just think... it's a shame. Our research has hit an obstacle. Meanwhile, your results will be buried in the snow.
[To Rot or to Burn][Old Researcher]: *coughing* Don't be upset, child. You still have lots of time ahead of you. When you find a way to destroy — *coughing* — destroy the Stellaron... our efforts will have been worth it.

[To Rot or to Burn][Young Guardian]: ...This is... Why is there a robot here?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Guardian's Bodyguard: During his life, this was Dr. Mearsheimer's personal robot bodyguard. I heard it's a prototype from the great war.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Guardian's Bodyguard: Since the doctor and his assistants passed away, it's remained here. It hasn't moved an inch.
[To Rot or to Burn][Young Guardian]: Oh... I see. Let's start. We must unearth the doctor's research conclusions — all of them.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Guardian's Bodyguard: Madam Guardian, I've found them... All the documents are here.
[To Rot or to Burn][Young Guardian]: Mm... good. That'll do.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Guardian's Bodyguard: Madam Guardian, what should we do with the robot?
[To Rot or to Burn][Young Guardian]: Ah... It would seem a great waste to destroy it. Find someone to reset its system and then arrange for it to be sent to the Underworld. I hear that the development group is in need of a robot with defense capabilities.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Guardian's Bodyguard: Yes, madam.
[To Rot or to Burn][Young Guardian]: I'm sorry, doctor... but these results must be taken care of by the Architects.
[To Rot or to Burn][Young Guardian]: One day, somebody will be able to carry out your behest.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Cache number 57614, transmission complete. Concluding data transmission.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: ...So the truth is clear now, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: They were looking for a way to destroy the Stellaron...
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: And it would appear that they never succeeded.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: I didn't quite understand. Can someone go over it again?
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Putting minor details aside, this is the conclusion... Eminent individuals, not to mention the guardian herself, knew early on that the Stellaron was the source of disaster on this world.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: But in order to maintain the peace, they decided to hide the truth. Secret research detailing a method for destroying a Stellaron ended in failure.
[To Rot or to Burn][Dan Heng]: Now only one question remains... Why would Cocolia exhibit such a sudden change in her attitude towards us?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Bronya? Are you okay?
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...I'm fine. I just... feel a little faint.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: This must be a lot to take in for you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: You can believe us now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: Why...? Why, mother...? M—Maybe she wasn't aware, maybe she...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...I'm sorry. It's no use lying to yourself, Bronya. It's time for you to make a decision.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: ..., can I have a word with you? I know that we'll need time to process this new information, but we have to decide on our next plan as soon as possible.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog, are you okay? Let me repair your language module first...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Assessing... Language module operating as normal. Thank you, Clara.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Did your memory module get damaged? Maybe I can fix that too.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Retrieving memory module...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Architect machine era records: intact. War of Defense combat data: intact. Geomarrow Development Group era records: intact...
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: Record of Clara's crafting of miniature magnetic drill rigs: intact. Record of Clara's explanation of human "sleeping in" behavior: intact...
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: S—So, your memory module is okay?
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: I have made a backup of all records pertaining to you, Clara. Do not worry.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...Even the one about sleeping in?
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: There are multiple backups. I can recover them at any time.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog, can I delete some of them...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: I cannot grant this request. Records pertaining to you constitute important data, Clara. They must remain intact.
[To Rot or to Burn][Svarog]: They are memories of family.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: ...I understand.
[To Rot or to Burn][Clara]: Mr. Svarog, I still want to help you check a few other modules... Turn around a little.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: At daybreak, the guardian shall be a glittering star, illuminating the people's path.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: At nightfall, the guardian shall be a flickering flame, comforting the people's soul.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: So many years... Have I been following lies this whole time?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Hey... maybe you should find someone to talk to...
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: Don't let it get you down — you can share your feelings with others y'know? Do you think keeping it all to yourself is doing you any good?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: You let that status of yours go to your head, huh? Afraid to show weakness? That's why you're keeping so much bottled up inside, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: This isn't the Overworld. We don't do envy and etiquette down here. Whatever's on your mind, you can say it.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...I just want to be clear in myself, first. These fragments of history, the teachings I studied... It's all muddled together in my mind... I just... I don't know what I should believe.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: ...No, you just have to be clear on what you should do.
[To Rot or to Burn][Seele]: You've spent long enough living in lies, Bronya. This is your chance to break out of the cage.
[To Rot or to Burn][Bronya]: ...
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: How's it going, partner? Is that feelign in your chest the thrill of victory or just the joy of making it out alive?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: I know, your heart is bursting with gratitude... but there's no need to thank me. We have what I'd like to call a "fiscal friendship." If the money's right, not a problem in sight!
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: When did you call in for reinforcements?
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Ha, I knew that you'd get yourselves into trouble eventually, so I got Oleg to send relief in advance. Pretty sensible, right?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: I'm asking why you went behind our backs.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: My assignment was simply to take you to Svarog's lair. I got the payment and delivered the goods — I wasn't obligated to tell you about my dinner plans!
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: But I threw in something extra regardless. I only did that because we're friends, or I would've charged extra.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Nice work, you saved us.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: My pleasure! Friends should look out for each other. Good for business.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Here's a slice of life experience for you: Resourceful businessmen never get into risky trading without a plan b... and a plan b for their plan b. Plan c, we call that.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: You seem to enjoy muddying the waters.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Hey now, you've got me all wrong! I just enjoy watching people fight, that's all. Fierce words, fists flying... what's not to like?
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Thank you, Sampo.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Easy there, don't get mushy on me now. We professional types don't have time for "thank yous." It's business! Feelings don't come into it.
[To Rot or to Burn][Sampo]: Hahaha~ you see? Gotcha! Hah, seriously though — Sampo will always be happy to assist you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: The Furnace Core... The path to the surface is close at hand now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Thank you, . What you've done has brought new hope to the Underworld. Now we have to wait and see... But maybe this will lead to a new lease on life.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Your support came at the right moment. Thank you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Well, you should really be thanking Sampo. If it weren't for his intel, we wouldn't have made it in time.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: When did doctors start carrying weapons around?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: ...I, um... I haven't been truthful with you...
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: As Wildfire's leader, I couldn't simply look on while you fought on our behalf. We had to come help.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Huh...? Huh!? So, you're the real chief? Wh—What about Oleg?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Oleg has always acted on my behalf — he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the Underworld.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Thanks to him, I'm able to make time for the people. I do my best to make sure that they have everything they need... At the same time, I was formulating a plan to deal with Svarog.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe... and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: You're welcome, all in a day's work for a hero.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: When the Underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: We did it for us, it wasn't as selfless as you made out.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: A person is defined by their actions alone... I think that's how the saying goes? If the Underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Any chance of a more... tangible show of thanks?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: You have Wildfire's full support.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: However, even though Svarog is no longer sealing off the Furnace Core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: That cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. If she detects any change in the Underworld, I don't know what she might resort to...
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: As for Wildfire, we need more time to build up our strength.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: With things as they are, you want to take a back seat?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: No, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. In the meantime, I'm sending someone I trust to go with you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: It will be difficult for us to defeat the guardian alone.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Of course, there's no doubt about that. So, I'll be sending someone I trust to go with you.
[To Rot or to Burn][March 7th]: Seele...
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Didn't she tell you? In private, she insisted on accompanying you.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Don't let her carefree nature fool you — she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker — she takes decisive action. She'll definitely be able to help you. Not to mention... you also have Bronya now.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Will she stand with us...?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: It seems like the intel we got from Svarog caused her a significant shock... but with Seele by her side, I know she'll recover.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: She got a big shock.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: You're right, but with Seele by her side, I know she'll recover.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: , when's the last time you got some rest? I heard that you've been on your feet looking for Svarog since Rivet Town.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Health is everything — you won't be much use if you neglect yours. Let Wildfire take care of the Furnace Core for now. You head back and recuperate.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: If you're lucky... perhaps tomorrow you can return to the Overworld.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Take a good rest while you still can, . Your adventures on the surface won't be easy-going.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: So you're the leader of Wildfire.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Don't be surprised. My job is just to help everyone make the right calls.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: You remember Rivet Town? When the Fragmentum corrosion first appeared, we were defenseless. We didn't have a clue how to protect our homes.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: After we fled to Boulder Town, I made up my mind: A tragedy like that could never be allowed to happen again. That's why I gathered Oleg and the others together, and created the first sparks of Wildfire.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Afterwards, Wildfire began to grow. To be honest, I never thought a day like this would come.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: Your "gentle doctor" act is pretty good!
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: What do you mean? That's me too, y'know. The "me" that my patients see, at least.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Our identities are like masks. When we switch between them, we change the way the world perceives us.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: But our hearts never change.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: What's Wildfire's plan?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Well, we don't want to act in haste before the situation has stabilized. We need to wait for the right time.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Ten years of being sealed away has sapped the Underworld's vitality. Now that the Furnace Core is no longer blocked off, we need to prioritize the people and replenish our resources.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Wildfire has never been in this for its own gain. Everything we do is for the citizens of the Underworld. That passage is a means to an end, not the end itself.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: What about Clara and Svarog?
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: We'll leave them be... Svarog may have blocked off the Furnace Core, but he's provided shelter to the vagrants from the beginning. An admirable deed.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: There are many homeless people in the Underworld. If they had safety and security, they wouldn't have to struggle to survive.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Wildfire can provide that while Svarog is recovering.
[To Rot or to Burn][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[To Rot or to Burn][Natasha]: Things have settled for now, you should rest while you can.

[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Ahhhh... Well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the Underworld, we can finally look for the Stellaron.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: *sigh* But thinking about it, I feel a bit bad about Clara... We promised her that our talks with Svarog would go peacefully...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Svarog attacked first.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: , you tried your best to persuade him. It's my fault for not preparing better for such a situation in advance.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Sorry, I wasn't able to persuade Svarog...
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: You tried your best, don't blame yourself. I should've considered such a situation in advance. And it was Svarog who attacked first, we didn't have any other choice.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: I forgot to be more diplomatic.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: That certainly isn't our area of strength.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: I didn't mean for you guys to start beating yourselves up over it!
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Look on the bright side — things turned out alright, didn't they? Now everyone knows that the real problem here is the Stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: All in all, the mission is going super smoothly!
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: But we still have a lot left to figure out. For instance...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: ...Where's the Stellaron?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Exactly. We don't even have the Stellaron's coordinates and location.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Cocolia's sudden change in attitude is also very curious.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: ...Why does Cocolia have it in for us?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Exactly. There must be a reason for this sudden change in her attitude.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: And, we still don't have the coordinates and location of the Stellaron.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: ...Who is this Sampo character!?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: ...That's not of foremost concern.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: What's important is that we still don't have the exact location and coordinates of the Stellaron. Nor have we figured out the reason behind Cocolia's sudden change in attitude.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: We still haven't put all of the pieces together...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Actually, I've been having some dreams...
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Dreams?
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Oh, I remember you mentioned something about strange dreams before...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Telling Dan Heng and March 7th about the voices you heard in your recent dreams...
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: ...All three dreams were the same, with Cocolia and that other voice...
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: It would be weird to call it a coincidence.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: I'm wondering if these dreams aren't just random, if there is some meaning behind them... Maybe you're having them because...
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Because of... the Stellaron inside ?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: That's my hunch, but I have no proof.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Well then that's as good as nothing for now... So, what should we do when we get back above ground? After all this talk, we're still back at square one...
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: We solve a puzzle one piece at a time. Let's get some rest. We'll talk to Wildfire tomorrow and get to the bottom of this.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Also, there's still one more key character we haven't talked to yet. Her connection to Cocolia may be the key to cracking this mystery.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: We would like to have a rest.
[Not Good with Farewells][Gertie]: You're back! I've heard from Wildfire that you helped resolve that whole situation with Svarog. Amazing!
[Not Good with Farewells][Gertie]: It must have been exhausting. Please, have some food and get a good night's rest.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: I suppose it would be good to get some sleep...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Actually, I still have a lot of energy.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Over there, see that? That used to be the worst street in Rivet Town... and it's also where I grew up.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: My friends and I used to wander those streets thinking about where to find our next meal. That is, until Chief Oleg got me out and took me to the orphanage.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: There I learned to read and write from Natasha. At the age of 10, I started to patrol the mines with Oleg, occasionally getting into fights with the local thugs...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: ...That sounds nice.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Nice? You being sarcastic with me?
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Oh! No, sorry. Life in the Underworld is difficult, I shouldn't be speaking about it so lightly.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: *sigh* You're always so serious... It really gets on people's nerves sometimes, you know?
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Right... Uh, what I meant was... I kind of envy you, Seele.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: For as long as I can remember, my days have been an endless cycle of studying, etiquette lessons, and training.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Every day all I hear is "Remember who you are, Bronya," "This is against the Architects' Admonishments, Bronya," "Ladies shouldn't use such foul language, Bronya"...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: ...Some may envy this kind of life, but I have felt... trapped. When every choice and every goal has already been made for you... You probably can't imagine how that feels.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: ...No, I can't... But more importantly, what kind of "foul language" were you using?
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: ...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: In the name of the Architects, I shall stick this spear into your nostril!
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Hahaha, that's it? That's nothing. Looks like I'll have to teach you some Underworld slang before you go back.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: No, no, that won't be necessary.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: It'll be better than poking people's nostrils at least...
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: I never thought that I'd be here having a heart-to-heart with the future guardian. As a kid, I didn't meet many people who lived in the Overworld. I only heard stories from the grown-ups and figured you were all just a bunch of cold snobs.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: I've heard from some Silvermane veterans that before the orders were made to seal off the Underworld from the Overworld, there was no difference between the two places. Everybody ate the same food, chatted about the same topics, celebrated the same festivals...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Even though times are different now, things like the joys and sorrows of life, the ties between people... These precious things must certainly still connect us all.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: If there is a way to bridge the gap between the two worlds, we can definitely go back to the time when you and I were not divided. When we could stand side by side against the Eternal Freeze and the Fragmentum.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: ...
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: I'm not like you. I don't have that many grand plans for the future. But... if that's the future you want, I'm willing to build this bridge with you.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Thank you, Seele. Your trust is very important to me.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Speaking of which, what are you going to do next? What Svarog revealed must've made quite an impact, huh...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: ...Yes, I thought I was prepared for anything, but...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: As long as I am the guardian's successor, those truths will come out sooner or later. But why does my mother hide it from me, and why does she want me to hunt down the outsiders who know about the nature of the Stellaron... It just... it doesn't make sense.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: I've thought it over. There's only one thing I can do — go ask her directly.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: You... Hold on, you're not really going, are you? Alone? You can't, this plan is...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: I've already thought it through, Seele. I am Madam Cocolia's daughter. That will never change.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Be it my duties as her heir, or a Silvermane Guard, I must face my problems head-on. Even if...
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Bronya...
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: This is for you, Seele. Please help me pass it on to the outsiders. If... If I'm unable to see you again... They'll know what to do.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: ...Okay, I understand. You've made up your mind, and there's nothing I can say that will change it. But remember this — if you run into trouble, I will come to save you, no matter what.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: Then I'll be waiting for you.
[Not Good with Farewells][Bronya]: So... did you come to this spot when you were a child?
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Of course. I just didn't appreciate how nice it was at the time.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: ...Very nice.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: :
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: :
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Took you long enough sleepy head. We've been waiting all day!
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: I've noticed that our sleep routines don't match up. You either keep getting up in the middle of the night or snoozing away until the day is almost out. Unacceptable. You gotta work on your teamwork!
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: , did you have a dream again last night?
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Not this time.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: ...So that’s why you slept for so long.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: I dreamed that Hook and Pom-Pom got into a squabble.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: ...Huh, that's weird. I bet the conductor won, right?
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: I can't remember.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Oh, that happens to me all the time. It feels like I had a dream, but I can't remember anything about it.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Well then, let's go find Wildfire to discuss our next move and see if they have any new discoveries.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Let's go! I can't wait to finally get back above ground!
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: Oh! Look who's here!
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: It's the bane of Svarog! The big hero of the Underworld — !
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: And the other big heroes, Dan Heng and March 7th!
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Were those lines rehearsed?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Where's Natasha? Is she here?
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: She has a bunch of other things to attend to, so I hope you don't mind talking to this old man instead. I speak on behalf of Natasha.
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: By the way, sorry for keeping that whole thing about her being the actual leader of Wildfire a secret. Hahaha...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: It doesn't matter anyway...
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: I'm glad you don't mind. Natasha is always cautious, but she has no ill intent, as you surely have noticed.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: What ever happened to trust?
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: Hahaha, my apologies. Natasha is always cautious, but she has no ill intent, as you must have noticed.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: I'm not seeing the apology here!
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: Oh, well. I might just be second in command, but I still have a lot of responsibility. I couldn't give Natasha up right when we first met, could I? I had no clue that you bunch would become big heroes of the Underworld.
[Not Good with Farewells][Oleg]: She told me to make sure you return to the Overworld safely. I gave it some thought, and I think the safest way is to ask this fella for help.
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: I brought you down. I can you take you back up! Free of charge, satisfaction guaranteed.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: ...There's no need to knock us out this time, right?
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: Of course not! This time we'll go back through the Furnace Core.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: And why do we need you?
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: Well, for my sparkling companionship of course! ...I jest, I jest! The path has been blocked for over ten years, and very few know how to get through. That's where I come in.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Just tell us the path you used before!
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: That would be... problematic, and dangerous. Trust me, we should go through the Furnace Core.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Oleg, give us someone else!
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: Please, don't be like that. We have so much history together, can't you have a little faith?
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Enough chatter. Just be a good guide!
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Hold on. What about Bronya?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Why isn't she here?
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: She already went back. As you know, she has some things to settle with the Supreme Guardian.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: What? She just ditched us and went back? How could you let her...
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: She's not going to help us?
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: It's not like that! She... just has many responsibilities to bear. I don't completely understand, I trust that she's trying to solve the problem.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: She also has her own plan.
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Exactly, she has a lot of responsibilities. I don't completely understand, but I trust that she's trying to solve the problem.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: She left without Sampo?
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Enough about Sampo! We need him for this trip, and we can still get rid of him after we reach the surface.
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: Miss Seele, I'm still here, you know...
[Not Good with Farewells][Seele]: Oh right, Bronya told me to give you this.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: She left us a letter. Hmm... could this be one of those "open-in-case-of-emergency" letters? I've never gotten one of those before. Should we wait until we run into something dangerous?
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Stop overthinking and just open it.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Letter From Bronya
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: , March, Dan Heng:
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: By the time you read this letter, I should have returned to the Overworld and be on my way to see my mother. I apologize for not telling you of my plan. I was afraid that you would strongly object, which might sway my resolve.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Madam Cocolia raised me up, and I will never be able to repay her kindness. She taught me countless life lessons and virtues, as well as how to defend Belobog and its people. Even though she has lately made certain decisions that puzzled me, I can't let go of all the precious memories I have with her. I must communicate my point of view and thoughts to her honestly, and seek to arrive at a mutual understanding with her — this is my goal as a daughter, but also my duty as a Silvermane Guard.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: But I'm aware of the risks I might face on this journey. So, if I fail to win my mother's approval—or if something happens to me—please forward this letter to the Landau siblings and ask for their help. Serval and Gepard are honorable people with enormous power in Belobog, and I have complete faith in them. I'm sure they will unreservedly help you in your search for the Stellaron once they see my seal and handwriting.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Bronya Rand
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Brother and sister Landau...? I know the brother must refer to Gepard, but who could the sister be...
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Oh, Serval! So she's Gepard's older sister!
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: How very astute of you.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Blonde, tall, good-looking... *sigh* Those Landau genes sure are something else.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: I hope nothing happens to Bronya.
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: She gave it some good thought, but whatever's going on in that supreme guardian's head... Even Bronya might have trouble understanding.
[Not Good with Farewells][Narration]: Maybe the "sister" refers to Gepard.
[Not Good with Farewells][March 7th]: Hey, stay on track!
[Not Good with Farewells][Dan Heng]: Sampo, do you know the Landau siblings?
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: Landau... Uhh yeah, we're old friends. I've mostly dealt with the younger brother in the past, but the sister... *shudder* She's much scarier. Today's supposed to be a day of celebration, so let's not talk about it right now.
[Not Good with Farewells][Sampo]: We can set out at any time. Just come find me when you're ready~

[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: You ready yet? If you want to keep wasting time, I'll just go on ahead by myself.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: What, still something you want to talk about? Alright, let's make it quick.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Did Bronya say anything to you?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Not much. We just chatted a bit.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Care to elaborate?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: ...It really isn't worth going into.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: I promised her that I would help her rebuild the connection between the Overworld and the Underworld, that's all.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: I can tell something's weighing on your mind...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: ...Is it that obvious?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: I made a promise to Bronya that if something were to happen to her, I'd rescue her myself.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Looking forward to this journey?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Hmm... I didn't really give it much thought. But traveling with you bunch does always lead to unexpected surprises.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Hearty combat and exciting adventures... Not bad, I certainly don't hate it.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Have you said goodbye to everyone?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Of course... Heh, you didn't see the look on Joshua's face. He could barely hold back his tears.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Chief Oleg... He didn't say much, but I know he's not the kind to wear his heart on his sleeve.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: It was my choice to go up, and Natasha supported my decision. Besides, you could use another person who can fight, right?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: That's all for now.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Alright, then let's cut the chat and move out!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: Ah, young . I wanted to see you off, but you know how things are around here in the underground. Solve one problem and three more take its place.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: Hm, something you wanted to ask?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: About you and Natasha...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: Natasha trusts me. In her eyes, an ex-military officer was more suited to be the leader of the organization than a doctor.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: But the most important thing a leader needs is a strong heart. An ability to unite everyone toward a common cause. In that respect, no one in the underground comes close to her.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: I heard you came from the Overworld.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: I was actually once an officer of the Silvermane Guards. After being discharged due to an injury, I followed my old lady here to the Underworld, where I planned to retire.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: But as things would have it, I ended up busier than ever.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Do you regret it?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: There is nothing to regret! Life in the Underworld is hard, but people here are kind and everyone is close like one big family.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Do you miss the old days in the Overworld?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: Do I miss it? If you're talking about the time with my comrades-in-arms, of course. But other than that, I don't really prefer it over life in the Underworld.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: What's next for Wildfire?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: Wildfire has already made it through its darkest days. With Natasha's leadership, we have the confidence to lead the Underworlders to a brighter future.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: And much of that is thanks to all of you.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: Fortunately, Svarog turned out to have some useful information for you. After all your hard work, I'd feel quite guilty if you left empty-handed. Hahaha!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Oleg]: While you still have a long journey ahead, I have no doubt our paths will cross again one day. Till we meet again, friends of Wildfire!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: Well my friends, are you ready to head out?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Let's go.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: Wonderful! Remember to bring enough food and drink to refuel on the way. We have a lot of steps to climb!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Hold on, I have a question.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: Ask away, my friend. I have all the answers you seek.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Tell me about Gepard Landau.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: What else is there to say? You know him as well as I do. He's an upstanding guy, as well as young, handsome, and charming in his lack of charm.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: But to be honest, I'm not very close to him. After all, he's an officer and I'm... the opposite.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Tell me about Serval Landau.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: Oh, she's quite extraordinary. The renowned rebellious Landau girl. She once had a bright future, but after getting on her leader's bad side, she lost her job. She ended up opening a workshop and playing underground music.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: I heard that her old man was furious, and that only a few younger siblings are still in contact with her.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: I used to go to her sometimes when I had any mechanical problems above ground. But for... various reasons, I don't visit her workshop much anymore.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Tell me about the Furnace Core.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: It's a passage connecting the Underworld and the Overworld, a big, stone, spiral stairway. Y'know, I don't understand the Architects' obsession with making these steps when there is such advanced technology available. Wouldn't an elevator have been better?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: ...It's easier for you youngsters. For this old guy, the steps of the Furnace Core are a nightmare on the knees!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Tell me about yourself.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: You haven't heard enough about me, huh? Alright, my name is Sampo Koski. I'm a businessman who stands up for justice in his free time. And no, I don't have it in for you.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: There's still unfinished business here.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Sampo]: What's the matter? Got too attached to the underground? Go ahead, I'll be waiting here.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: Mother, I have returned.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: Bronya! I thought... I thought I'd lost you.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: Where were you? A—Are you hurt? I'll fetch the butler right away—
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: No, there's no need! I don't want to see Sebas right now. Sorry, mother...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: I'm fine, really. I just got into a few skirmishes down in the Underworld, but nothing I couldn't handle.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: The Underworld? Oh... I see.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: In that case, report everything you saw, Commander Bronya.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: After the failed pursuit at Backwater Pass, the wanted outsiders and I were somehow taken to the Underworld.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: Because of the difficult situation we were in, we formed a temporary alliance to help the residents of the Underworld resolve a few... issues of survival.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: We also defeated an ancient robot known as "Svarog," and learned some truths... about the Stellaron.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: ...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: ...I'm listening. Go on.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: Madam Cocolia, it is my firm belief that the visitors from beyond the sky are not the villains we had imagined before.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: I witnessed them take up arms in the name of justice, and risk their lives for the sake of others. I can also ascertain that they did come for the Stellaron, but only to relieve the disaster it has brought upon Belobog.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: Mother... you've always known the truth about the Stellaron, haven't you? The responsibility of bearing that truth will fall upon me one day. Such is the burden of being guardian — to carry these secrets for eternity.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: So... I ask you to forgive my defiance, but I believe that the order to dispatch the outsiders was a mistake. To solve the problems brought on by the Stellaron, the Architects waited hundreds of years, and those outsiders may be the... the—
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: Enough!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: ...!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: Arrogant, ignorant... Oh you disappoint me, Bronya.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: You merely glimpsed the tip of the iceberg and now you think you know everything. You spend a short time with that Underworld scum, and suddenly you have the audacity to question my orders?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: Guards! Take Bronya—
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: —They are not scum!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: My entire life, everything you ever kept from me... I remember it clearly now. This time... this time I'm standing my ground, Madam Guardian! And please, stop dismissing me with vague excuses.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: Tell me what you have seen. What exactly it is you are hiding... Why do you send the Silvermane Guards to die in the Fragmentum? Why have you abandoned the people of the Underworld? And why... why did you have that sudden change of mind?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: ...I see.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: I knew this moment would come sooner or later... I just didn't expect it would be so soon.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: You want to know why I gave those orders... is that right? Do you believe you are ready to learn the truth?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Bronya]: Yes. I am ready... Mother.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: Then come with me, Bronya.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Cocolia]: It is time you heard it... the voice of this dying world.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][???]: Come... Come...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Ah, we're finally back! ...I forgot what fresh air tasted like... Nom, nom, nom.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Where do we go now?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Wait! I haven't finished yet... Alright, let's go.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: What flavor is it?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: ...Freedom... Cold... Mainly cold actually. Let's go.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Aren't we missing something?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: No.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Where's Sampo...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Nope. Next question.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Where's our next stop? We should find somewhere to put our feet up, as long as it's not Goethe Hotel again...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Classic unreliable Sampo — he probably guessed we'd ask where his hiding place was. No sooner are we back in the Administrative District than he sneaks off.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: We should hide in plain sight. To the hotel!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: No way! The boss will recognize us, plus Silvermane Guards are stationed nearby. We'd be offering ourselves up on a silver platter!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: A friend in need is a friend indeed. Let's find Landau!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: The bro or the sis? If you're talking about Gepard, we should be careful... He's a top Silvermane Guard — he'd probably get a medal for every one of us he brought in.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Home is where the heart is. Back to the Express!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Where's your sense of loyalty!? Uh, that would be nice though...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Dan Heng, what do you think?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: I think it'd be best to pay a visit to Serval Landau.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: So you think we should avoid Gepard for the time being, right?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: He's an elite officer of the Silvermane Guards. It wouldn't be easy to get to him. Besides... if he hasn't been persuaded by Bronya's letter, we'd be walking right into the lion's den.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Hmm, makes sense... Guess we better head over to Serval's workshop then?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: Mm. But... we must keep a low profile — we're still wanted fugitives.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: What's wrong, Seele?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: Nothing, it's just a little... new.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: The last time I was on the surface, I was still a child. I have no memory of any of this.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: The Overworld and the Underworld... We've... We've been cut off for so long.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: I'm okay. Let's go.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: There are so many Silvermane Guards on patrol. Is it usually like this?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: No, I don't remember the security being this tight last time... It might have something to do with us.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: The supreme guardian has probably learned of our arrival already. Bronya...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Who is it? Shop's closed today, you'll have to come back tomorrow!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: It's the radiator fixers.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Hah...?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: It's a big customer with bigger pockets!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Ha, not interested — I need time, not money!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Serval! We came past here before and helped you fix a few things, remember?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: What...?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Ah, I remember! The three outsiders! Wait — why are you still strolling around the city? Do you know the Silvermane Guards are looking all over for you?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Quick, act natural and get inside. Don't get spotted!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Alright, you'll be safe here. My workshop has pretty good soundproofing, and barely anyone comes in.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Just what crime did you commit exactly? They recalled a bunch of Guards from the front line to track you down — it's unprecedented. Now they're patrolling the whole city and everyone's in a panic.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Oh, we just—
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: Not yet, March.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: Bronya said we could trust you completely.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: You mean to say that you don't trust me completely?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Good! That's smart of you. But you needn't worry, Cocolia and I aren't even on speaking terms. It was her that ejected me from the Architects — I refuse to stand with her.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I don't believe you guys would do anything bad, and the Architects are gonna need conclusive and publicly available evidence for me to think otherwise. Besides, I know the Architects, and if they did have any evidence, they would've released it by now.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I know Cocolia's style — get everyone into a frenzy first.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: ...Most people in a frenzy don't stop to ponder the details.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Do you know Cocolia well?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Hehe, you could say that... We were like sisters once — inseparable. Of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: So what details have you been pondering?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Me? None. What Cocolia and the Architects get up to has nothing to do with me. My time is too precious for pondering.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Do you dislike Cocolia?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Dislike? We were like sisters once — inseparable. Of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: These days I just spend my time fixing things in this workshop and playing music. It's a pretty carefree existence.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: *sigh* If I'm not careful I'll start boring you all with sob stories from the past. Let's get back to you guys. If long-lost Bronya told you to come here, you must have something important to tell me?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: You can trust me. I know our paths have only crossed once before, but my intuition tells me you guys are good people. And I've got good intuition by the way, haha.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: We may as well tell the long and short of it from start to finish.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Ooh! I'm the best storyteller — let me! Let me!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: ...Try not to embellish the facts.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: We may as well cut to the chase and make a long story short.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Ooh! I'm the best storyteller — let me! Let me!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: ...Perhaps I should do it, or we'll still be here tomorrow.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Telling Serval about your time in the Underworld and what you know about the Stellaron, and showing her Bronya's letter...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: So that's what's been happening — no wonder we hadn't heard from Bronya recently. *sigh* After all these years in isolation and without a single word from below, this is what's become of the Underworld...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I believe you, there's no way you could have invented all those twists and turns. What's more, we have Miss Seele here as living proof. As for the Stellaron... heh, I know why Bronya got you to find me.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: ...When I was still one of the Architects working in the Scientific Research Division, I was researching the Stellaron.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I never thought I'd hear that word again after being expelled by the Architects... Come on, I'll tell you everything.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Only a very few people in Belobog know of the existence of the Stellaron. Those that do would never associate it with the Fragmentum or Eternal Freeze.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: But according to the data recorded in that robot, Svarog... the Architects dug out the truth long ago. The research results were purposely hidden away to ensure that the outside world would never know of them.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Just my luck... Out of all the research topics I could've chosen, I insisted on the Stellaron. It's clear now that anyone who wanted to get closer to the truth would have been expelled or "abandoned."
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Maybe I should be thanking Cocolia. All she did was push me out... She could've decided to take a more permanent measure.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: How much do you know about the Stellaron?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I figured out that the Stellaron and the Fragmentum were linked, so I was already close to the truth. It's a shame that the Architects ejected me before I could discover that the source of the Fragmentum was the Stellaron itself.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Before I lost my position, I was applying for permission to survey the Stellaron directly. It was my research topic, but I'd never even set eyes on it. My research was all based on historical data and lab simulations.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Not long after I submitted my preliminary report and application, I received my punishment. It was obvious that somebody didn't want my research to continue.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Do you know what Cocolia's end goal is?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Cocolia... It's been so many years since we last spoke. We were great friends once — there was nothing we wouldn't share.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: She became a completely different person when she took on the supreme guardianship. The convictions she once held, her enthusiasm... it was like they were drawn out of her by some mysterious force.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: She gave the order to expel me herself and refused to see me... I never understood that behavior, and I gave up trying to use logic to work it out a long time ago.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Sometimes I even wonder whether she really did become a different person... is that possible? Perhaps there's a single guardian's consciousness that gets handed down from generation to generation... and the real Cocolia has already vanished.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Is she being compelled by previous generations of guardians to make such baffling decisions? Who knows... but this might make for good songwriting material.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Can we talk to Gepard?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Gepard? Not a chance... He's a decent guy, but also famously uncompromising.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: For my brother, orders are more important than anything. Even if you stuck Bronya's letter to his forehead, he wouldn't be swayed.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: You need to choose your words carefully if you want to persuade him of something. It might be best if I talk to him... though I'd need a strategy first.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Do you know where the Stellaron is?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Yes. I never observed it directly, but I used lab simulations and outbound surveys to establish a rough location.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: According to the survey results, the Stellaron is likely to the north of Belobog... somewhere in the vast Snow Plains.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: We must locate it as soon as possible — ideally before Cocolia takes action. Can you tell us the way?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Not a problem, I was thinking the same thing! But I'm afraid telling you might not be enough.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: The area to the north of Belobog has been more or less swallowed up by the Fragmentum. If you want to get to the northern Snow Plains, you'll need to get past the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone on the front lines first.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Even if you get past the restricted zone in one piece... you'll have a whole heap of Fragmentum to deal with.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Yes. That's where the main force of the Silvermane Guards is stationed. They've consolidated their position there in order to resist the encroaching Fragmentum.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: A whole heap of Fragmentum...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Correct. And it's different from the underground towns you described. The Fragmentum there has quite literally torn everything to pieces — there's no sign of life, despite the monsters.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: It sounds like... The three of us and Seele might not be enough. Why don't we go back underground and get Wildfire to come with us?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Dan Heng]: I fear we may not have the time.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Hey, enough pessimism! Back in my "official capacity" days, I spent a lot of time in the north — I got to know the soldiers and officers on the front line very well.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: This calls for brainwaves, not "brawnwaves." How about I take you over myself?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Really? Great! Phew, it's less scary if someone you know is leading the way!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Haha, I wanna see the Stellaron too, y'know — it was my research topic for over a decade. You don't get that many decades in life.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: That's settled then! There's no time to lose — we should head out as soon as you're ready.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: D—Darn it! I forgot my brother said he'd be around today...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Find somewhere to hide — quick — I'll handle him!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: G—Gepard, it's you! I didn't think you'd have the time to visit with things so tense on the front line, hehe...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: Things are manageable, the latest wave of monster attacks has slowed. I'm back in the city to take care of a few matters, but I'll be back on the front line later... I thought I told you?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Ah? Oh, yes, that's right...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: ...Sis, you look a bit pale. Did something happen?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: N—No, why would anything have happened?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: You don't normally use my full name.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: *sigh* You said you hate it when I call you "bro" in public! Well I agree. It'd sound better if I started using your full name. Right, broseph?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: ...You can call me whatever you like. Look Serval, I'm here on official business today. There's something wrong with the Barrier Generator Device and the engineers in our unit don't know how to fix it. I need you to take a look.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Those guys can't think outside the box. Of course they can't wrap their heads around my design. *sigh* I thought it was something big. Leave it here. I'll take a look.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: Sorry to trouble you.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Why are you being so polite? Oh, and why's the city under curfew all of a sudden? Has something happened?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: I... I've been instructed to keep it quiet.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Lil' Geppie... So grown up now... Looking down on his civilian sister...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: Don't say that... *sigh* Forget it. If I don't tell you, Pela will...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: Last night, Lady Bronya suddenly appeared. She entered Qlipoth Fort without saying anything to anyone.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: The Supreme Guardian is worried that the three intruders may have followed Bronya out of the Fragmentum and back into the Administrative District. She issued a curfew for the entire city, and ordered us to pursue and capture any suspicious individuals.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Ah! So that's how it is, no wonder I haven't heard from Bronya... Is she alright?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: I'm not sure. She hasn't left Qlipoth Fort. The supreme guardian just said she'd returned. Nothing more.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: ...!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Well, I was sure worried about her... After she disappeared, Pela's workload doubled — she said she barely had time to go out.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: She really does tell you everything... Oh, by the way, I left my Goethe Hotel limited-edition flask behind last time I was here. Let me have a look for it. I think I left it over...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: W—Wait!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: What is it? You seem pretty off today, Serval...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: It's, um... right! You remember how you neglected all those flowers to death? I piled them all over there during a bit of spring cleaning, and now they smell terrible! So... don't go over there!
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: ...Seems like a strange reason not to take a look... plus, am I supposed to believe you were spring cleaning? You must be up to more forbidden research...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Am not — how dare you! What do you take your sister for?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: *sigh* Never mind. This is your space, and I shouldn't intrude. I've got business to take care of. Bye for now.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Hey! Wait a sec — uh... Those intruders, I wanted to ask. What crime have they committed?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: They're plotting to overthrow the Architects and bring harm to the city.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Huh... reminds me of the accusations against me. Cocolia's methods haven't changed.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: Don't say that, Serval. I know that you're still nursing a grievance against the supreme guardian, but this isn't a joking matter.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: ...You're telling me off again. Fine, whatever bro. You better be going, come listen to Pela and my next rehearsal.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Gepard]: I will... if I have the time.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: The coast is clear. You can come out now.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Step DescriptionGepard's visit took everyone by surprise. Thanks to Serval's resourcefulness, she was able to persuade her brother to leave and prevent a disaster from happening.You are safe for the time being but will soon be waist-deep in danger again... This time, the destination is a place with the most Silvermane Guards in all of Belobog — the Fragmentum Frontline.No risk, no reward, as they say. If you want to truly dismantle the crisis in front of you, being exposed to danger seems inevitable. Neverwinter Workshop
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][March 7th]: Phew...I nearly suffocated! What kind of plot device was that...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I almost lost my cool when he went for his flask...
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: ...This is bad. Bronya's in danger. We have to go save her.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Attempting to storm Qlipoth Fort by ourselves? Forget it, Seele. I don't care how skilled you are. I'm not sending you on a suicide mission.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Rest assured, Cocolia may have changed over the years... but she'd never hurt Bronya. I'm certain of that.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Seele]: ...You sound like Bronya herself. I don't get it — you guys are against Cocolia, and yet in some ways, you seem to trust her completely.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Have you thought of a way to persuade Gepard?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: I was gauging his reactions just now, did you see? Unless we have irrefutable evidence, he won't question Cocolia's orders. If you go after him now, our plan's as good as over.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Narration]: Is Gepard going to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone?
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Didn't you hear him? He said he needs to take care of a few matters in the city first. If we're fast enough, we can stay out of his way.
[Cleanse in the Darkness Outside][Serval]: Come on, let's go to the restricted zone. If we can get ahead of the curve and find the Stellaron, Cocolia will be out of options.

[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: Is Bronya really safe?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: You care about her, huh. You must have become close friends.
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: Close is... a bit much. But I made her a promise...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Relax, she's the strongest girl I've ever seen.
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: Mm... I can believe that.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: They've jacked up security alright... how the heck are we gonna sneak in? Serval, we need one of those brainwaves.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Leave it to me. Stick close guys, and don't get spotted.
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: This is a military base. Trespassers aren't allowed in.
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: Wait, isn't that... Ah! Serval! Long time no see!
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Well, if it isn't Franz, long time no see! You're still watching the entrance?
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: Well you see, I... Bah, you haven't changed Serval. Still nailing us to the wall...
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: So... what brings you over here at this hour? And who are the guys behind you?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: My brother said the restricted zone energy lines were malfunctioning — told me it was urgent. He doesn't trust those contracted maintenance workers... so he got me in for free.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: These guys are my assistants. We need to overhaul all the installations here.
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: Uh... I didn't hear anything about the energy lines malfunctioning...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Oh please, this is a Technology Division issue. Why would they tell you guys? Come on, let us in already. If the heating system goes down in the middle of the night, are you gonna be responsible for all the frozen corpses?
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: N—No, that's uh, not something I could handle...
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: Seeing as you're Captain Gepard's sister, it should be fine...
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: Okay, here are some temporary passes... Oh, and remember to give them back to me when you leave.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Thanks, Franz. I'll put in a good word for you with my brother and get him to promote you!
[Unattainable Idol][Franz]: No, no, Captain Gepard hates all that under-the-table stuff. I'd have a better chance if you don't mention me at all...
[Unattainable Idol][Guard Captain]: I'm aware that there are those among you who see the reserve units as a vacation. Well let me set one thing straight: You are gravely mistaken!
[Unattainable Idol][Guard Captain]: This is the restricted zone. The Fragmentum before you conceals monsters that watch your every move. Behind us, we have a band of conspirators that have infiltrated the city...
[Unattainable Idol][Guard Captain]: The situation is critical... The lazy and undisciplined among you will lose your lives to the forces surrounding us!
[Unattainable Idol][Guard Captain]: As such, starting from today, we will be adding 200 bench presses and 30 extra minutes of one-arm planks to our daily drill! Is that clear?
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Yes, sir!
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: See! That was easy.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: You're Gepard's sister alright...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Hmph, I don't want people to see me that way... I'm doing this for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't be using my brother's name.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Hmm... Are those... temporary passes?
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: I haven't seen one of those for a long time. Hmm... The restricted zone virtually never allows outsiders in.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Do you see that mechanical gear bridge? When you cross over to the other side, you arrive at hell on earth.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: So what exactly is on the other side?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: An endless Fragmentum, a few exhausted Silvermane Guards... and the stench of death in the air.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: And what's this "hell" like exactly?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Hmm... It's a place too cold to bear, covered in snow and ice. The guys doing the scientific research don't have time to worry about the surroundings.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: The restricted zone front line is on the other side of the gear bridge. It's an endless Fragmentum with a few exhausted Silvermane Guards... and the stench of death in the air.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: The Architects follow Qlipoth. Do they believe in hell?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: They do. The Architects believe that hell can exist on any world — a plight that will inevitably come to be without intervention.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: In the future, a terrible catastrophe will arrive. If, under Qlipoth the Preservation's guidance, we fail to construct a barrier, that catastrophe will sweep away the stars, plunging all worlds into hell.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: That's the belief of the Architects... but for us, hell is an endless Fragmentum, a few exhausted Silvermane Guards... and the stench of death in the air.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: If we want to progress further north, we will need to cross that hell. Are you ready?
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: We've come this far...
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Exactly, we've got nowhere left to retreat.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Without hardships to overcome, there is no trailblazing.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Right on! I'm stealing that!
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: It's never too late to retreat...
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Look how far we've come! Don't chicken out on us now.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Haha, let's go then. First, we need to think of a way to get to the other side.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I helped set the underlying mechanisms for this type of gear bridge. It's controlled via different terminals in combination. Let's go find them.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Is Gepard on front line duty a lot?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Yes, but what made you ask that all of a sudden?
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: It's so dangerous, don't you worry about him?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: He's a Landau.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: ...Mechanical Fever released a new song. Did you hear it?
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Sure did, Pela was on lead vocals this time, scared me half to death. It's a completely different style.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Even Mechanical Fever is changing... *sigh* Rock 'n' roll's dead, there's no audience anymore.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Don't be so pessimistic. They're just keeping things fresh. I thought Pela was pretty good.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Argh...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Nope... this terminal is offline, we can't control it from here.
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: So what's the plan?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Look for another — every platform linked to the gear bridge should have a similar terminal.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: I never would've guessed that Gepard and you were brother and sister.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I can't say I blame you — we're nothing alike in personality or interests.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: In our family we have a strong military tradition going back generations — many a Landau has died in their prime. There's not a lot of "brother and sister time." Everyone just does their best to get on with their life.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: ...Darn, can't activate it. It seems like someone's severed the energy supply to the terminals.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: So someone's deliberately trying to create trouble?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I... huh. Y'know, the more I think about it, the more it seems deliberate.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Are the Guards doing this intentionally?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I was just thinking that, we can't rule it out.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Did we do this?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: What are you talking about...?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I think the Guards must have done this intentionally.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: With the front line on high alert, they must have rotated the bridge to make it impassable. Then they cut off the energy supply to the terminals to avoid accidental repositioning... or to prevent deserters from escaping.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: That way, even if the front line were to collapse... the Fragmentum monsters wouldn't be able to make it to the other side.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: They cut off their only retreat...
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: That's terrible.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Wise tactics.
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: ...
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: Bronya was right... The Silvermane Guards really are risking their lives to protect Belobog.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Just my conjecture, but I doubt it's far from the truth. My brother mentioned that they've had to use extreme measures to repel the Fragmentum monsters.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Let's press on. We can't activate either of these terminals, so let's look for the energy supply installation itself.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Aren't you the maintenance people? What are you doing over here?
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: You can't just go wherever you please in the restricted zone! Get to work!
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: You, hold it right there!
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: This is a military base. Temporary workers aren't allowed in.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Hmm-hmm... Did you hear Mallick is being reassigned? It seems like both the front line and the city are shorthanded right now.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Seriously? No way. I thought Mallick had only just been promoted?
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Mysterious. It feels like something big's about to go down.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: As long as it's away from the front line, I'd happily be reassigned... It's only been a year since I enlisted — I'm not ready to lose my life.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Ahh, you make it sound terrible. Good luck "preserving" anything with those idlers in the reserve units. Our purpose as Silvermane Guards is to protect the citizens of Belobog.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: Sorry, I'm on duty, no time to chat.
[Unattainable Idol][Guard]: If there's an issue, report to the security captain.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: That's it! The thing shaped like a giant iron ball.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: And it's behind a gate. What are the odds...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Its formal name is the "mechanism energy hub." It's connected to all the energy lines — I would've thought it covers the entire restricted zone.
[Unattainable Idol][Dan Heng]: Mm... no wonder it's so heavily guarded.
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: One unit for everything? That's a disaster waiting to happen — we learned the hard way.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: As long as we can gain access permissions to the hub, we can operate the gear bridge terminals.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Won't this cause a commotion...?
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Won't the Guards get suspicious?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: That's why I told them we were here for urgent maintenance! The front line equipment needs servicing just as much as the rest.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: So that's why you went for maintenance, way to go Serval! I thought you just came up with it on the spot.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Come on, let's see if that guard over there will let us past.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Yo! Evening, soldier!
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: Are you the emergency engineers? I saw you guys hanging around. Did you find the problem?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Not yet, everything looks normal so far. I think the problem is stemming from the energy hub.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: If you let us in we can do a routine service inspection... I've worked on various iterations of this type of installation...
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: Haha, no, no, no, no... No can do! No one gets near the energy hub without the security captain's encryption key.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Uh, not even the supreme guardian?
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: The supreme guardian...? Hey, no games, y'hear? No dice without the encryption key!
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Darn, this guy's not stupid...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: You need the encryption key, right? Which captain should I bother then?
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: ...Captain Dunn's resting up ahead. Go and find him. If he grants you permission, I won't stand in your way.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Dunn... Dunn? Ha, why didn't you say so! No problem. We'll be back in a bit.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Serval, this Dunn, do you know him?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: You bet I do. We go way back. He's easy to talk to. Watch me persuade him.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Hey, Dunn! It's been a while. I didn't know you made security captain.
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: S—Serval, it's been a long time... you're still so... Ahem. You look good.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Allow me to introduce my assistants to you. They help me take care of business at the workshop.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Everyone, this is Captain Dunn, an old friend of mine. He used to be an ace on the keys in the band.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Oh? You play rock 'n' roll too? Cool!
[Unattainable Idol][Dan Heng]: Pleased to meet you.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Great seeing you.
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Oh, hello...
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: *sniff* What's that weird smell...
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Something smells weird...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Hmm? *cough* Zackery, how many days has it been since you showered?
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: Uh... I showered right before my shift—
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Hmm? What did you say?
[Unattainable Idol][Silvermane Guard]: ...I—I haven't showered in two days, sir!
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Unacceptable, especially in front of visitors! Apologies for the embarrassment, all.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: It's not a big deal, Dunn. Y'know, if you get a chance, would you wanna get on stage with us again?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: My keyboard guy is pretty good, but I still miss our military days playing in the band...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: That was a long time ago, Serval — I haven't touched a keyboard in ages. Besides, I'm stationed here all year round, I'm afraid I don't get many chances to return to the city.
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Though I don't stand on ceremony... How may I assist you. If everything's in order, you'd better head back to the city. It's not safe here.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I've checked the lines, there don't seem to be any major problems. All that's left is the energy hub.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: The guard over there said that I needed an "encryption key" to open the gate. Can you help me out?
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: ...
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: We'll be on our way after we run a check-up.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Don't be hesitant in front of your dream girl.
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: Could you be any less discreet!?
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: ...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Anything wrong, Dunn?
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Sorry, Serval... but can you tell me what Captain Gepard told you?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Huh? Oh, uh... Let me think... "Hey, sis, the energy supply lines in the restricted zone have malfunctioned. Those useless engineers can't find the problem." Something like that...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: And may I ask... when did he contact you?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Uh... this morning?  Yeah, that's right. He's on urban patrol duty today, right? That's why he popped round and asked the favor.
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: ...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Captain Gepard just returned to the frontline. I could... reconfirm with him?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: ...Hah? Hold up, he's back? That can't be, he was still in the city a little while ago...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: *sigh* You haven't changed Serval... You're still a lousy liar.
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: These people you've brought, they're... they're not workshop assistants, right?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: ...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Serval, it's not that I don't want to help you... but you should remember that I'm a Belobog Silvermane Guard!
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: How about this. You can leave and I won't tell anyone about this incident... But the outsiders must remain.
[Unattainable Idol][Dan Heng]: There goes the negotiation.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Serval, you should go.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Sorry for getting you involved in this.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Looks like this is gonna end in a fight after all.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I brought you guys here, and I'm standing with you till the end!
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Dunn, this concerns the fate of Belobog — no — the fate of our whole world. Please don't stand in our way...
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Serval! We used to rehearse together every day. You must understand?
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: My rock 'n' roll soul is to uphold the dignity of a soldier!
[Unattainable Idol][Dunn]: Serval... why...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: I'm sorry Dunn... Time for a little nap.
[Unattainable Idol][Dan Heng]: He's just unconscious. Don't worry.
[Unattainable Idol][Seele]: Stubborn fool... strong, though. Wildfire lacks people like him.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Got it, the encryption key! Quick, before we attract attention, let's—
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: I think we attracted attention...
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: That's the enemy attack alarm... Every Silvermane Guard in the reserve zone just became our enemy.
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: Come on, let's take them out!
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: If we work together we can break through their ranks!
[Unattainable Idol][Narration]: My life was short, but it was a life filled with—
[Unattainable Idol][March 7th]: You're not dead yet. How can you give up that easily!?
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: We've made it up till now... I could lose an arm and a leg for all I care — I have to lay eyes on the Stellaron.
[Unattainable Idol][Serval]: Quick, back to the energy supply hub. Anyone that tries to stop us is gonna find out a thing or two.

[Young Guard][Seele]: If I'd known he had the encryption key from the start, I could've snuck in and taken it off him myself.
[Young Guard][Serval]: Shoulda, coulda, woulda, Seele! Activating the gear bridge alone would've been enough to expose us.
[Young Guard][Serval]: We're in!
[Young Guard][March 7th]: It's open! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, Dunn!
[Young Guard][Serval]: Give me some time...
[Young Guard][Serval]: Ugh, who designed this operating system! It's so unintuitive!
[Young Guard][Serval]: Emergency Fire Evacuation System... Not that...
[Young Guard][Serval]: Rock 'n' Roll Dance Floor Atmosphere Mode... Who the heck added that!? And they used one of my songs!
[Young Guard][Serval]: Gear Bridge Control Terminal — ha, still found it!
[Young Guard][Serval]: That's it, I've reset the energy system! Let's go and operate the gear bridge terminal.
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Um, Serval... won't more Silvermane Guards be waiting for us on the other side of the gear bridge?
[Young Guard][Serval]: Yup.
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Then what's our plan!?
[Young Guard][Serval]: Well, either we reason with them or charge straight through the blockade... Let's play it by ear!
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Uhh...
[Young Guard][Seele]: Careful! There's a big guy up ahead.
[Young Guard][Serval]: There's no other way... We'll have to fight.
[Young Guard][Seele]: Hmph, if we can beat Svarog, we can beat this one. Let's go!
[Young Guard][Serval]: Energy restored... system online... certification enabled... come on, come on!
[Young Guard][Serval]: 40%... 65%... 85%...
[Young Guard][Serval]: Phew! We did it! We've gained access to the gear bridge. Let's move.
[Young Guard][Serval]: Perfect! Okay, we need to get to the front line.
[Young Guard][Dan Heng]: ...We could have a problem. Your brother may be there.
[Young Guard][Serval]: He probably is... Hopefully, we don't bump into him, but if we do, we'll just have to try and talk to him...
[Young Guard][Dan Heng]: Are you sure you can convince him?
[Young Guard][Serval]: I've probably got a 30% chance, or less.
[Young Guard][Dan Heng]: ...Meaning it could end in a fight.
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Haven't you noticed yet? Most of our "convincing" ends in a fight.
[Young Guard][Dan Heng]: We need to be sure, Serval. If we can't reach a common understanding with your brother... will you stand with us?
[Young Guard][Serval]: ...Of course. My word is my bond. I said that I'd stand with you to the end, and I won't go back on that promise.
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Before our next expedition, I need Himeko to teach me some negotiation skills. Beating people up all the time is cramping my elegance!
[Young Guard][Serval]: I haven't fought with Gepard since he enlisted. He could never beat me when we were little, but now...
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Serval... it really is you.
[Young Guard][Serval]: Wait, Gepard! Listen to me—
[Young Guard][Gepard]: When the sentry reported to me, I thought there must have been a misunderstanding. The enemy alarm had to be unrelated to your entry into the restricted zone — perhaps the intruders had taken you hostage. And yet...
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Step away from the intruders, Serval. Walk over slowly and stand behind me. You're different from them.
[Young Guard][Serval]: I'm sorry... we have an understanding. I stand with them.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...
[Young Guard][Serval]: Give me a few minutes, just few. I'll explain every—
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Enough, Serval!
[Young Guard][Serval]: ...!
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Have you forgotten where we are? We Landaus ought to know this place better than anywhere... The outer reaches of the front line against the Fragmentum, Belobog's most strategic protective fortress.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Every Silvermane Guard here, every person here, is ready to sacrifice themselves, ready to spill their blood for Belobog at a moment's notice...
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Yet here you are leading fugitives into the restricted zone, attacking my Silvermane comrades-in-arms, hijacking the energy hub... Are you really worthy of the Landau name?
[Young Guard][Serval]: Why do you think I've come here? We've found a way to dispel the Eternal Freeze, to seal the Fragmentum. It might be the only lifeline this world has left!
[Young Guard][Gepard]: If that were true, why wouldn't you report to Madam Cocolia? Why would you sneak into the restricted zone and create chaos!?
[Young Guard][Serval]: You don't understand. The one preventing us from getting close to the truth... is Cocolia herself.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...You have all seen the supreme guardian in person. Do you think you can act as you please because she didn't recognize your version of events!?
[Young Guard][Serval]: Listen to me, Gepard! The origin and spread of the Fragmentum is linked to the Stellaron. The meteorite in the Architects' records, it's—
[Young Guard][Gepard]: I know about the Stellaron. It's exactly what the fugitives behind you are seeking. But the Madam Guardian has already revealed the truth to me! These people have ulterior motives, Serval. They want to steal this treasure from the Architects.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: The Madam Guardian has warned me before that you were indulging in fantasy, that you'd been exposed to forbidden knowledge, and that you would bring destruction down upon Belobog... I believe you, Serval, I believe you think you're acting with loyalty to the people! It's just...
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Guards, formation! Arrest these people. We could be inundated with Fragmentum monsters at any moment, we have no time to waste on them!
[Young Guard][Serval]: The forbidden is only forbidden to conceal the truth within.
[Young Guard][Serval]: Cocolia's afraid that we'll seize on this knowledge — that the truth will spread far and wide: To save the world, we must risk it all.
[Young Guard][Serval]: I've said my piece, whether you believe it or not is up to you. Regardless, you should know by now your sister's never been one to back down. If there's something or someone you can't abide, you should stand up and resist... and if there's something you uphold, you should uphold it to the very end!
[Young Guard][Narration]: Well said, Serval!
[Young Guard][Narration]: Think thrice, Gepard!
[Young Guard][Narration]: What happened to brainwaves!?
[Young Guard][Gepard]: Save your explanation for the judge. You are charged with sabotaging the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. In my capacity as captain, I hereby order that these fugitives be arrested!
[Young Guard][Gepard]: This isn't like our childhood games, Serval. You won't get any leniency from me.
[Young Guard][Serval]: The Barrier hasn't been fixed yet. Don't try and be a hero, Gepard!
[Young Guard][March 7th]: ...Ugh, didn't I tell you? All our negotiations end in combat!
[Young Guard][Narration]: )
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...
[Young Guard][Seele]: This guy... knows how to put up a fight. I've never come up against anyone this relentless!
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Phew... he just won't go down...
[Young Guard][Serval]: He's as stubborn as I am. It could be an argument or a fight — he'll do both to the death... That's why he bugs the heck out of me!
[Young Guard][Serval]: That's enough, Gepard. Take a look around you! You're the last man standing!
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...Even if I am, I won't yield...
[Young Guard][Narration]: We don't need you to yield.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Please yield already.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Brainwaves? Anyone?
[Young Guard][Dan Heng]: We don't want you to yield through force of arms. That wouldn't be a victory for us.
[Young Guard][March 7th]: Yeah, our goal is the same as yours, Serval's, and Bronya's — we just want to preserve this world! There's no reason to turn against each other!
[Young Guard][Serval]: Gepard... brother. Surely now you can see the need for pragmatism?
[Young Guard][Serval]: Even if you don't believe my outsider friends, you should believe me... Ugh, maybe I've wasted your trust... in which case, believe Bronya.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...Lady Bronya?
[Young Guard][Narration]: You tell Gepard everything you know and show him Bronya's letter.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...
[Young Guard][Serval]: There's nothing more to say, Gepard. The decision is yours.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: As a captain of the Silvermane Guards, I am duty-bound to carry out the orders of the Supreme Guardian.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Final answer...?
[Young Guard][Narration]: We could decide for you.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Fine! I've still got fight in me.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: But... Lady Bronya is the commanding officer for the front lines. According to military protocol, if the front line directives of the commanding officer clash with those of the Architects behind the lines, a soldier must remain at their post and await further directives.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Thanks for understanding.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Is this a brainwave? This feels like a brainwave.
[Young Guard][Narration]: Nice interpretation of the rules, dude.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...
[Young Guard][Gepard]: For the Silvermane Guards, the guardian's orders are paramount and absolute. But there is something of equal importance in the oath we take...
[Young Guard][Serval]: ...The people of Belobog.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: If we lose the people, we lose the reason for our existence. Our fight with the Fragmentum monsters is for the sake of preservation, but our fight with you... I fail to see the purpose.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: If you are truly able to prevent our endlessly unfolding misfortunes, then the people of Belobog are indebted to you.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: But if you are using lies to mask your true intentions, using my sister and Bronya for your own ends... I swear by Qlipoth that I will carry out your punishment without an ounce of mercy.
[Young Guard][Seele]: They're not lying, I promise you.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: You must be Seele? You are a skilled fighter... your combat style is nothing like that of the Guards.
[Young Guard][Seele]: Regardless of what you believe, these guys have been a great help to the Underworld. Many people would vouch for them.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: ...I'm sure.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: If you want to advance further northward, you must traverse an area entirely corroded by the Fragmentum. It's the only way to get to the Snow Plains on the other side.
[Young Guard][Gepard]: The Guards can give you some time before the next wave of attacks is upon us.

[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: I gotta admit, I had a lot of... misunderstandings... about the Silvermane Guards. They're fighting for survival here every day, just like Wildfire.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: The difference is we're making a stand for freedom... while they're just carrying out orders.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: That's why we have to try and put ourselves in their shoes.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: Put ourselves in their shoes... Easier said than done. Everyone has their struggles, but how can we understand them if we can't even see each other?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: Do you understand Bronya's struggles?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: Of course I do, I've understood them for a while now. But as far as I can tell, she doesn't need other people's understanding. She needs to understand her own heart.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: ...It's the same with Gepard. I could tell it took a lot for him to lay down his arms.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: It's time to finish this.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: I think I can already hear the storm on the other side of the city walls... Not a reassuring sound.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: I hope Serval's right... That supreme lunatic better not have harmed Bronya.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: You see? Brothers and sisters need to have a scrap once in a while to get back on good terms.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: Sorry for getting you involved in this.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Agh, enough apologizing. My ears can't take any more.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Honestly, this would have happened sooner or later. You just gave me an excuse to bring everything forward.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: So this is how brothers and sisters normally coexist?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: What's wrong with a bit of violent coexistence between siblings? Seems pretty normal to me.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Hehe, I'm pulling your leg. Since I left the military, my brother and I have always steered clear of certain sensitive topics... Thinking about it, perhaps he's just been looking out for my feelings, shielding me all along.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Knowing my temper, my brother almost certainly went to great lengths on many occasions for me. I should be thanking him.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: Let the Stellaron hunt begin.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Let's do this. I may never have come face to face with it, but this Stellaron cost me a nice, stable job. It's time to get even.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Actually, I have another selfish motive... I want to prove to Cocolia that I was right. Once we've taken care of the Stellaron... maybe she'll go back to how she was.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: ...Sorry, hardly the time for me to be obsessing over all this.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: We've got this.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: As I mentioned, if we want to progress further north, we're gonna have to cross that "hell." Still, look at it this way: just another arena to showcase our skills, right?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Now, if you're ready to get on stage, let's push for that standing ovation!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: As soon as the restricted zone gate is open, the monsters on the other side will turn out in full force. The Guards will do their best to stall them and buy you some time.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: Once you've broken through the front line... there's nothing more we can do for you. You'll have to find out for yourselves what lies within the northern Fragmentum.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: So... have you made up your minds?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: We're ready.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: Give us a moment...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: Understood. Keep your weapons close. This will be a fierce fight.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: Guards! Open the gate!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Are you dealing with attacks like this every day?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: It's a common occurrence.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: Guards, formation!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: Hmph, well I'm gonna make sure I don't owe the Guards any favors when this is done!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: For Bronya!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: For Belobog!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: For universal peace!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Here they come!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: Steel yourselves!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][March 7th]: ...How many of them are there!?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: The more the merrier, these guys are nothing! Hold the line!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: Argh...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: ...I told you, Gepard, the Barrier hasn't been fixed yet! Don't try and be a hero!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Gepard]: This is... only the first wave. They'll have reassembled soon... I have to...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: Hey, Mr. Silvermane, listen to your sister! I can tell just by looking at you that you haven't fully recovered.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: ...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Outsiders, Seele, the second wave hasn't started yet. Make the most of this opportunity and make a break for it!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][March 7th]: Huh? Serval, aren't you gonna look for the Stellaron with us?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: My brother can't hold them back by himself. He wasted a lot of energy on us. He's my responsibility now. Besides...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: If I'm not here to help... I don't know what might happen in the next wave.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: I want to go with you, I do! I always wanted to catch a glimpse of the Stellaron with my own eyes, and now it's so close...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: But I can't abandon my brother and the other Guards — I'm a Landau! It's up to you now, I believe in you. You've given me new hope!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Get hold of the Stellaron before Cocolia realizes what's happening!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: We can't abandon you either!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: Serval's right, . Let's go.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Dan Heng]: The Guards have opened up a way through for us, we can't let them down.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: We won't disappoint you.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: Chaaaaarge!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Hey March! Don't forget to take a picture of the Stellaron for me.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][March 7th]: Say no more! We're good at this. Don't worry!
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Welt]: Fragmentum activity is intensifying... Something's happening on Jarilo-VI.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Welt]: Shouldn't we go down there, Himeko?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Himeko]: Have faith in them. Besides, this is  first Trailblazing expedition. How will  be able to look back fondly without a few twists and turns?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Himeko]: Are you bored, Welt? I understand... But we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. Let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Welt]: So you think they'll be safe, right?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Himeko]: ...Yes, we haven't seen any Aeon or Emanator-level imaginary reactions. Relax.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Himeko]: This is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. At most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: Is this... the Fragmentum Gepard was talking about?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Dan Heng]: Compared to this, the corrosion we saw in Backwater Pass pales into insignificance.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: How can we pinpoint the Stellaron?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Dan Heng]: Serval said that the Stellaron was very likely hidden in the Snow Plains north of Belobog. If we want to get there, I'm afraid we'll have to find the exit to this Fragmentum maze first.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][March 7th]: Guys... does this place feel weird to you? It feels like... like there are loads of eyes staring at us.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: There's a restless atmosphere here.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][March 7th]: Oh yeah, . It feels like... like there are loads of eyes staring at us.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Dan Heng]: Serval said that the Stellaron was very likely hidden in the Snow Plains north of Belobog. If we want to get there, I'm afraid we'll have to find the exit to this Fragmentum maze first.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Seele]: ...This place makes my flesh crawl... like there are insects under my skin.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Dan Heng]: We have no guide and no way of detecting the Stellaron. We'll just have to advance gradually... and cautiously.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Dan Heng]: Don't be disheartened. The stronger the Fragmentum contamination, the closer we are to the source.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: How's Gepard doing?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Oh, you mean the thing in the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone? He just suffered a few flesh wounds, nothing serious. Don't worry — he's captain of the Silvermane Guards, so he isn't that fragile.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: After you went north into the Fragmentum, Gepard and I held off several waves of attack with some Silvermane Guards. We finally took our chances and shut off the entrance to the restricted zone.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: To tell the truth, the whole thing was thrilling... Endless monsters pouring out from the Fragmentum, rushing to the restricted zone. I almost thought we weren't gonna make it, but luckily I had my best guy with me...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: The previous Fragmentum attacks were nowhere near this vicious. *sigh* I mean back when I was still in the Silvermane Guards.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Now though... Things are really tough for Gepard.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: You've been in combat before?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Pretty much — I may be from the Technology Division, but my areas of expertise are Fragmentum and Stellarons. And you can't remain confined to the lab if you want to make a name for yourself in these fields.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: You didn't seem to worry much about Gepard before?
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: Not true. He's my little brother. And no matter what, as his big sister, I will always be worrying about him.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: It's just that I've always thought every Landau has their own drive. And my brother's really good at martial arts... I convinced myself that I wouldn't have to worry about him.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: But seeing how the Fragmentum attacks have been developing has changed my mind...
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: ...When he comes back next time, I'll definitely bring Pela along and we'll back him up.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Narration]: Thanks so much.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: No big deal! Most Landaus members work their ways into military careers, and we're used to this.
[Soldiers Stay Silent][Serval]: It's worth our time as long as you're making valuable gains from your trips to the Fragmentum.

[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Look, up ahead on the ground... What is that?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Be careful, think twice before you interact with anything in the Fragmentum.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Objects that have been exposed to Fragmentum corrosion might not be stable. I wouldn't touch that device if I were you.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: We're deep inside the Fragmentum... There could be hidden dangers lying in wait.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Let's look for other clues first.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: This is... Bronya's!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: We found it in the orphanage...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Yeah! So she's... she's been here already?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Could she be here too?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Right, she must be! This can't be a coincidence.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Wh—Whoa! Quick, look!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: That's Bronya! H—Huh? Is that Cocolia too!?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: No, it isn't them.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: It must be... a kind of echo? Some type of residual energy replicated by the Fragmentum...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Which means they were definitely here, right?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: And it looks like they went that way.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Ha, just in time! We had no idea which direction to take. Let's go!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: ...You still haven't told me what this place is, mother.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Seven hundred years ago, this was Belobog's northern border and the site of an ancient battle. Here is where Alisa Rand led the first Silvermane Guards in resistance against the Legion.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Now... it is nothing more than an abandoned corridor, filled with the sounds of Old World echoes.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Don't let its fragmented appearance fool you, Bronya. On the day the promise is fulfilled... these ruins will become the breeding ground of a new world.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: ...Mother, do you truly believe the Stellaron's promise? It summoned the blizzard beyond our walls and opened the door of the Fragmentum. It destroyed our civilization, it...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: ...And yet, the crime of our ancestors was their inability to embrace that destruction sooner...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: ...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: From the moment those intruders descended from beyond the sky, this world was handed a death sentence. But the Stellaron... has reserved for us a thread of hope.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: There is a price to pay for new life. Wiping away every decaying vestige of the Old World, renouncing the meaningless and lingering struggle... This is the price the Stellaron demands.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: When the promise is fulfilled, Bronya... no longer will we have to squander our lives guarding this wasteland. You and I will witness the new world rise from the ruins.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: ...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: This is a complex mechanism. How did they get past?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: *sigh* I knew this wouldn't be simple...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Wait! Wasn't there some big energy hub-looking thing back in that empty area? Let's go back and take a look, maybe it's linked to this gate.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: I can't say I like the idea of interacting with our surroundings — especially this deep into the Fragmentum. However...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: However?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: ...There's no other way. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Ha, even Dan Heng the sensible has his adventurous days!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: It worked, right?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: ...But, the gate didn't move an inch...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: *sigh* Are there other units around?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Hmm. It's clear that whoever designed these mechanisms didn't want outsiders to get through too easily. Let's keep looking for the energy hub.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Look over there! I think I can see the next unit.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: ...I see it too — let's go.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: It seems like it... Strange. Fragmentum monsters would usually destroy man-made objects.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Did you hear that? This mechanism must be on now!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Come on, let's find the next one!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Where is the next mechanism... Oh, behind that gate.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: There's no switch. We need to find a way around.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: I've never seen such a desolate place... At least in Rivet Town, you could tell that people used to live there.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Rivet Town is only at the outstretched fingertips of the corrosion... Now, we're deep in the Fragmentum's heart.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: :
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: :
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: : [Photo of Cavern Of Corrosion]
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: What is this, Mr. Yang?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Welt]: It appears to be a rift in space, torn open by the Fragmentum as it erodes reality. The scientific name for this phenomenon is "Cavern of Corrosion"
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Welt]: No one knows for sure what kind of space the Caverns are connected to. However, research does indicate that valuable reality data is often scattered within these Caverns
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Welt]: As with the Calyxes, the derivatives of the Fragmentum always carry unidentified risks. Please exercise extra caution if you wish to explore further
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: )
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Success! Another mechanism shut down.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: , I want to ask you a question.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Ask away.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Is now a good time?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Yes, I think this could well be the best time.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Do you still remember those dreams you mentioned to us?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: I know you're wide awake right now, but I need you to try. See if you can recall the "voice" you heard.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: You try to recall the dreams. As your train of thought deepens, the voice comes to you...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: You close your eyes but don't expect to remember anything. And yet, the voice comes to you...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Voice of the Stellaron]: Danger... approaches...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Voice of the Stellaron]: You must...eradicate... Once... and for all...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Well?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: There was... a voice calling out to Cocolia...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: The voice... it knows we're getting close.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: This is merely speculation... but perhaps the voice you heard is the Stellaron somehow conveying information to Cocolia...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: ...and the one in your body... is resonating with the Stellaron on this world.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Huh!? You mean that Stellaron can communicate? I've never heard that before...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Well, there's never been a human that could accommodate a Stellaron in their body.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: The Stellaron knows we're here...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: The Stellaron has already warned Cocolia...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: ...Then, aren't we walking straight into a trap?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: ...Yes. And Bronya may well be the bait.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Dan Heng's speculations are usually right on the money. But even if we've guessed right, we can't go home now.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Hmph... there's no way back anyway. At least Cocolia won't catch us off guard now. So what if it's an ambush!? We're not about to lose now!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: I have to save Bronya, beat Cocolia, and crush this Stellaron thing to dust!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Uh... Is this right?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: If we want to get to the other side, we'll need to rotate the gear bridge again and go around.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Done! It took some effort, but we finally cracked these mechanisms...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: We're one step closer to Bronya. Let's move!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: *gasp* Are these echoes too?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Yes. The Fragmentum here seems to have made a special connection with Cocolia. It's repeatedly generating forms in her image.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: I don't understand... Even if the truth is as you say, every generation of guardian has resisted the call of the Stellaron...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: Can all of them have been wrong, mother?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Do you still not see, Bronya? There is no right or wrong here. Some of them acted out of human pride, others out of human shortsightedness.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Our ancestors... including Alisa Rand... spent their whole lives trying to prolong this civilization. Then, after all fell still, their memories were scattered by the blizzard.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: They spent lifetimes writing songs of praise that lauded the bravery of humanity, but couldn't spare the time to gaze up into the stars.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: To those entities of greater magnificence in the heavens above, a thousand years is but a passing moment, the attainments of insignificant beings nothing more than a footnote.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: I shall not follow the guardians' misguided steps down that blind alley of narcissism. If persistence is futile, then one must choose a new beginning.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: But, Qlipoth the Preservation... Are THEY not one of the magnificent entities you speak of? Is it not THEIR strength... that has sheltered Belobog this entire time?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: The Preservation... Has the Preservation ever looked humanity in the eye? Nothing more than an arrogant delusion of the Architects.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: You will hear the real voice of magnificence, Bronya... Then, you will understand my choice.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Whoa, check this place out! Tables and sentry posts — there must have been Silvermane Guards stationed here once.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: If there were, they left a long time ago. There might be valuable information here... shame we don't have time to look for it.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Looks like another completely new monster.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Considering where we are, it would be surprising if we didn't run into strange enemies here.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: I don't care how strange it is, it's blocking our way... Let's get it!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: If we avoid the enemy, we might be ambushed further in.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: It'll be too late for regrets then... Let's defeat this one here.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: This enemy is completely different! If I didn't know it was a product of the Fragmentum, I'd think we were fighting a human!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Unlike those random low-level Fragmentum creations, this one seems to have a mind of its own. It seems to be able to use complex tactics.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Look, Bronya and Cocolia's echoes... they must have come through here.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: The voice is getting clearer...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: ...That means we must be really close, right?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: I'm starting to feel hazy...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Hey, stay with it! This is the final push!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: I sense that we're very near to the northern Snow Plains.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: This is where the first guardian led the Silvermane Guards into battle. She made huge sacrifices for the sake of temporary respite.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: But the otherworldly Legion did not tire. She soon realized that flesh and blood could not contend with so ruthless an enemy.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: When all was nearly lost, she chose to set her sights on the Stellaron... and made the first wish.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: As for what came later... you know as well as I.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: So... the Eternal Freeze was a disaster brought about by a human wish...?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Ironic, no? All the Stellaron did was answer humanity's call, and yet we kept its existence a closely guarded secret for centuries.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Even going so far as to attempt to use "it" to control the Stellaron... Woeful... laughable.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Bronya]: It?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: Something created using otherworldly technology... An inhibitor that the IPC from the Old World and the Architects attempted to use to house the Stellaron.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Cocolia]: ...I know you have any questions, my daughter. Be patient... soon you will have all the answers.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: It's that "shadow" of hers again... but Bronya's isn't with her this time.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: It's only a Fragmentum illusion. , let's get a closer look.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: It feels like his echo is different from the others before.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Cocolia's Echo: Intruders...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Huh!? Did... Did she just speak!?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Cocolia's Echo: You cannot... approach...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Not good — March, out the way!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Cocolia's Echo: ...the Stellaron!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Cocolia's Echo: Intruders... You go no further!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: A—Are you sure this isn't the real her?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: It may look like her, but the Fragmentum can only create forgeries. Bring her down!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: ...She disappeared.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Those stairs... it's the only way forward.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: Wherever they lead, it must be the end of the journey.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: I don't wanna get to the end so soon... I want my journey to go on forever.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: This means that Bronya is up ahead... and so is the fate of the Overworld and the Underworld... It's all in our hands.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: Strange, I thought I'd feel nervous or afraid... but I don't. The only feeling I have... is that none of this seems real.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Is this how Trailblazing expeditions usually come to an end?
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Not always, sometimes it's a happier conclusion.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: These two have gotten used to these expeditions.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: To be honest, you never really get used to them! We always used to rely on Himeko and Mr. Yang.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: Resting forever in the Snow Plains... that wouldn't be so bad.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Hey, way to boost morale over there!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: The Express has traveled world after world. We are merely passing travelers — witnesses to part of a grander story.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Dan Heng]: We invariably avoid getting drawn into turbulence that can decide the fate of a world... but there are always times when we have no choice but to act.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Or to put it another way, ... this is one heck of a first Trailblazing expedition! You hit the jackpot!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Seele]: I was about to bore you all with my gloomy reflections... but on second thought — not today. Adventuring with you guys by my side has made me feel like no obstacle is too big.
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Right on! But you can say whatever you like — a good adventure shouldn't be full of rules and regulations!
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][March 7th]: Helping those in need, befriending those worth counting on, and saving the world a few times along the way...
[The Stars Are Cold Toys][Narration]: This is the spirit of trailblazing!

[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: It's f—freezing here — the blizzard's so fierce! The power from the Trailblaze Path isn't enough to stop the cold...
[The Dawn Here...][Dan Heng]: It means that we're getting closer to the Stellaron... and the heart of the Eternal Freeze.
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: Wh—What is this? ...It's scary!
[The Dawn Here...][Dan Heng]: ...It's like an insect trapped in amber...
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: I bet the Antimatter Legion forces never thought they'd be swallowed up by the Eternal Freeze when they invaded this world.
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: Even in the ice... could these guys still be alive...?
[The Dawn Here...][Narration]: Wanna defrost them and find out?
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: No, no! We've got enough on our plate.
[The Dawn Here...][Narration]: Is this how you were...?
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: I... I don't remember... It's a blank canvas...
[The Dawn Here...][I hereby name him]: March 8th.
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: I'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now...
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: Did the Architects build this...?
[The Dawn Here...][Dan Heng]: ...very different from the uniform style of the buildings we saw in the city.
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: Does it... look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: If Cocolia threatens us by taking Bronya hostage...
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: We have to save her. The Underworld... no, the entire planet relies on her.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...N—No...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Do not resist, Bronya... Accept the common will!
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: No... I... I don't want this...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Look upon their promised future, Bronya! A world without poverty, without cold, without suffering... A world where people no longer have to pray like prisoners for survival... A world that we can guard for all eternity.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Seven hundred years ago, we tried and fought unceasingly, believing that the radiance of human nature could shepherd us towards rejuvenation. And to what end? A crushing defeat!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Why, when faced with irrefutable strength, is our first thought always to resist, to cover our ears, instead of hearing the call?
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: It is the conceit and cowardice entrenched in the depths of human nature — so difficult to efface. Cast them aside, break free of the chains that bind you! The Stellaron will lead humanity to evolve, and THEY will...
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: Your brainwashing ends here, you witch!
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...Seele?
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: ...You came. I thought the blizzards had entombed you...
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: You wish! We're not going down before you do!
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: Bronya! I don't know what happened between you and them. Even if you explained it to me, I probably wouldn't understand all the crazy details. But there are two things I do know...
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: One: These guys have come through hell to get here — to seal this Stellaron thing.
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: And two: Do you remember what I said? If anything happened to you, I'd save you.
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: Do you understand? Even if the damage is done — even if you've completely forgotten our promise, then... then I'm just gonna have to knock you out and bring you back myself!
[The Dawn Here...][Narration]: We need you...
[The Dawn Here...][Narration]: ...Belobog needs you, Bronya.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: Seele, all of you...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: ...Finished? I think I've given you long enough, to... bid farewell.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: It's time told you my other reason for bringing you here, Bronya.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: I want to witness your choice.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: I have told you all the truths there are to tell: The deal with the Stellaron, the wish I made to it... There are no more secrets between us.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Many years ago, the voice of the Stellaron sounded in my ears for the first time. I was no different from the previous generations of guardians... I withdrew, refused to hear. I was as you are now — bitterly defending the Architects' so-called "Preservation..."
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: My conviction was once steadfast, unparalleled... until a sudden change arrived and threw everything into chaos. Another choice appeared before me — a subversion of the old order... and the welcoming of a new world.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: And compared to the illusory, evermore distant Preservation, this was so tangible...
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: I have agonized — long agonized over how to convey all this to you. Inevitably, the promised tomorrow will transpire... but if you were not there beside me, to watch over that new world...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: ...Then I would descend into torment, Bronya — enduring torment!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Perhaps I should be thanking you, outsiders. The pressure you have imposed... has at long last compelled me to confront my final... weakness.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Bronya, throughout your life, I have never forced you to submit to my will. You have always, will always have a choice... as then, so now.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Choose, my daughter.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: Madam Cocolia... I am grateful to you for raising me, and for allowing me the privilege of choice.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: But... I am sorry, mother. On this, our final occasion, I cannot stand with you.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: ...
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: You say that conceit and cowardice lie in the depths of human nature — perhaps you're right... desperation sheds light on the darkest recesses of the heart.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...But what about those simply struggling for survival, fighting for something better? I've witnessed their light on the front lines, in the Underworld... in places you have overlooked.
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: Our ancestors built this city — striving in the bitter snow to prolong our civilization. Even if this world is doomed to fall apart, we should allow humanity to pave the way to its final outcome...
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: ...Not hand over our fate to this seed of ruin!
[The Dawn Here...][Voice of the Stellaron]: ...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: ...
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: We are guardians, mother! Chosen from among the masses! Our duty is to preserve the world built by humanity! We are not gods! We are not arbiters!
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: You seek to crush human nature underfoot while masquerading as an... as an arbiter and a god! I cannot let you!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: So... this is your choice. I understand, Bronya.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Pity... Such a pity that you will never see that resplendent world... Unable to free yourself from the shackles of your mind... You know what? You were supposed to be... the mother of the new world.
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: The ground... it's shaking! What's happening!?
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: Bad sign...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: The fate of this city... of Belobog... is sealed. Its future will unfold in our hands.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: And you... will become the foundation of the new world!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: You must break the old to build the new.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: The supreme guardian commands you...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Rise, Engine of Creation!
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: It's one of the Architects' ancient machines! Watch out, all of you!
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: Th—This robot's a thousand times bigger than Svarog!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Engine... break them!
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: ...We have to stop it!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Raze to oblivion!
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: How can we bring a giant like this down?
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: ...Himeko, it's Himeko!
[The Dawn Here...][Himeko]: Hello? Can you hear me? This signal is terrible...
[The Dawn Here...][March 7th]: Himeko! You finally spared a thought for us!
[The Dawn Here...][Himeko]: What are you talking about — Welt and I have been up on the star rail missing you this whole time! You've got quite the Trailblazing expedition on your hands.
[The Dawn Here...][Himeko]: So how does this big guy work...? Or more importantly — how do you stop him from working? Over to you guys, I guess!
[The Dawn Here...][Bronya]: I'll cover you!
[The Dawn Here...][Seele]: Grab hold of me!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Behold... the power granted by them!
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Listen to the power surge... sing...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: The Stellaron's promise is the only hope for this world...
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Just as it dispelled the Antimatter Legion 700 years ago, so too will it wipe you from the face of this world.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: *vicious laughter* Humanity... so weak and foolish. Always overestimating their abilities.
[The Dawn Here...][Cocolia]: Let me bestow upon you... despair!

[The Return][Narration]: Mission DescriptionYou wake up in a strange place surrounded by nebulous stars, seemingly enveloped by an amber-colored destiny.The last thing you remember is being pierced by Cocolia's lance... Could this be the afterlife? But your mind is still very clear and your body still has strength... These resounding voices in your head seem to be guiding you, telling you that you are still alive.Your companions might still be in fierce combat with Cocolia. You have to find a way to get back to their side, no matter what. Path Space
[The Return][Gepard]: The Commercial District has fallen. We've transfered [sic] the residents to the Outer Municipal District for the time being. The Garrison lost 26 fighters... but I...
[The Return][Cocolia]: ...Go on, Gepard.
[The Return][Gepard]: I... I'm not sure that they're dead... I saw their broken figures lingering in the Fragmentum...
[The Return][Gepard]: What happened back there defied all reason... it was madness. Madam Guardian, if this continues...
[The Return][Cocolia]: ...I know well the consequences, Gepard. You may leave.
[The Return][Voice of the Stellaron]: ...We know well the consequences.
[The Return][Serval]: ...Why do you hesitate, Cocolia? Isn't this what you've always been hoping for? Get out of this cage and take a look at the city. What is there to lose!?
[The Return][Serval]: The efforts of our predecessors... their unfinished research... we can finally see them come to fruition! Give me some soldiers and I'll locate the Stellaron and find out how to save our world—
[The Return][Cocolia]: ...You need to come to your senses, Serval.
[The Return][Serval]: Come... to my senses? What are you—
[The Return][Cocolia]: Guards! Miss Serval is tired, take her to rest.
[The Return][Cocolia]: Sequester her lab and detain the researchers — their work is illegal.
[The Return][Serval]: ...Why Cocolia... Why have you grown so cold...
[The Return][Cocolia]: Serval Landau... you were my most cherished friend.
[The Return][Voice of the Stellaron]: ...But there is no place for her in the promised new world.
[The Return][Soldier]: Madam Cocolia, the monsters are surging this way! ...It's too dangerous here!
[The Return][Cocolia]: ...Foolish, weak...
[The Return][Composed Silvermane Guard]: ...What? Madam, what are you saying?
[The Return][Cocolia]: Only I... Only I can understand. They have eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear...
[The Return][Soldier]: ...Aghhhhhhhh...!
[The Return][Cocolia]: Feast on their willful ignorance... absolve them of their stupidity and fear...
[The Return][Bronya]: Mother... I still don't understand.
[The Return][Bronya]: The Fragmentum corrosion has already spread to the Underworld. How will those below ground fend for themselves if we withdraw every guard?
[The Return][Cocolia]: The automatons will ensure their safety. The most important defensive position is here on the surface. If our lines crumble, the underground will vanish in an instant. Our defenses here must be maintained at all costs.
[The Return][Cocolia]: These are the choices we make, Bronya... As a leader, you must harbor the courage and foresight to choose.
[The Return][Cocolia]: You, me, and every Silvermane Guard in the city, all of us must carry out a higher mission. There will come a day when you must make your own choice. Do you understand?
[The Return][Bronya]: Higher mission...?
[The Return][Cocolia]: It is too early Bronya... still too early. You will understand when the time is right.
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: The city is drowning in tears... The power of the Preservation is fading.
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: We could not deny the will of the Stellaron after all...
[The Return][Narration]: Cocolia abandoned the Preservation.
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: Yes... But we have no right to judge.
[The Return][Narration]: This is not what the Preservation would have wanted...
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: Ah, a believer, I see?
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: The Fragmentum had been expanding for the past 700 years. There is no faith nor wealth left for our successors... only despair.
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: To see the home we vowed to preserve wither away... That in itself is torture. Not to mention the haunting whisper of temptation...
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: The day will come when even the strongest of wills cannot help but give in to such influence. It is only a matter of time before the Amber Lord forsakes us.
[The Return][Narration]: Some people can't be swayed.
[The Return][Narration]: Then let others carry on the will of the Preservation.
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: You...
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: You are but a stranger to us. And yet you seek to bond your destiny to ours...
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: So be it. What is there to lose when so much has already been lost...
[The Return][Narration]: Guardians' Will: Touch the light of the Amber, trailblazer. See if your will can attract THEIR gaze.
[The Return][March 7th]: Haha
[The Return][Cocolia]: No... It can't be...
[The Return][Bronya]: The will of Preservation has made its choice...
[The Return][Cocolia]: You know nothing of the plight of this world... nothing of the wait for its final end!
[The Return][Bronya]: Even if we are doomed to destruction, we will go bravely, walking hand in hand into the darkness...
[The Return][March 7th]: No! That end won't come to pass while we're around!
[The Return][Cocolia]: The power of the Stellaron is with me...
[The Return][Cocolia]: You are but cinders of the Old World soon to become ashes!
[The Return][Bronya]: Let me go — I gotta... I have to get to her!
[The Return][Cocolia]: The Stellaron...
[The Return][Cocolia]: ...promised us the future!
[The Return][Cocolia]: It will...
[The Return][Cocolia]: ...engulf everything!
[The Return][Bronya]: Mother!
[The Return][Bronya]: Stop!
[The Return][Seele]: It's over...
[The Return][Bronya]: ...
[The Return][Bronya]: Mother... Did you wake up from that dream...?
[The Return][March 7th]: Wow... that was a tough trailblazing expedition. Dan Heng,  — we made it! But, uh, what are we gonna do with the Stellaron? It's usually Mr. Yang who handles it...
[The Return][Dan Heng]: I've informed Himeko and Mr. Yang already. They'll seal the Stellaron.
[The Return][March 7th]: Nice! The crisis on this world is basically over, right?
[The Return][Dan Heng]: ...
[The Return][Dan Heng]: ...The storm still rages on.
[The Return][Dan Heng]: Now that the Stellaron is sealed, the Eternal Freeze will slowly recede. The Fragmentum won't aggressively expand anymore, but nor will it disappear. Jarilo-VI has a chance to return to life, but it will take time...
[The Return][Dan Heng]: It will depend on the efforts of the people here.
[The Return][Bronya]: Thank you... all of you.
[The Return][Narration]: Don't be too hard on yourself.
[The Return][Bronya]: Thank you ... I—I'm fine. Don't worry.
[The Return][Narration]: What do you want to do now?
[The Return][Bronya]: This victory is only the beginning for Belobog.
[The Return][Narration]: Can't think of anything funny to say...
[The Return][Bronya]: Hehe, start thinking, we're going to need all the humor we can get... At least the biggest hurdle is behind us.
[The Return][Bronya]: There is still much to do... The people will have felt the effects of the Engine of Creation. There are so many questions to answer, so many truths to reveal...
[The Return][Bronya]: I don't know whether I can get the people to accept all this...
[The Return][Narration]: Tell everyone the truth.
[The Return][Bronya]: Can I really do that...?
[The Return][Bronya]: Tell everyone about Mother's true motives... about a lie perpetrated for 700 years...
[The Return][Seele]: No... No, no way.
[The Return][Narration]: Cover up the truth...
[The Return][Bronya]: You mean...
[The Return][Bronya]: ...Use a lie to conceal a lie. But if I do that, then...
[The Return][Seele]: You have to, Bronya.
[The Return][Bronya]: ...Seele?
[The Return][Seele]: I... I don't know how to explain it... but I don't think there's any other way.
[The Return][Seele]: In the Underworld, we tell the kids "things will be better tomorrow." Everyone knows it's a lie, but it gets them to sleep with some hope.
[The Return][Seele]: Can you imagine the consequences if we told the people what happened here? They'd be devastated. If we can't trust the guardians, who — or what — can we trust...?
[The Return][Bronya]: ...
[The Return][Bronya]: ...Mother died to preserve Belobog.
[The Return][March 7th]: ...What?
[The Return][Bronya]: The visitors from beyond the sky told her the secret of the Stellaron. She knew that Alisa Rand, the first supreme guardian, had failed to destroy it...
[The Return][Bronya]: ...and yet she decided to challenge its power — a power beyond human comprehension. Supreme Guardian Cocolia sacrificed herself to dispel the dark clouds enveloping this city.
[The Return][Bronya]: ...From here on out, that's the "truth" the world will hear. What do you think?
[The Return][Seele]: It keeps the hope of preservation alive, at least.
[The Return][Dan Heng]: It's logical... and hard to disprove.
[The Return][March 7th]: Why do we have to lie? ...I'm abstaining — I like telling the truth. But... I get what you're trying to do.
[The Return][Narration]: Agreed — let's use this version.
[The Return][Bronya]: Thank you for understanding, .
[The Return][Narration]: A lie will always be a lie...
[The Return][Bronya]: I understand, but... I must protect those that believe in the Architects...
[The Return][Narration]: ...Maybe we include some of the cool stuff we did?
[The Return][Bronya]: Sorry... I'll be sure to make it up to you.
[The Return][Bronya]: For many people, mother was an outstanding guardian... The whole truth will live on in my mind — all the mistakes, madness, evil, and dreams therein... I will be the one to carry that burden.
[The Return][Bronya]: Now I must take over the duties of the supreme guardian... and discard my naive fantasies.
[The Return][Bronya]: I'm sorry, Seele. Please protect this secret with me... till the end of our lives.
[The Return][Seele]: Say no more — I know what to do.
[The Return][Bronya]: Thank you.
[The Return][Bronya]: Well then, as promised, let's start rebuilding the bridge between the Overworld and the Underworld.
[The Return][Bronya]: Seele, can you tell everyone in the Underworld that the Stellaron has been sealed? Tell them the blockade will soon be over... and they'll breathe freely again soon.
[The Return][Seele]: Of course, leave it to me — Nat's probably getting anxious about the delay.
[The Return][Bronya]: While you do that, I'll head back to the Administrative District. I need to tell Gepard... Serv— ah...
[The Return][Seele]: ...Are you okay!?
[The Return][March 7th]: What's wrong, Bronya? Do you feel sick?
[The Return][Bronya]: I'm... fine. I need to... hurry...
[The Return][March 7th]: She's exhausted! Quick, we need to think of something... , help me out here!
[The Return][Narration]: Seele, take Bronya back with you.
[The Return][Narration]: We'll go to the Underworld and pass on the message.
[The Return][Seele]: Right... I almost forgot, you're still wanted by the guards... I might be an Underworlder, but at least I don't stand out as much as you guys.
[The Return][Seele]: That's settled then. I'll leave Nat to you. Remember to keep the secret — for Bron— No, for Belobog's sake.
[The Return][March 7th]: So, , wanna tell us what happened back there? Don't think you can just reappear on the battlefield with a cool weapon in your hands and skip the story.
[The Return][Narration]: I saw Qlipoth the Preservation...
[The Return][March 7th]: Uh... you drew the Amber Lord's gaze? Right at that moment? That's too much of a coincidence...
[The Return][Narration]: That's the second time I've sacrificed myself for you, March...
[The Return][March 7th]: Um... thank you? That's not answering my question though...
[The Return][Narration]: All of a sudden, I was infused with a great and terrible power...!
[The Return][March 7th]: Be serious! I really wanna know...
[The Return][Dan Heng]: probably doesn't know what happened either. This wouldn't be the first time... Something similar happened when we faced the Doomsday Beast on the space station. Remember that glance from Nanook?
[The Return][Dan Heng]: Originally, we thought it was because the Stellaron was linked to the Destruction, but now it seems to be more than that. We might need to speak with Mr. Yang to understand what's going on.
[The Return][Dan Heng]: Let's focus on the business at hand first. We shouldn't disrupt Himeko and Mr. Yang while they're dealing with the Stellaron. Let's talk once we're back on the Express.
[The Return][March 7th]: Mm, you're right, we need to finish what we started... Let's hurry up and find Natasha.
[The Return][Seele]: Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere? Do you feel dizzy? Tired? Or...
[The Return][Bronya]: ...I don't know, Seele. I feel... cold... all over.
[The Return][Seele]: Isn't that normal? This place is freezing... *sneeze* Ugh...
[The Return][Bronya]: Let's get out of here before you catch a cold too.
[The Return][Seele]: Don't worry, I'm a tough cookie. Here, hold on to me... let's go.

[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Look! There's a big crowd around the clinic.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Do you think they felt the effects of the battle just now...? Let's go ask around.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Male Civilian]: What was that shaking just now?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Male Civilian]: I thought the whole building was about to collapse...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Female Civilian]: The ground just kept on shaking...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Female Civilian]: Was it the Fragmentum?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Girl]: Was it an earthquake?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Man]: No, it couldn't have been an earthquake...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Girl]: What about an avalanche?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Man]: Eh, not an avalanche either...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Girl]: Then could it be the end of the world?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Man]: Maybe...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Elderly Man]: It's over, we're doomed...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Elderly Man]: I haven't even written my will yet!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Elderly Woman]: What are you so worked up about?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Elderly Woman]: It's not like we have much to will to anyone in the first place.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Natasha! Oleg! Hope you didn't have to wait too long.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Oh! It's them!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Oleg]: You kids move fast! By the look on your faces, I assume you come bearing good news?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Mm-hmm, you bet! You might not believe this, but we summoned up all our strength, and then...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Uh, maybe  should do the talking. I'm no good at serious stuff — I'll probably say something I'll regret.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: The guardian sacrificed herself to seal the Stellaron.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: We were there at the fight — we witnessed everything.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Do you feel like recounting the story, Dan Heng...?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: The supreme guardian sacrificed herself to seal the Stellaron. We were there at the fight — we witnessed everything.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: "Sacrificed herself," huh... Sure. Yeah. That's the whole story...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Cocolia? In order to save Belobog, she... I see.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Oleg]: So the massive tremors we felt earlier were a result of the battle, right?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Yes, it was a hard-won victory.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: We quite literally saved the world...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Through patting yourself on the back!?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: ...Thank you. I can't even imagine what you've been through up there. I'm just glad everything turned out alright.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: What about Seele?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Don't worry, she's alright! It took a big toll on Bronya, so Seele took her over to the Guards.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Good... I'm so glad you're all okay.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Oleg]: Now that Cocolia is no more, I guess our Silvermane girl is about to become the next supreme guardian?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Oleg]: She sees things through and doesn't go back on her word. The Underworld will thrive again under her watch.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Mm-hmm! Oh, we brought you a message from Bronya! Ahem, "The blockade will soon be lifted. The people of the Underworld will breathe freely."
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: "Breathe freely..." That's been our wish all along.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: March, Dan Heng, and ... can I ask for your help again? I want to get this news out to everyone. It'll lift their spirits and bring them hope.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Count us in.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: I can't wait to see their faces.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Thank you. Choose whoever you like. Wildfire will take care of the rest.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: We've gotten to know a lot of Underworlders... , who do you think we should start with?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Let's start with the mining team over at the Great Mine.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Let's start with Hook and The Moles.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Let's start with Gertie.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Roger that — you can leave the rest to us. If everything goes smoothly... this should be Wildfire's final mission.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Do you think the Great Mine was affected by our fighting on the surface?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: Let's hope we didn't cause a collapse.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Look, it's Antonia! The miners and vagrants are all in the same spot.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: I sure hope they're not arguing again... Quick, let's head over!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: ...Here, take it. I'm afraid we're short on goods and materials right now.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Humble Vagrant]: Oh, well we actually have enough for the moment. You hang on to it...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Hey! Are you guys causing trouble again?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: It's you! Oh, no, no, you misunderstand...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: There was a huge quake at the mine just now — part of it collapsed. If the vagrants here hadn't stopped to help, I doubt we'd have gotten everyone out in one piece.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: I was just discussing how to repay them. It's a shame the mining team is hard up right now.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Wanna hear something really great?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: Oh? To do with us? I'm listening...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: I've got you covered.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Uh... can't we get Bronya to cover the bill?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Ugh, can we focus? , tell them the good news already!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Telling the mining team and the vagrants about the victory...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: You mean to say that... we're about to be reunited with the Overworld?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Humble Vagrant]: Are you serious!? This has... gotta be a dream. Good things... don't happen to us!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Today they do! And you're not dreaming. If you don't believe us, pinch yourself!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: If things go back to the way they were 10 years ago... then the mining team can finally escape this poverty...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: ...and you won't have to rely on the charity of others. We'll finally be living with the dignity we deserve.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Humble Vagrant]: I... *sniff* *sob*
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Come on. Wipe your tears.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Let it out!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: Thank you, outsiders, from the bottom of my heart! The mining team'll remember you as heroes... as will the rest of the Underworld.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Antonia]: Please tell Natasha that we're ready to get back to work... If the cable car station can start operating again, we'll dispatch a mining representative to negotiate with the Architects.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Those kids better not have taken advantage of the chaos to go on an expedition.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Hook does always talk about wanting to go on a Rivet Town adventure... this could be bad.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: 48... 49... 50!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: Ready or not, here I come!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Julian? Quick, let's go see!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Found you! You ran all the way out here just to play hide-and-seek? It's too dangerous!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: M—Miss March!? D—Didn't you go back to the surface...?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Since when did I become "Miss" March? And where's Hook and the others? Come on, call them over.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: Aww... but we just started playing. Can't we finish this round first...?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Say no more — this is gonna be easy!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: Seasoned pros, I see...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Hey, it wasn't like I wanted to play! The kids forced us to...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: If we had lollipops, they'd give themselves up in no time.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Great idea! Shame we don't have any.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: Well, we better go and find them.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: ...A—Actually, I sorta wanna go play on the swings for a while... I'll leave the seeking to you guys!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Aha! Gotcha!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Alina]: ...Huh? Grown-ups? Where's Julian?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Alina]: Hmph, so he is a scaredy-cat. I knew he'd get someone else to talk to me...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Well, that explains "sorta wanna go play on the swings for a while..."
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: It's not safe here.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: You should be happy it's us and not Natasha! If she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Alina]: Mm... I guess so. Anyway, I'm gonna go find Julian.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Hook! Hehe, got you again!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Huh!? Wh—What the heck are you guys doing here? Ugh, wait till I get my hands on Julian, that traitor... Where's his integrity!?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: What about your integrity, huh? You brought the other kids out here to Rivet Town, didn't you?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: I... I did not! The Moles hold a vote on all our expedition destinations!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Gather your minions, Hook. We've got exciting news!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: ...Fine, I will. But it better be exciting.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Maybe we should go and get Natasha...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Ah, you snitch! You'll regret it, I'm warning you...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Okay, okay, that's enough of that. Let's go and find Julian.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Hide-and-seek update... Astral Express crew — 2, The Moles — 0!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Hmph, celebrate while you can! Hide-and-seek is best of five, y'know...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Anyway, enough about hide-and-seek. You came all this way to tell The Moles something, so spit it out.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Hehe... , do you wanna do the honors?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Telling The Moles about the victory...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: ...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: ...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Huh? What's wrong? Why aren't you saying anything?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Alina]: Hook, Julian...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Is our story that scary?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: I wasn't expecting this reaction...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: *sob*
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: ...H—Hey! Wipe your tears, Julian! You're second-in-command — no crying in front of grown-ups!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Hmph, you three listen up. Starting from today, you are The Moles' number one rivals!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Rivals...? Why the heck are we rivals now? What are you talking about?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Alina]: ...Hook and Julian always wanted to defeat the villains on the surface and take back our homeland.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Alina]: But it sounds like you grown-ups just stole their thunder, so...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Hmph! You think we're gonna accept defeat just like that!? One day The Moles will be the heroes of the Underworld and the Overworld! Then everyone will sit... sit...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Sit up and take notice!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Sit down and shut up!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Sit up and take notice, right?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Ah! Yeah — sit up and take notice! I—I would've figured it out myself. I didn't need you to remind me!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: So that's why you were so silent! Hmph, if you wanna be as awesome as us, you better start training every day~
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: ...And start listening to Natasha.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Training every day... listening to the old witch... Will that really make us as awesome as you guys? In that case... deal!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Hook]: Julian, Alina, let's run back to the town! Training starts today!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: Y—Yes boss! Understood!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Julian]: Uh, Alina, I can... uh... give you a piggyback if you can't make it...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Why is everyone in such a hurry? I hope nothing's happened at the hotel...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: We should take a look, maybe we can help.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: I see Gertie! But who's that laying on the ground?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Quick, let's head over!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Oh my, this doesn't look good... Can you hear me? Are you okay?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Joshua]: H—He's still breathing! T—Try not to p—panic Aunt Gertie...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Is everything okay? Wait, isn't that... Peak? Don't tell me he fell asleep in the middle of the road again.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Oh, it's you three! Back in the Underworld so soon?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Word must have gotten out that I was renovating the hotel today. Being the kind-hearted young man that he is, Peak came straight over and offered to help.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: There we were hard at work, when all of a sudden the hotel started shaking... I got everyone outside as fast as I could, but I think Peak was hit by a ceiling tile...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Are you sure he was "hard at work...?"
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Look! Seems like he's coming around.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Quick, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: I... don't think that's necessary. Look, he's awake.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Peak]: Huh...? Argh...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Peak, are you awake? Oh, thank goodness you're alright! Easy now, take your time...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Peak]: Argh, my back... I was having such a great nap, how did I...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Joshua]: A—Are you okay, bro? L—Let me take you to N—Natasha's clinic...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Hey, look where he was lying. What is that?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: It's...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: ...an old photo. I thought I lost this ages ago. How did it get...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Aunt Gertie, isn't that you in the photo? And Old Goethe, too! You look so young!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Don't I know it. My distant cousin had only just taken over the family business at the time. He wrote me a letter inviting me to head up and take a look. It's been nearly 20 years already...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: *sigh* I remember chatting in the hotel lobby and drinking tea. I wonder if we'll ever get another chance to do that...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Y'know, we've got some good news for you, haven't we, ?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: You tell Gertie about the victory...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: ...Is that true? Bronya, she... I—I can't believe my ears!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Put your faith in Bronya.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: You and Old Gothe will have the kettle on the stove in no time.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: I... Hahaha! I don't know what to say! Turns out things aren't always lost forever. *sigh* It feels like better days are finally on the horizon!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Thank you all so much for coming to tell me the good news. I haven't felt like this in a long time... We'll get plenty of guests staying at the hotel again once the passageway is open!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: But there's no way I'm letting them set eyes on the old place looking like this... Oh, and we're gonna need to expand the menu. Oh dear. Action stations!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Peak]: Action... stations? Already? Ooh, um — ow, oww...! My head...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Gertie]: Please let Dr. Natasha know not to worry — we're all okay... You three will have to come and stay again once the hotel is fully renovated!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: MessagesThe Astral Express FamilyWelt@ @March 7th @Dan Heng, the sealing of the Stellaron is complete, and the spatial distortion is dissipating. Good job.We should be back soonWe should be back soonWe'll need to stay here a little longerWe'll need to stay here a little longerWeltDon't rush, go at your own pace. The Express will be here, before you're ready to leave.March 7thGreat!I'm craving some juice... Pom-Pom still owes me a glass!Dan HengHow is Jarilo-VI?WeltNot great. Even though the influence of the Stellaron has basically subsided, the existing Fragmentum is too deeply rooted.The Eternal Freeze has lasted a very long time, enough to severely impact the ecology of the planet.In short, the planet probably won't regain the vitality that it once had a thousand years ago in such a short time.March 7thOh... How could this be?Is there anything else we can do?Is there anything else we can do?Welt...As Trailblazers, our mission has already concluded successfully. The fate of this world should be handed back to its inhabitants.Humankind has always struggled against austere conditions and had always managed to thrive in spite of it. Now that the Eternal Freeze is gone, the Fragmentum has lost its momentum to expand.Jarilo-VI will be revitalized. Believe in the perseverance of her people.I detected a high-frequency spatial energy surge in the north of Jarilo-VI. You might be interested in checking it out.Don't worry. That energy is not related to the Stellaron. It's only an Echo left behind after spatial distortions fade away.Inside the Echo, our perceptions of space and time that we are used to will become radically altered, to the point where it might even reconstruct certain scenes from our own past experiences.If you're in the mood and wish to re-live those memorable adventures, you can try your luck at places where Echoes can be found.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...Mr Yang put it nicely, but the reality is this: We sealed the Stellaron, but that's not gonna solve the problems on this planet...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: There I was getting exited to tell everyone the good news...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: We did make a promise...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: We did all we could. Now it's a matter of time...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Does this count as false advertising?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: That's the cruelty of a Stellaron. Still, compared with some of the other planets we've visited, at least this one has hope.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: So... should we tell everyone the deal?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: We should tell Bronya when the time's right. Let's not dampen the spirit just yet.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Doctor Natasha, we're back...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Oh is everyone alright? Thanks for your help.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Maybe next time we can send a group notification...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Haha. Sometimes face-to-face communication is more meaningful, don't you think?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: For you, anything.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: I'm flattered, .
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: Now we just have to wait for the official news. I hope Bronya doesn't keep us too long.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Huh... do you think Svarog and Clara felt the effects of our battle with the guardian?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Natasha]: I think they'll be fine... Plus Svarog's devotion to Clara is even greater than his hostility to Wildfire. If you're worried, you could look for them over at the robot settlement.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Perkins]: Outssssiders... F—Friends of Clara.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Hey Perkins!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: How did you know that was Perkins...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Did Clara fix you?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Perkins]: Th—Th—Th—Thank you... for rescuing... Claaaara.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Seems like Perkins picked up a stammer?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: Its language module must have malfunctioned... Can you take us to Clara?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Perkins]: Outsiders... are f—friends of Clara... Follow me...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Svarog]: You have visitors, Clara.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Clara]: Ah! It's the variables!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Another nickname for the collection...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Nice haircut, Svarog.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Are you trying to start another fight...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Clara]: There was a huge shaking just now coming up through the ground. Mr. Svarog said it... must have been...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Svarog]: Recalculating... Conclusion: Engine of Creation. 97.66% probability.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Old friend of yours?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Any other secret weapons you'd like to tell us about...?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Svarog]: The Engine of Creation was an immense construction machine created by the Architects. It was not built to fight.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Well whatever, we won... Thanks to that giant robot, we were finally able to take care of the Stellaron... and Bronya made a promise — the Underworld and the Overworld will soon be reunited.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: Which means that you, Svarog — uh... You won't have to worry about preserving the Underworld... for the time being.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Clara]: March, everyone... thank you so much! I wasn't sure you guys would be able to do it, but...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Clara]: But now... Mr. Svarog, what do you say?
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Clara]: You guys said you were travelers from other worlds, right? I want to be just like you... One day, I'm gonna go traveling to faraway places and make new friends.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: I know you will.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Narration]: Your future is yours to decide!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Svarog]: Calculation result... update. Mission number 0001 — Preserve the Underworld — complete.
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: That's our Bronya — quick as a flash!
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][Dan Heng]: She certainly moves a lot faster than some people I know...
[In the Dangerous Muddy Swamp][March 7th]: ...If you haven't got anything nice to say right now, zip it!

[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: You made it... I thought you were about to miss out on a moment of history.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: No way! After all our hard work, how could we miss out on the final celebration? Right, ?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: I'll go sit at the children's table.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: Haha, I don't know how much of a celebration we'll be having... but I know Hook and Clara will be pleased to sit with you.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: The smell of freedom's in the air...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: Hehe, I smell it too.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: For Oleg and I, not to mention the other adults, reopening the passageway means rediscovering old ways of living... — a return to "normality..." Survival is no longer the top of the agenda...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: But for the children who were born into this era, who grew up in this isolation... this will be a new life altogether.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: ...Once you've tasted freedom, it's difficult to accept a life of separation and isolation. Those of us whose childhoods were marred by tragedy... we must strive to do better for the next generation.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: I'm sorry, here I am talking your ear off again. This is a day to remember. We should welcome it with smiles.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: If you have time, talk to the folks here — every one of them will tell you about their excitement. Then, when you're ready... let's "go home."
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: It's been more than ten years. I can finally see my little girl again...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: She must have graduated by now. I hope she found a good job — government administration or legal consulting, perhaps...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: Please, Amber Lord, anything but those terrible magazine publishers! She's always liked to read those pointless things...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Alina]: Mommy, what do children in the Overworld dress like?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dunya]: Mommy doesn't know either, sweety — the Overworld is different from here. Their fashion is always changing, I don't know what's popular these days...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Alina]: Then... will other children laugh at me when we go up?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dunya]: Don't be silly, that won't happen — mommy's gonna buy you some pretty new clothes as soon as we're on the surface.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Alina]: ...Deal! Thanks, mommy.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Joshua]: The Guards... they m—moved so q—quickly... don't you think it's a little f—fishy?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Elaine]: I... I think it's hard to believe, but I've met that young lady Bronya. We didn't talk much, but she felt trustworthy to me.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Fidora]: I don't really know what kind of person the new guardian is, but I heard the three outsiders are on good terms with her.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Fidora]: Those three are really capable people. If they believe the Guards, then there's no reason for us not to.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Joshua]: I g—guess...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Elaine]: Fidora's right. They saved lots of people at the mines... I think they can be trusted.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: Finally... Finally I can get back to supervising the cable cars! I thought I'd spend the rest of my life in those mines...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: Ah, it's you! The liberators of the Underworld! You're the first passengers we've had since being sealed off — it'll be my honor to get you to the surface in one piece!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Do you have a license?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: Oh, uh, I'm afraid you might have to make an exception, . My license has expired, but then I haven't had the chance to go up and renew it for 10 years now...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Does this thing have a good safety record?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: Relax, relax! In all my 20 years on the job, there were only ever, uh... Anyway, none of them were serious!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: *cough* So! Ready to climb aboard?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Time to take the kids out for some fresh air.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: Brothers, sisters, ladies, gentlemen, boys, and girls of all ages — gather round! The cable car passenger service is about to restart!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Not yet.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Cable Car Operator]: No problem, this car won't be leaving without you!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Media]: Trailblaze Mission No Time for Me, My Friend 1.mp4
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Hook]: Whoaaaa...! Look at the big blue ceiling!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: That's not a ceiling, Hook... that's the sky.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Clara]: So this is... the Overworld? The air here smells... different.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Oleg]: Hahaha, less rust and Geomarrow particles floating around. Take a deep breath, children — this is what freedom tastes like.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Oleg]: ...I never thought I'd live to see the Administrative District again. All those years... We've been through a lot, Natasha.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: ...You're right, Oleg.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: It's funny... The moment I boarded the cable car, my mind was filled with everything I wanted to do on the surface...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: But now... I just want to sit down, zone out, and watch the people coming and going... and let the day just pass me by...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Oleg]: Enjoy the peace and quiet, Natasha. We earned it.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Ah, it's Gepard! Is he here to meet us?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dan Heng]: He's still on duty. Huh, he must have recovered quickly.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Let's go say hi.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: Sasha! My Sasha, is that you?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Tearful Woman]: Dad! — by the Amber Lord, I thought I was never going to see you again!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: Praise the Preservation, my child. Praise THEIR leniency... And who's this little one?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Tearful Woman]: Here, Barry... say hello to grandpa!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Innocent Child]: ...Hello grandpa!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: My grandson... Is this my grandson? *sob*
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Tearful Woman]: Sorry Dad, I wanted to introduce you to my husband too, but he can't get away from the publisher today.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Expectant Gentleman]: That's okay, my child, we've got all the time in the... did you say "publisher"?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: Welcome back to the Administrative District, Trailblazers.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Trailblazers... first time anyone's called us that on this planet!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: The Architects think it's only right that we should address you properly. "Outsiders" is hardly fitting anymore.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: ...Please allow me to apologize again for what happened in the restricted zone. You were only trying to help... I should've trusted Serval's judgment.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: You were just doing your job.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: Thanks for understanding.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Your sister knows what's up...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Ha! Didn't expect to get wrecked, huh?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: You are excellent fighters. I'd love to have you provide training for the Guards, but I know you have places to be.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: Lady Bronya's inaugural address will begin soon. She asked me to pass on her invitation to you.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Huh? That's sooner than I expected. Is she well enough to...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: Not really... But Lady Bronya insisted on delivering the speech as soon as possible. She wants the people to understand what happened.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gepard]: The address will be held at Everwinter Monument. I hope the three of you can find time to attend.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Nervous Silvermane Guard]: U—Uh, excuse me... are you Captain Oleg?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Oleg]: ...Huh? I didn't think anyone would still remember my name after all this time.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Nervous Silvermane Guard]: Of course we remember! Every young guard knows about your courageous exploits!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Oleg]: Oh? Which ones might they be? The time I finished off that rampaging prowler with just three bullets? Or when I defended the outpost from monsters for six days straight without food or water?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Nervous Silvermane Guard]: I haven't heard of either of them actually... But I'd love to hear all about them!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Oleg]: Hahaha, sure! In which case, I'll cut my walk short and tell you all the grisly details...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: I don't know if you've ever had that feeling, ... When you stop and look back on the things you've done, and wonder at all the obstacles you've overcome, the strength you've displayed...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: And then you start to doubt yourself, and wonder if you've lost that drive... If everything were to happen again, would you still stand strong?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: I know the feeling.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: You do? Good... I mean, it's good to know someone in this world feels the same way as me.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: I don't quite understand what you mean.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: And that's not surprising — you're different from others. You seem to radiate a confidence most people don't have.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: I haven't been able to sit back once over the past ten years — a moment's negligence could have brought Wildfire crashing down... and the Underworld would've been beyond saving.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: Staying vigilant wasn't the issue... it was the not knowing whether I'd ever be able to let my guard down again...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Natasha]: No matter what anyone says, I believe your arrival was the reward for my long vigil. Thank you, Trailblazer.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Hook]: Wow! Did you see that, Clara? A super suuuper big steel monster just ran past!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Clara]: I don't think that's a monster... Mr. Svarog's database has information about it. It's called... hmm, I can't remember.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Hook]: Don't worry about the name! The important thing is I saw what it can do — it has a huuuuge appetite and swallows people whole!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Hook]: And it just so happens to be The Moles' next target, hehe... We'll defeat the iron monster and save the people in its tummy!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Clara]: Um... I don't think that's how it works...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gertie]: It's been more than a decade... I'm so glad to see you in the hotel lobby again, Mr. Goethe.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Old Goethe]: Unbelievable... feels like it was just yesterday that I was showing you around the hotel all those years ago. I'm too old to remember a lot of things... but that day I remember clearly as ever.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gertie]: Since the passage between the Overworld and Underworld has opened up again, it's about time we shared some tips with each other, hotel manager to hotel manager.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Old Goethe]: Of course, of course! I was worried before that after losing customers from the Overworld you would go out of business... but your establishment is still alive and well, all thanks to your superb management!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Gertie]: You flatter me, Goethe! My hotel is getting refurbished. I'll be sure to invite you to visit again when the work is all done.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Look! There's a crowd gathering over there. Is the address starting soon?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dan Heng]: Looks like it. Bronya hasn't arrived yet, though. Let's find somewhere to wait.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Miner]: What a historic moment...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Rossy]: Is the address starting soon?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Fizz]: Huh? You're from the Underworld?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Silvermane Guard Announcer]: Guards, formation!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Whoa, this must be it.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Silvermane Guard Announcer]: Citizens of Belobog, I kindly ask for your attention! Lady Bronya Rand's inaugural address will begin shortly. Please remain orderly!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Media]: Trailblaze Mission No Time for Me, My Friend 2.mp4
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: People of Belobog — hear me!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Today we gather here to celebrate our victory... but it was a sacrifice made by a mighty guardian that delivered us this opportunity. She dispelled an evil that cost us 700 years of suffering... and in the process, she paid the ultimate price.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: The sacrifice of Cocolia Rand ushers in a new chapter. The blizzard beyond the walls will die away and the offensives of our Silvermane Guards will begin to contain the Fragmentum's advance.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: In the far north, I witnessed with my own eyes the struggle between the late supreme guardian and the evil power that sought to destroy us. In her last moments, the supreme guardian told me her greatest regret...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Media]: Trailblaze Mission No Time for Me, My Friend 3.mp4
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: ...The order to seal off the Underworld from the Overworld. With the passage of time, she gradually came to realize the consequences of that decision... Although tortured with guilt, she could not undo the damage.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: In her final moments, she wanted us to mark the Stellaron's end by reuniting Belobog. Overworlders and Underworlders must embrace the dawn of a new age... together.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Media]: Trailblaze Mission No Time for Me, My Friend 4 Stelle.mp4      Media:Trailblaze Mission No Time for Me, My Friend 4 Caelus.mp4
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: People of the Underworld, I dare not ask for your forgiveness — I now know the reality of your decade of suffering...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: But I want us to work together. We know that without your perseverance and hard work, Belobog will not recover its former glory... and the seed of civilization will not be preserved.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: ...And on that note, I'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to a few guests of the city.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Most of you were not aware of their arrival... but it is thanks to them that our world now flourishes with hope.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: They made me realize that while we remain focused on "preserving" the ground beneath our feet, we should not forget to look up into the sky.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Media]: Trailblaze Mission No Time for Me, My Friend 5.mp4
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: I firmly believe that with the determination of everyone, our world, the world the Trailblazers call "Jarilo-VI," will no longer be alone among the stars.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: But before we accomplish that goal, I humbly ask you to follow me into the future...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: I, Bronya Rand, the nineteenth guardian of Belobog, hereby take my oath...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Onlookers]: Lady Bronya! Lady Bronya! Long live Belobog!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Bronya, we're back!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: March, Dan Heng, ... it's wonderful you made it to the address.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Sorry, I know the invitation was very last minute... but I needed to get the news out as soon as possible. The longer people waited, the more rumors started to swirl. The situation risked spinning out of control.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Are you fully recovered?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Yes, I'm fine now. Don't worry.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: My mother... she tried to force the voice of the Stellaron into my head... It was a terrible feeling. I don't know what would've happened if you hadn't shown up.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Was Seele not there for the address?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: She was there. She just made sure no one could see her.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Seele is still new to the vastness of the Overworld — she feels uncomfortable in a big crowd... I'll help her adjust to life here.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: That was some speech, Bronya! If I had to talk like that in front of a huge crowd, I'd be shaking head to toe!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: It was all just a bunch of palatable lies. I hope you never have a similar experience, March.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: The part about preserving the seed of civilization was real.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: It's what you do as a leader that matters.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Sometimes people need to hear white lies.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Mm... I'd prefer to be honest with the people... but I also want to preserve their hope.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: ...Dan Heng, wanna... talk about Mr. Yang's findings?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dan Heng]: Mm, allow me to explain.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Telling Bronya about Welt's observations...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: ...Which means the Fragmentum has already taken root by this point. Even though the Stellaron is sealed, we won't be able to reverse the damage immediately...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Stellarons are terrible things.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: I know. Our ancestors wouldn't have risked using one if they'd had other ways of avoiding calamity.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Sorry, we promised you...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: No... No need for apologies.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: You've gone out of your way to save this world. , you nearly lost your life. I have no right to ask for more.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: Besides, I agree with Mr. Yang. Ultimately, the fate of Belobog is in the hands of its own people.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: We will find a way to root out the Fragmentum.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: The Astral Express will do everything within our power to help.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: In that case... as a leader, I must give you a promise of the same weight.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: We will hold out with everything we have until the day you Trailblazers return. Even if it takes another 700 years, the children of Jarilo-VI will look up to the sky with hope in their hearts.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: So long, my friends, May the Preservation bless your journey.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Congrats, ! That was one heck of a first trailblazing expedition!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dan Heng]: Worth celebrating, I'd say.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: On a scale from 1 to 5, how would you rate this journey...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dan Heng and March 7th]: Two point five. Five!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: ...What!? That run-of-the-mill, huh?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Dan Heng]: My scoring criteria are different from yours.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Ugh! Anyway, we should be asking ... Any thoughts you want to share?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Time for a nap...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Wait, what? No way — we're about to leave and hardly got any decent photos.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Come on, let's go back to the Administrative District and hang out for a bit longer!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: I feel like I could fight a hundred more monsters!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: That's the spirit! Come on, we should take some more photos before we head back to the Express.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Let's go! One more round in the Administrative District!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: What will the next adventure be like?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Equally unforgettable, I'm sure. Anyway, don't worry about the future — live in the moment!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][March 7th]: Let's go for one more round in the Administrative District! I wanna take more photos!
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: If you walk with your head down and your heart full of fear, your steps will grow heavier and your spirit will suffer.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: But if you find something to look up to and move forward with hope, then your steps will grow lighter... and if you should fall, you'll be on your feet before you know it.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Bronya]: ...Thank you for teaching me this, Trailblazers.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: The inauguration ceremony went very smoothly. I didn't expect so many Underworlders to come and listen to the address.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: Everyone seemed supportive, too. Seems like Bronya made a pretty good impression on them.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Maybe Natasha and Oleg helped promote her a little.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: Possibly. They always think ahead.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: If those two approve of Bronya, then everyone following Wildfire won't question her either.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: Were you there? I don't think I saw you.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: Of course I was! I was just hidden in the crowd. I'm glad you didn't notice me — means I'm doing something right. I want to protect Bronya in my own way.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: She wanted me to stand next to her, but I'm glad I stuck to my guns. Besides, I'm not sure I could handle that many people staring at me.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: She will be an outstanding leader.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: No doubt. I figured that out back in the Underworld.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Narration]: We're about to leave Belobog.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: Leave...? So soon? I thought you'd stay for a few more days — at least until everything had calmed down...
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: Ahh... I get it. People are waiting for you to go back so you can keep traveling, right?
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: Shame, I thought we'd have more time to discuss all the crazy things you guys like to talk about. Looks like that'll have to wait till next time.
[No Time for Me, My Friend][Seele]: ...And before you say anything, there will be a next time. I know we'll meet again.

[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Bronya said she's willing to wait 700 years for us...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Hmm... Dan Heng, how long can humans live for?
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: ...Forever. But in that scenario, they can't be considered human anymore.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Yikes! So serious! I was just curious.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Here we are, Everwinter Monument! Photo time!
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Oh, Pela and Hook are here too? Let's make sure we get them in the background!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Maybe we could try for a cleaner composition for this one...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Good idea. Let's show them the photos once we're done.
[Silent Galaxy][Hook]: Whoaaaa! So much ice! But it's warm here... aren't you Overworlders worried it'll melt?
[Silent Galaxy][Pela]: Not at all. It may look like ice, but it's actually a monument carved out of Geomarrow crystal.
[Silent Galaxy][Hook]: Ah, Geomarrow! It's a shame daddy isn't here — He'd find a buyer for it and sell it for big bucks!
[Silent Galaxy][Pela]: Uh... How do I explain... This particular piece of Geomarrow is definitely not for sale...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Have a look! I took a photo of everyone.
[Silent Galaxy][Hook]: A "photo?" What's that? Hook wants to see it!
[Silent Galaxy][Pela]: I must remind you that taking photos of others without gaining their permission violates Belobog public security ordinance number...
[Silent Galaxy][Pela]: ...Wait, that's a nice picture! And... it's crystal clear.
[Silent Galaxy][Hook]: Wow! Photos are awesome! ...Can Hook have it?
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Hee-hee, you like it? It's yours. A farewell gift from us.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Okay... Where to next?
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Oh, we haven't seen Serval since we got back! Let's head to the workshop.
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: Who's there? Didn't your parents tell you to knock before—
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: Ha, it's you three! Come on in! I was just talking to Clara about you.
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: How have you been, big ? Miss Serval's workshop is amazing — there are all kinds of things... I like it here a lot!
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: "Miss Serval..." Clara is such a well-mannered kid! Meanwhile, the Architects' children are still calling me "auntie" and making me feel old...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Let's take a photo together!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Still looking to hire assistants for the workshop?
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Hey, that's not your line! We're here to take a photo, remember?
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: Photo? ...This feels like one of my fan meet-ups, haha. Anyway, for you guys, I'd do autographs for free.
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: "Photo..." Oh! I remember. When I was little, Mr. Svarog took a photo for me...
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: Over here, Clara! Wanna learn some cool poses?
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: Wow, that's pretty great! I wish the photographers at my shows had your skills!
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: Huh...? Am I really that short? I thought...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Don't worry! If you eat like Dan Heng, you'll be as tall as him one day! *stifled laughter*
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: ...I'll let that slip.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Here, keep it... a little farewell gift from the Astral Express.
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: ...There's gotta be a better shot than this one!
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: Um... I was trying really hard not to blink...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: *sigh* We shouldn't have trusted an amateur...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Never mind, at least it's memorable... A little farewell gift from the Astral Express.
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: Huh...? You're leaving so soon?
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: *sigh* I understand. Well, this photo will always be close to my heart. I'll make a copy for you too, Clara.
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: Th—Thanks Miss Serval! Big  , March, Dan Heng... Thanks for taking care of me. Safe travels.
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: If you have time... please come back and visit me and Mr. Svarog.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: *yawn* ... That's enough sightseeing and photo-taking to last me a while...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: ...Time to head back to the Goethe Hotel for a good night's sleep!
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: ...We can sleep when we're back on the Express.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Not so fast! Last time we were here, that evil Madam Guardian interrupted us before we'd gotten the most out of our luxury suites... Don't you think we should make up for it?
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Come onnnn! Himeko and Mr. Yang are grown-ups — I'm sure they'll cope without us for one night.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Besides, don't you want to chit-chat with the locals now that Belobog is full of life again? I know I do!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Silent Galaxy
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: I received Bronya's message before the inauguration ceremony. She told me everything that happened north of Belobog — about the Stellaron, and Cocolia's sacrifice...
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: But...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: ...But?
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Uhh... Just listen to Bronya.
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: ...Honestly, I feel that girl is hiding something from me. I knew Cocolia well, and she was never one to suddenly change her mind.
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: *sigh* Don't worry, I won't dig too deep. I know Bronya must have thought long and hard before deciding what to make public.
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: I just... feel a bit empty now that we've lost the Stellaron — I spent a long time pursuing it, after all...
[Silent Galaxy][Serval]: As for Cocolia, the best side of her will live on in people's memory. That's not all bad...
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: Miss Serval is cool, strong, and... carefree...
[Silent Galaxy][Clara]: I want to be like her when I grow up so I can protect everyone... and protect Mr. Svarog!
[Silent Galaxy][Old Goethe]: ...Gertie? It's Gertie, right?
[Silent Galaxy][Gertie]: Mr. Goethe! Long time no see!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Gertie
[Silent Galaxy][Gertie]: It's been more than a decade... I'm so glad to see you in the hotel lobby again, Mr. Goethe.
[Silent Galaxy][Old Goethe]: Unbelievable... feels like it was just yesterday that I was showing you around the hotel all those years ago. I'm too old to remember a lot of things... but that day I remember clearly as ever.
[Silent Galaxy][Gertie]: Since the passage between the Overworld and Underworld has opened up again, it's about time we shared some tips with each other, hotel manager to hotel manager.
[Silent Galaxy][Old Goethe]: Of course, of course! I was worried before that after losing customers from the Overworld you would go out of business... but your establishment is still alive and well, all thanks to your superb management!
[Silent Galaxy][Gertie]: You flatter me, Goethe! My hotel is getting refurbished. I'll be sure to invite you to visit again when the work is all done.
[Silent Galaxy][Alina]: What a spacious lobby...
[Silent Galaxy][Dunya]: My mother lived here as a child, you know.
[Silent Galaxy][Alina]: So can Alina stay here too?
[Silent Galaxy][Dunya]: Yes, let me check with mother about the price...
[Silent Galaxy][Male Guest]: Oh, you're from the Underworld?
[Silent Galaxy][Female Guest]: That's right, born and raised.
[Silent Galaxy][Female Guest]: Is something wrong?
[Silent Galaxy][Male Guest]: No, it's just surprising...
[Silent Galaxy][Male Guest]: After all, you are very dignified in your speech.
[Silent Galaxy][Sampo]: Aw, it was a close thing alright! Good thing it dawned on me: Hey, Sampo doesn't have to be a protagonist, right? The likes of us are better suited to... shadowy comic relief, huh?
[Silent Galaxy][Sampo]: Turns out the Astral Express crew is more fun than I expected! You liked it? Really? Haha, told you so!
[Silent Galaxy][Sampo]: ...No no, I'm in no hurry to leave. What? Oh, Epsilon? Pff. What fun can you get out of a giant vanity fair like that? "True happiness always entails the manifestation of the dignity of mankind..." Now that's a quote I live by.
[Silent Galaxy][Sampo]: Well, bye for now. Send my regards to the guys and girls in the tavern. Oh, and don't forget to say that Sampo Koski will catch them for the next one. Time to make my curtain call.
[Silent Galaxy][Sampo]: To you, my dear audience, I dedicate my performance... I wonder, did I bring a little more joy into your lives?
[Silent Galaxy][Sampo]: ...You don't have to answer that — but if the answer is no, then you'll break my heart.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: : We should be getting back to the Express. Time to find March and Dan Heng.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: MessagesThe Astral Express FamilyHimeko, March, Dan Heng... How was your rest?Pom-Pom has completed the routine pre-departure inspection, so the Nameless is ready to move on to the next world. Come back to the Express when you've tied up all the loose endsOh, right. You must have so many questions about that final battle with the Supreme Guardian of Belobog. Welt and I made some simple analyses that might help shed some light on it for youMarch 7thGot it! We will start our preparations now
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Morning, ! How did you sleep? I'm full of energy myself!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: I'm full of energy myself!
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: ...Copycatitis still has no cure I see.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: I dreamed about Sampo...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: You poor thing! I'll go check the lunar calendar — today might be unlucky.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: It's time we went home!
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: *sigh* But the beds here are so nice!
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: Did you get Himeko's message? It's time to go. The conductor will nag us again if we put the Express behind schedule.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Yeah, yeah. Well, pack your souvenirs and stuff. Back home we go!
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Here we are at last... *sigh* It's sad to say goodbye.
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: Nothing lasts forever. You'll stop feeling sad the moment you set foot on the Express.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Hey, I'm not that heartless y'know...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Leave Jarilo-VI and return to the Express.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: I want to have one last look at this world...
[Silent Galaxy][Seele]: ...Priorities? What do you mean? Are you saying rebuilding the Underworld isn't one of your "priorities"?
[Silent Galaxy][Bronya]: Of course not! I'm just saying we have limited assets, and we need new parameters.
[Silent Galaxy][Seele]: Assets... parameters... You sure love your fancy words.
[Silent Galaxy][Seele]: Ugh, forget it. Leave it to me. I'll go down myself...
[Silent Galaxy][Bronya]: ...Come on, Seele! I won't leave you to—
[Silent Galaxy][Seele]: Look, Bronya!
[Silent Galaxy][Bronya]: ...!
[Silent Galaxy][Bronya]: There'll be plenty of difficulties waiting for them, right?
[Silent Galaxy][Seele]: Yes... their future is filled with even more uncertainty than ours.
[Silent Galaxy][Bronya]: But we will prevail here... Even if it means arguments like this go on forever...
[Silent Galaxy][Seele]: ...Hmph, they won't go on forever if I win them.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Welcome home, you three.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Himeko, Mr. Yang! Team Trailblaze, back from duty! Mission one: Accomplished!
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: *chuckles* Although Welt and I didn't get the chance to go with you, I can tell you worked hard to bring things back to normal. Well done, everybody. And especially you, . I heard a lot of good things about you.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: How would you rate my performance?
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: I'd say it's a solid five stars.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Piece of cake.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Confidence goes a long way.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Can I skip the next mission and get some rest?
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: *chuckles* And miss out on a great adventure? I don't think you'd like that.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Get some rest on the Express. Jarilo-VI was not an easy ride.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Pom-Pom is of the opinion that we should leave as soon as possible to avoid potential resurgences of the anomalies we experienced earlier. Himeko and I agree.
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: ...Which means we need to decide where our next destination is, soon.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: That's right.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: That's the path of the Nameless, I presume? Always on the road, always trailblazing...
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: I—I'm not complaining by the way! One adventure after another, that's exactly what I signed up for!
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Looks like March has fallen in love with the way of the Nameless. That's good to hear.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: You can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
[Silent Galaxy][Dan Heng]: I'll head back to my room then.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: *sighs* There I was thinking this guy would gradually open up...
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: *chuckles* We need to give him some time, March. I think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: , about your battle against the Supreme Guardian and the whole Stellaron situation, you must have a lot of unanswered questions, I suppose?
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: While you were away, Welt and I did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. Let me know if you want to ask about anything.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Home, sweet home! Mr. Yang and Himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Where's our next stop? I can't wait!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Shhh! Checking star rail stability, Pom-Pom needs to focus!
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: The Express crew tread upon the Trailblaze. We travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: The universe is vast beyond our imagination. It's a miracle that our paths converge. The fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Thank you for becoming our companion, . I'll do my best to answer any questions you may have.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: I'd like to talk about the battle with Cocolia.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Sure. Oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. I hope as an onlooker I may provide some help.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: About the Path of Preservation...
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Qlipoth the Preservation is known for their... indifference. Unless you become a zealot like those with the Corporation, it's hard to share in the Aeon's power.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Determined to preserve the world they love, the Architects held on for hundreds of years. But as the Fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: And one particular guardian, Cocolia, abandoned the Path of Preservation altogether. In contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the Amber Lord.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Judging by how the battle turned out, Qlipoth responded to your wish. Their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the Colossus.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: I was meant to thank you for your support during the battle.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: *chuckles* Don't mention it. Welt and I may have stayed on the Express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on Jarilo-VI.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Friends look after each other, the same goes for us Nameless. Please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the Express will always be behind you.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: The source of Cocolia's power...
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: ...is a Stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: What I've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the Stellaron at a very young age. All the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point...
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: On the flip side, we can't judge Cocolia too harshly. Imagine if it were you or me who had to sit on the throne and watch the city slowly being brought to its knees... Would we not question what we believed in?
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Let's talk about something else.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Sure, ask away. We've got plenty of time.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Can Jarilo-VI go back to what it was like before the Stellaron?
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: Welt may be better equipped to answer that. But if you want my two cents...
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: I'd say it's unlikely. I guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: I can tell from your report that the new Supreme Guardian of Belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. What's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: The firm and honest support she gets from people around her will also prove immensely useful. But fate likes to play tricks on people. Even if during their lifetime they managed to make Jarilo-VI prosper again to a certain degree...
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: They will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. We can only give them our best wishes from afar.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: What happened to the Stellaron?
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: It's virtually impossible to destroy a Stellaron. No one, not even Herta, has found a way to break its structure. The best we can do at this stage is to prevent its energy from overflowing.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: When the supreme guardian was defeated, the Stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing Welt and I to contain its power.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: That's about all we can do about a Stellaron. It may be suppressed for now, but it's only a matter of time before it regains power.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: But this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Thanks for your patience, Himeko.
[Silent Galaxy][Himeko]: You're most welcome, . Have some rest, you've earned it.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: So, your first trailblazing expedition has concluded. How do you feel, ?
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Be it joy or pain, success or regret, it's all part of the journey. Those feelings will accompany you as long as you tread on the Trailblaze, and one day you'll grow used to them.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: It seems you have something on your mind. Let's hear it. I'd like to hear a fresh perspective myself... Hehe, as talkative as Himeko is, we've pretty much run out of topics.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: The Fragmentum and the Eternal Freeze... will they disappear?
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: I'm afraid not.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: As I've mentioned before, the Stellaron's influence on Jarilo-VI is more profound than we might think. I don't think Belobog's fight against the lingering effects of the Stellaron will end any time soon.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: But, the balance of power is tilting ever so slightly towards humanity, the crucial factor being the hope you brought about.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: As intangible as it may sound, don't underestimate hope because the power it inspires has no limit. Like the Stellaron, it's a seed that may grow into something much bigger. But in my opinion, the fruit that hope bears will have a much bigger impact than that of the Stellaron.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: I relayed your view of the Stellaron's effects to Bronya.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Is that so? Well, I think you did the right thing. It's better to move forward with the burden of knowledge than to tread a perilous road with blind optimism.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: I remember a distant world where the people were faced with unimaginable danger every single day. But they saved their planet time after time with wisdom and courage.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: This goes to show how much of a difference ordinary people can make. I hope Jarilo-VI sees that too.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: This mission would've been much easier if you were there.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Hehe... I, too, wished to go with you. But Himeko insisted on letting you and your friends rise to the challenge.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: I'd been observing what's happening on the ground from the Express, and I have to admit that I got sweaty palms a couple of times. I was glad to see you three meet friends you could trust and overcome hardships. Well done.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Himeko was calm from the very beginning. She kept telling me to trust you youngsters' decisions.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Hehe... And she was right. I really need to stop worrying so much.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: It's been nice chatting with you, Mr. Yang.
[Silent Galaxy][Welt]: Likewise. Get some sleep, we'll be heading off again soon.
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Pom-Pom, we're back!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Shhh! Checking star rail stability, Pom-Pom needs to focus!
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Good to see you too...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Spatial readout... back to the normal bracket!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Star rail stability keeps rising... 56%, 57%...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The numbers have stabilized! Dispatch the Express!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Oh, welcome back to the Express. You've accomplished your Trailblaze Mission, the Express appreciates your help!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: How's the Express doing?
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Thanks to you, the Space Fissure is healing up, and the star rail has become stable enough for us to dispatch the Express...
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: As for the coaches, Pom-Pom's checked every nook and cranny and made sure everything is in good order!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Oops, I forgot to bring you souvenirs.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Don't worry about it! Jarilo-VI probably doesn't have anything worth buying anyway. Plus, it's your first time on a Trailblaze Mission, so Pom-Pom will let it slide this time!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: But don't forget next time!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Where's our next stop?
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The destination will be announced at the navigation meeting.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: For now, get some rest and stay tuned!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Need to get some juice for March.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Oh, Pom-Pom almost forgot!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: There you go, careful not to spill it!
[Silent Galaxy][March 7th]: Thank you, conductor!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: When are we leaving, conductor?
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Right away!
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: To avoid encountering the anomalies again, the Express will dispatch shortly and head to a more stable area.
[Silent Galaxy][Narration]: Pom-Pom: For your safety, please don't leave your seat until the Express has reached cruising speed!

[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Rest
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Hello? Hello hello?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: It's about time we hit the road, passengers! Thanks to the three trailblazers, the activity of the Fragmentum has reached the lowest level, and the readings regarding the status of the star rail have returned to normal!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom will dispatch the Express shortly and we'll be leaving Jarilo-VI. Please be seated and say your goodbyes to this planet!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: The Xianzhou Luofu — The Shackling Prison
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Yanqing]: Yes, general.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Jing Yuan]: Watch this person carefully.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Jing Yuan]: ...Do you remember me?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: I remember.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: Of five people...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: Three must pay a price.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: You are not one of them, Jing Yuan.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: Hehe... Of five people...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: Three must pay a price.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Blade]: You... are one of them.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: Hold on, I... I'll be there soon.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: What did I tell you, ? He's definitely sleeping in.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: We Trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. Anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: The conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. Same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Let's head over. Oh, by the way...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: You drew the short straw, . It's your turn to wash the coffee cups this week.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: See, it's like I said: If you wake up and Dan Heng's not around, then you probably won't see him the rest of the day either.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Didn't Himeko say not to worry?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: I guess. To be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. You don't have to show up, but Himeko might be upset if you don't.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Think about it, Dan Heng's the one managing the archives — he'll already be clued in to our next destination. Himeko and Welt know already, of course... so it's just me and you in the dark!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Dan Heng sure is a mysterious guy.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Yeah... I heard he did something incredible once, and now some powerful force has his name on a wanted list. My guess is the Xianzhou Alliance or the Garden of Recollection. In any case, it can't be the IPC — I've seen their wanted list.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Hmm... I bet it is the Garden of Recollection. Didn't it seem like Dan Heng was super keen on talking to Herta? Everyone knows that Herta and the Garden of Recollection don't get along. They say the enemy of your enemy is your friend...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: How shocking...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Ha! Shocking? I guess you're still new — you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: What's with the funny look? Am I not strange enough for you? Name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. I already made up a few dozen for myself.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: You're looking well, .
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: You coming with us this time?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Haha, you better believe it. You guys really put on a show for Jarilo-VI — I'm eager to join in myself.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: I gotta say, there were more than a few times where I wanted to lend a hand... but Himeko said I should let you youngsters rise to the trailblazing challenges...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Do you know what our next destination is?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: I know alright, but I can't tell you yet. Himeko wants to create a sense of mystery for you and March.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: What world do you want to go to?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: That I want to go to? ...My home world, I suppose. Sadly, its location doesn't appear on the Express's astral chart records, at least the ones that are undamaged.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: In any case, I do want to see some other civilizations before I go home. It'd be a crime to waste this opportunity on the Express.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem... , did you receive the destination overview? Excited?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Himeko's going to announce it in the meeting.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: So you don't know yet...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: We got it.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You don't seem very excited...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: After all that cold and exhaustion on Jarilo-VI, you must be looking forward to the next planet!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I like all planets equally!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom's thrilled that you're enjoying your journey!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: A long, long time ago, this train would ferry the Nameless from planet to planet... Now it's able to do the same again.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: When will we get to Pegana?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pegana? That's the final stop — Akivili's home world... Pom-Pom wants to visit again too. Unfortunately, the journey's a lot like life — you don't always get where you're going right away.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Are these destination overviews still useful after a thousand years?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...There are some planets that haven't been affected by Stellarons.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express moves at an incredible speed, but change is always faster...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: , if you're ready, head over to the front of the train. The meeting is about to start!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: , if you're ready, head over to the front of the train. The meeting is about to start!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Morning, . You're very punctual.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: And a wonderful morning to you, Himeko.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: *sigh* I can't remember the last time I got such a polite response.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Punctual is my middle name.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Well hang onto it, it's cute.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I'm reporting Dan Heng for—
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Ah, no need to worry, Dan Heng's rarely late. I'm sure he must have a good reason...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Dan Heng's situation is special — we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The trailblazing of Jarilo-VI has drawn to a close, and the Astral Express must depart for the next planet.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: What's the next planet like?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Not telling yet... We'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but I'm keeping you in suspense for now~
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Trailblazing really is a full-time job, huh.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends... Even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. That's the beauty of the unknown.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Any chance for a little break first?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: That hardly sounds like you, . What about that Stellaron inside you? Don't you wanna get rid of it?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The meeting will start soon.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The meeting will start soon.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Passengers! The warp navigation meeting has officially begun!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Firstly, Pom-Pom wants to congratulate you, the Nameless, for successfully resolving the problems at this stop. The Express is now able to continue along the star rail!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: The three of us actually pulled it off, huh !
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: It's time for your conductor — ahem, that's me — to reveal the name of our next stop...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Long time no see, Astral Express crew.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: It's Kafka.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: I came at a good time. You're all here...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Every single one.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: No need for the mysterious introduction...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Stellaron Hunter.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Himeko... correct?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Apologies for interrupting your little get-together.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: But I'm sure once you've heard my request...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: ...you'll forgive me.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: I'd like you to make a...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: ...destination alteration.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: I've seen your face before, Stellaron Hunter, even if it was only on a Corporation wanted poster. They were offering quite the bounty... dead or alive. Do you know the figure?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Doesn't concern me. Then again, a Corporation bounty is a compliment, not an insult, don't you think? The higher the figure, the bigger the compliment.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: You wanted criminals sure know how to look on the bright side of things...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...I will say, Herta certainly paid you all a compliment: "A maniac that claims he can see destiny, leading a bunch of wild lunatics in pursuit of the most dangerous objects in the universe!" ...And Herta doesn't give out compliments very often.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: In pursuit of the most dangerous objects in the universe, huh? ...In that sense, you Astral Expressers and I are cut from the same cloth.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: You're in the wrong place, Kafka. We're not about to accept your request, and we're not about to get into bed with a Stellaron Hunter. It was nice talking with you. Perhaps next time you'll be willing to pay us a visit in person and we can continue our little discussion.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Have you guys heard of the Luofu?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...The Xianzhou Luofu? It belongs to the Hexafleet of the Xianzhou Alliance. We've heard of it.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Mm. But what you haven't heard is that it's currently very close to you — a couple of warp jumps away, in fact.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Not to mention, 45 system hours ago... a Stellaron burst occurred on the Luofu.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: An unexpected calamity... don't you think?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: What exactly are you Stellaron Hunters trying to do...? The Xianzhou Alliance aren't us — they won't give you time to explain. Once you draw the attention of The Hunt, you become their prey. The Alliance will hunt you to the end of the universe...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Stop speaking in riddles, Kafka. Say what you have to say.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: ...It's simple. That Stellaron has nothing to do with us, but the Xianzhou is convinced that we're responsible.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: My companion Blade has been taken away by the Cloud Knights. I want to bring him back, resolve this Stellaron crisis, and clear our names.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Nothing to do with you? Yeah right — sounds like a weird coincidence to me. You just happened to show up after the Stellaron burst...?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Also, we're not your friends. Why should we care if a Stellaron Hunter is innocent, hmm~?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: We should seal the Stellaron and help the Xianzhou.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Maybe we can sell our friendship to the Stellaron Hunters.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Is there anything in this for us?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: No! Why are we listening to her? The Alliance is strong — is a single Stellaron burst really too much for them to handle? We're the crew of the Astral Express, not some squad of Stellaron-sealing super specialists!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: You could, of course, not get involved. Knowing that the Stellaron hasn't yet affected this region of space, you could make the jump and arrive at the next world. But sooner or later, the star rail here will be more blocked off than it was before.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: I can tell you what the future holds: If you don't go to the Luofu, the Stellaron will eventually contaminate the entire ship, and over half of the inhabitants will perish.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Oh you brave and fearless Trailblazers, you benevolent Nameless, can you really remain indifferent to that?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...This companion of yours, Blade, he'd perish too, right?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: No comment.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Here are the coordinates. It's up to you how to proceed.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Kafka]: Our destinations may differ, but the orbits of the stars will eventually converge. See you later.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...March, get Dan Heng.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Kafka... *sigh* Pom-Pom doesn't like her. She smells of danger.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Still, a Trailblazer should choose their goal and the road they take to get there themselves. That's the creed of the great Akivili.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: , what do you think about all this?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: We should go to the Xianzhou.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Oh? And why is that?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Because we're the Nameless.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Haha, I see you're already a full-fledged Trailblazer. You're right, we can't remain indifferent to those in crisis.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Because the Xianzhou needs us.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Haha, I see you're already a full-fledged Trailblazer. You're right, we can't remain indifferent to those in crisis.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Because we can't not go.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: We can't trust everything Kafka says. It's credible that the leader of the Stellaron Hunters can predict the future, but Kafka might not be telling the truth.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...This is a difficult matter. If she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the Luofu will be in great danger.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: We can't go to the Xianzhou.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Oh? How come?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: We can't trust what Kafka says.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: You're right. It's credible that the leader of the Stellaron Hunters can predict the future, but Kafka might not be telling the truth.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...This is a difficult matter. If she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the Luofu will be in great danger.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: The Stellaron Hunters are up to something.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: It wouldn't be surprising. I've seen the IPC's file on Blade. If the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: It's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the Cloud Knights and that the Stellaron Hunters would look to us for help.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: This has nothing to do with us.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Yes, however... if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the Luofu will be in great danger.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I'm okay with whatever we do.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: I like the way you think.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: , did you notice that Kafka didn't mention anything to do with you...?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Maybe Blade's more important.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I have nothing to do with her anymore.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: It seemed like she was avoiding it.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Hmm...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: A Stellaron Hunter implanted you with a Stellaron — a move like that hints at a far-off purpose. Everyone says that Elio can foresee the future, and that every step of his schemes is a foreshadowing.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: You must be extra vigilant, . Kafka won't always turn a blind eye.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The Xianzhou Alliance... I've heard of them, but never had any contact with them.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: How could the mighty Xianzhou Alliance be breached by a Stellaron...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: What do you make of it, Mr. Yang?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Something's not right. The Xianzhou Alliance is a small faction, but one that derives its power directly from an Aeon. They have immense strength — much more than a train under the protection of the fallen Akivili.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Stellarons can lead to the collapse of stars scattered throughout the universe, but the Xianzhou has Lan, The Hunt on their side. I struggle to believe that Stellarons pose a threat in the eyes of the Aeons.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Either the Stellaron Hunters are lying, or... there's an even bigger threat lurking on the Xianzhou Luofu...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Is the Xianzhou Alliance really that powerful?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: It's fair to say that it ranks highly among the known forces in the universe.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: The Path of The Hunt is narrow and doesn't stand out among the other Paths, but the Alliance enjoys the direct blessing of the Aeon. The six great ships of the Xianzhou are like brothers in arms.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Its power is much greater than those factions that simply draw their strength from the Paths themselves.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: This is big. I'm coming with you this time.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: This is big. I'm coming with you this time.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I want to hear your thoughts.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Something's not right — the Xianzhou has Lan The Hunt's blessing. I struggle to believe that Stellarons pose a threat in the eyes of the Aeons...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...Which means either the Stellaron Hunters are lying, or... there's an even bigger threat lurking on the Xianzhou Luofu.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I want to know more about the Xianzhou Alliance.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: The Alliance is made up of six great ships, all following Lan, The Hunt. Its mission is to eliminate the Aeon of Abundance.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Lan doesn't rank among the more powerful Aeons — the concept of the Path of The Hunt is narrow... but in contrast with the other Aeons, THEY pay close attention to mortals. Lan grants strength to the Xianzhou Alliance without reservation.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: It follows that the Alliance's marshal and six generals are in no way inferior to Lord Ravagers.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Are you allowed to divulge our original destination...?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: I guess it doesn't matter if I tell you now... Our original destination was a place called Penacony. The records on the Express indicate that it's a prison planet used by the IPC to exile criminals — at least that's how it was in the days of Akivili.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: When the Cancer of All Worlds broke out, the IPC lost control of Penacony, and the planet sought refuge under Xipe the Harmony. Now it's a member of "The Family."
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Penacony is holding an event, and The Family sent an invitation to the Express. Himeko intends to accept the invitation, so we were planning to travel there as guests, not Trailblazers.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...But alas, for now we're changing our bearings and heading for the Xianzhou.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I won't disturb you.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Whoa, what are you doing here?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: ...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: I just gave him the low-down. Hey, remember what I said, okay? We're gonna vote against it! I'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: ...Seems like the longer I spend in my room, the stranger things are when I emerge.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: We might be going to the Xianzhou Luofu.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: Mm, March told me... *sigh* If it were one of the other ships it might've been okay, but I can't go to the Luofu.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: So you and the Luofu have history?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: I'm forbidden from setting foot on that ship. "Total interception of any attempt to enter the dominion" is how they chose to put it. *sigh*
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: ...So if you're planning on going, I can't go with you.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Other ships? Which ones?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: The Alliance is made up of six ships — the Luofu is only one of them.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: There are also the Yaoqing, the Fanghu, the Zhuming, the Xuling, and the Yuque.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Well, that's up to you.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: I remember the Xianzhou was a sight to behold. Good luck.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: I'm forbidden from setting foot on the Luofu. "Total interception of any attempt to enter the dominion." *sigh* Let's head back to the main carriage.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: It's waaaay too much of a coincidence. A Stellaron Hunter shows up at the site of a Stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. Does anyone really believe that?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: I'm so mad! She just hijacks our communications and then hangs up? So rude! , you used to know her, right? Was she always like this?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I don't remember.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: ...We don't need another amnesiac on this train...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: She used to be nice.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Oh yeah? Huh, maybe she really liked you...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Pfft, taking things seriously all of a sudden...?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Oh yeah, I just spoke to Dan Heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Doesn't Himeko have the final say?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. One for you, one for me, one for Dan Heng — three altogether. We never go anywhere without a consensus.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I want to vote in favor.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Hmph, I should've known you'd listen to that Stellaron Hunter. Whatever — but you should think before you do that.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Ugh, I'm so annoyed.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Are you okay, Dan Heng? March brought you up to speed, I assume?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: I'm fine, and yes, I'm up to speed.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Good. In that case, with regard to the matter at hand, let's vote to decide our next move.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Our Stellaron Hunter claims that a Stellaron burst has occurred on the Xianzhou Luofu, and that we're in the vicinity. If we head for the Luofu, we may have the chance to save many innocent lives.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...However, it's also possible that our Stellaron Hunter is lying and using us for her own ends. Neither Welt nor I believe that she's telling us the truth, but we can't just ignore the intel she's given us...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: So, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the Xianzhou. All those in favor, hold out your hand. All those against, keep your arms by your side.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Three, two, one...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Hands out!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Four against one. Well, it looks like the Astral Express crew has a majority vote to head for the Xianzhou!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Arms by my side!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Three against two. Well, it looks like the Astral Express crew has a majority vote to head for the Xianzhou!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Wait, what am I supposed to do!?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Three against two. Well, it looks like the Astral Express crew has a majority vote to head for the Xianzhou!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Didn't you say you were voting against!?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: *sigh* I calmed down and thought about it a bit. If it turns out that woman isn't lying, then a lot of innocent people are gonna get hurt... Now's the time for thinking about other people... hehe *sigh*
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Oh, how suddenly principled of you!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: You're so capricious!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Alright, alright, I think we're all used to March's modus operandi by now.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: So, Dan Heng, you want to stay here?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: Yes, I'm staying this time.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: In that case... Welt. Ready for a trailblazing expedition? I know you've been itching to get out there for a while now. But make sure you take good care of  and March.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...Don't worry.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Destination Xianzhou, here we come!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The train is about to make the jump!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Hold on, everyone!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 5
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 4
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 3
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 2
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 1
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Whoa! So that's a Xianzhou ship? It looks even bigger than Jarilo-VI!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: For Xianzhou natives, these ships are their planets.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: Terrestrial environments are cradles that allow civilizations to survive and then develop. Some of those civilizations progress further — constructing space-faring vessels which allow them to voyage into the unknown... The Xianzhou Alliance is one such civilization.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: I've only glimpsed it a few times, but... it's as magnificent as I remember...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: You okay there? What's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: ...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: This is the Astral Express, I repeat, this is the Astral Express. We have arrived in Xianzhou territory. Requesting landing permission from ground control... f—from the bridge, I mean.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Intermittent Signal]: Welcome to... Luofu skyport... Starskiff Haven...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Intermittent Signal]: Please await transfer... Please await transfer... Please await transfer...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Is it stuck on repeat?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: *sigh* Now you know how I feel when you copy me.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Sounds like one of those automated customer service numbers...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...Something's not right.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Maybe the Stellaron Hunters were telling the truth. It seems like something really did happen to the Xianzhou...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: A vessel arrives at a deserted spaceport... Isn't that how, like, loads of horror movies start!?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: Let's not let our imaginations get the better of us.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Intermittent Signal]: Please await transfer... Please await transfer... Please await transfer...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Still the automated signal?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Yes, it's still on repeat... Ah! There we go.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Intermittent Signal]: ...The Jade Gate is now opening. On behalf of the Xianzhou Luofu: Welcome, guests from afar. Please proceed to dock in accordance with the guidance...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Huh? Is this still automated?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: The signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: We should get going. Himeko, stay vigilant back here on the Express.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Relax, I've got Dan Heng here with me.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: You're staying too?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Yes, but I won't be putting my feet up. There's a lot to take care of here on the train.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I don't wanna go...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Come onnnn, you were the most excited last time we got off the train!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Trailblazers! Assemble~!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Have a safe trip you guys!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Why not come with us, Pom-Pom?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom's too busy — looking after the Express is a full-time job.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Have you visited the Xianzhou before, Pom-Pom?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Never.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Don't worry about me — I'm just happy you're enjoying the journey.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: :
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: This time you'll get the chance to witness Welt in action, haha. I'm glad he's going with you.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: So Welt's got skills?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: He doesn't talk much about his past. If you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...But that's only a small part of his story. Believe me when I say he has more experience than I do.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: I knew there was more to him than meets the eye...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: You could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. If you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: ...But that's only a small part of his story. Believe me when I say he has more experience than I do.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Don't worry, I'll take care of March and him.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Himeko]: Haha, much appreciated, .
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a Xianzhou ship that Dan Heng spent time on? That's gotta be fate! I wonder what Dan Heng stories await us.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: That guy sure has a mysterious past. We gotta take this opportunity on the Luofu to dig into it!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Darn straight.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: I knew you'd be excited! Check out the master of gossip over here.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Give the man some privacy, please.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: *sigh* Fine, you're right... In that case, we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: That might be dangerous...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Huh? Is his past really that dark?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: *sigh* Fine, I'll leave him alone then. We'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: :
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Dan Heng]: You need to take extra care on this expedition. I've compiled some intel on the Xianzhou for you, I hope it comes in useful.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Before we set off, I need to clarify the aim of this journey with you...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: The Stellaron Hunters have given us a lot to consider, and a lot to doubt... But the most important part of this expedition is—
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Sampling the local delicacies.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Always thinking with your stomach. What about all the scenic photo opportunities?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Getting to know the people with power.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: That Belobog expedition got in your head, huh...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: The Stellaron.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Precisely.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: The Stellaron Hunters clearly have ulterior motives. However, knowing what they're all about and given the focus of Kafka's words, I have no doubt that the Xianzhou is dealing with a Stellaron.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: The Alliance and the Express haven't had any previous dealings, so our arrival might not receive the warmest welcome. But as Trailblazers, we're not in this for fame or gain — we just need to do everything in our power to assist the Xianzhou and eliminate the source of disaster.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Always keep that in mind, and don't forget the way of the trailblaze: Explore, understand, establish, and connect.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Yeahhhh~!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: ...Let's go!
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Ugh, Look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: This area isn't for receiving guests, it's for unloading cargo! Who decided to send us this way?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Such a huge port and not a soul in sight. It gives me the creeps...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: At this point, I think it'd be creepier if we did see someone...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: Yet someone opened the gate for us...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Ah! Stop talking! If there is someone here, they're in my bad books already.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Mr. Yang, what should we do?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: We should start with the person who opened the Jade Gate. If it turns out they're not friendly, then at least they've already made things easier for us. If it turns out they were just doing their job, then we can ask them what happened here.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: You're pretty decisive...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: That's Mr. Yang — this is child's play for him. He's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Narration]: What if they're not friendly and we can't defeat them...?
[An Invitation Without Proffer][March 7th]: Are you forgetting we've got Mr. Yang with us? Oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet...
[An Invitation Without Proffer][Welt]: Let's move. Keep your wits about you.

[Amidst the Mara-Struck][???]: ...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Mr. Yang, someone's hurt...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: ...Up... Up ahead...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: You're hurt, son. Try not to talk.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: March, use your six-phased ice to stop the bleeding. Go easy, we don't wanna add frostbite to his list of complaints.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: I'm on it~
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: , March, this area saw fierce fighting only recently.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Let's keep searching, there might be other survivors.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: ...Up ahead... Please, leave me...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: There are wounded everywhere...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: The silver lining is that based on what we can see, no civilians were caught up in the battle...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: I'm guessing the Xianzhou must have evacuated the port immediately, leaving the soldiers to deal with the crisis. But as for these corroded monsters...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: ...Up ahead... Please, leave me...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Careful, we've never seen this kind of life form before...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Awaiting orders, Mr. Yang!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Miss Tingyun! Fall back!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: They're mara-struck — we've already lost them...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][???]: Hey, you there! We need your help~!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][???]: Thanks for saving beauty from the beast~
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Pleasure! But are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Miss Tingyun, the mara-struck have been repelled, b—but there could be other dangers nearby.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: The situation is serious. Allow us to escort you back to the Sky-Faring Commission, immediately.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Calm down, I heard you. It'd be rude of me to depart without thanking our benefactors.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: My name is Tingyun. I'm the Amicassador for the Luofu Sky-Faring Commission merchant guild. May I venture to know the illustrious names of my heroes?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Illustrious names? ...Uhh, sure. I'm March 7th, this is Mr. Yang — oh — Mr. Welt Yang, and this is—
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: I'm .
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: My name's a secret.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Oh... hehe.  Secret.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Don't mind .  likes to get a little creative with  introductions.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Trying to avoid ending up on another wanted list...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Best not to reveal our true names...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Next time, why not remind me before I give up my name?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: I'm... the Galactic Baseballer.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: *chuckle* What a heroic-sounding name.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Don't mind .  likes to get a little creative with  introductions.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: I'm just trying to avoid ending up on another wanted list.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Best to use a fake name...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Next time, why not remind me before I give up my name?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: I see, well, thank you for coming to our aid. Although, there is one thing I don't understand: Starskiff Haven is under lockdown. Since none of you are Xianzhou residents, may I ask how you came to be here?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: If you can't offer an explanation, I'm afraid these Cloud Knights will have to escort you out.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: We called for port transfer and got no response, but then someone opened the Jade Gate for us. When we arrived there was no one to be found, so we started to make our own way through.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: How can that be? My ship was the last one into port before the Jade Gate was shut. The Sky-Faring Commission has already locked down Starskiff Haven entirely...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: We're telling the truth. You could verify it yourself by checking the access history of the Jade Gate.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: W—We found it strange ourselves when the gate opened but no one came to greet us.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: ...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: You're with... the Astral Express?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: You've heard of us?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Indeed I have. *sigh* ...You've arrived at a bad time — the Xianzhou has suffered an incident. Whether you're here for leisure, treatment, or trade, I'm afraid you won't be able to go through with it.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: For your safety, you should hurry to Central Starskiff Haven and take refuge. I'll take you to Madam Yukong of the Sky-Faring Commission and let her decide how to proceed.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: We caught wind of the incident you mention. That's why we're here Miss Tingyun — to help the Xianzhou seal the Stellaron.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Hehe, your actions have already revealed your kind hearts to me! Sadly... I can't make you any promises. You're outsiders, and only Madam Yukong has the authority to consider your offer.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Don't worry! Madam Yukong is kind-hearted too. Come on now, I'll lead the way.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Those monsters back there...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Cloud Knights Soldier]: They were no monsters!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Those were not to be confused with monsters, benefactors. We call them mara-struck.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Why have we stopped?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Don't worry, Miss. I have a favor to ask, that's all.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Favor...? Count me out. What if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: *sigh* I shouldn't have doubted you, please accept my apologies. Our road ahead is barricaded, do you see?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: The soldiers stationed here must have moved these into a roadblock.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Let's push them aside together?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: I'm sure Mr. Yang could clear them out...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: What? Does he look like a crane to you?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: I'd like to see us try, haha... they're extremely heavy. Even with all of us, we wouldn't be able to move one.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Not that I'm doubting your skill, but I'd feel terrible if you hurt yourself in the process.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: If I'm not mistaken, the containers in the Trove of Verdure can be moved around using a control panel.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: You've already put on quite the show — do you think you'll be able to find and operate the control panel? Should be simple, right?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Right!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: I knew it. This will be a breeze for you.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Right! So why don't you do it?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Oh, I'm afraid I'm not built for hard labor...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: She sure knows how to boss people around.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: We just need to pass through here, take the barge to Starskiff Haven, and we'll be safe.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your Cloud Knights. If it weren't for Mr. Yang...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: You misunderstand. If you were in my shoes right now, wouldn't you want to keep your guard up~?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: True... But we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: You mentioned the Stellaron...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: You work for the Sky-Faring Commission, so I assume you're aware of its destructive power.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Yes, I am. As an Amicassador, I've been to many planets, and seen my fair share of Stellaron corrosion... *sigh*
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Get ready, and watch your backs.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Leave it to me!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: *sigh* Finally. Look how many tail hairs I lost on the way. Tsk, my beautiful tail...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: We had a difficult start, but things got easier. Look, that's the barge I was talking about.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Anyone... got a license for this thing?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Don't fret. All Amicassadors know their way around a starskiff.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Is this... manual or automatic?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Don't fret. All Amicassadors know their way around a starskiff.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Nice! I'm driving!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Uh-uh. Just sit back, and relax. All Amicassadors know their way around a starskiff.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: I was perfectly calm until she volunteered to help...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Please take your seats, everyone. We'll be off right away.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Leave
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: On behalf of the Sky-Faring Commission, allow me to welcome you to Starskiff Haven.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: On the Xianzhou Luofu, anything relating to aviation, navigation, and trade falls within the scope of the Sky-Faring Commission, which is one of the six commissions of the Luofu. As the biggest port on the ship, Starskiff Haven is governed by the Sky-Faring Commission, too.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: You definitely sound like a... what was it again...? Oh, Amicassador! By which I mean — nice speech.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: That's too kind of you. My job involves ferrying business delegates to and from Starskiff Haven, so I do this kind of introduction all the time.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Anyway, we're safe now. Normally I'd be a good host and take you around. But these are difficult times. Let's head to the Palace of Astrum first and report your arrival to Madam Yukong.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Palace of Astrum?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: Right there, the tallest building in the city. It's also the headquarters of the Sky-Faring Commission. Let's hurry. We haven't got much time.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: What's the hurry?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: We need to take a breather.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Can we talk about it first?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: *sigh* I don't mean to rush you, but if Madam Yukong holds me accountable for not getting you over soon enough, I wouldn't want to be around for the consequences...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Sounds scary. I thought you said she was kind-hearted?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: We need to make a few preparations before paying a visit to any of the six commissions. Rest assured, Miss Tingyun, we won't go anywhere. If you could inform Madam Yukong of our arrival first, we'll meet you at the palace entrance later.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Tingyun]: ...Very well.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Little miss fox moves at quite the pace — I can't keep up with her. *sigh* I've spent too long on the bench... Let's catch our breath for a while — we can expect a packed schedule ahead.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: That Tingyun is a sly one...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: That might be a little harsh, but she does put her own interests first.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: She did the right thing by not trusting us initially — we were an unknown quantity to her. As for the rush... my guess is she's just eager to get us out of her hair and further up the chain.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: That Yukong sounds like a tough lady...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: It'll be alright, we're not trying to stand in her way. We have nothing to hide from her.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: We didn't have anything to hide in Belobog, either...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Nice! Let's have a look around the city.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Not so fast...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: I need to give you two a heads up first. Our meeting with Madam Yukong won't be without risk. We need to be prepared and take it seriously.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: She is a top Xianzhou leader... Mr. Yang, do you think this could be Belobog all over again...?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Are you saying that... Madam Yukong is the new Madam Cocolia!?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Let me guess, they're gonna put us up in a hotel first...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: No, the Xianzhou Alliance is better than that. But Madam Yukong will definitely have a string of difficult questions for us...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Why did we choose to come to the Xianzhou now? How did we know that the incident is related to a Stellaron? Who leaked their information to us...?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Careless answers mean distrust and potential hostility, which would make things much harder for us.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Aw, crud. One of us is gonna blurt something out or get something wrong, I just know it...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: I feel offended.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: *sigh* See?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Mr. Yang should do the talking.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Good idea! We can be his cheerleaders in the background.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: ...Let's not do that.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Shouldn't we plan out what we want to say?
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: Ugh... But we haven't done anything wrong!
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: March is right. If we're too scripted, it'll sound like we're hiding something.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Narration]: Let's just be honest with her.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][March 7th]: What if she thinks we're with the Stellaron Hunters? Never mind the Alliance, even I don't trust them...
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: is right. If we're too scripted, it'll sound like we're hiding something.
[Amidst the Mara-Struck][Welt]: Don't worry. We'll find a way through. Let me do the talking.

[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: Sorry, this place has been sealed off. Please go another way around.
[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: This place is temporarily closed off. Please use another route.
[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: Hello, I've been assigned to guard the entrance here. You can take another route.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Listen
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Salary-Concerned Freight Handler: *sigh* The dock's been sealed off. Will we be getting our wages?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Livelihood-Concerned Freight Handler: No idea. I doubt it. The boss probably has no money to pay us, what with this fiasco...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Salary-Concerned Freight Handler: If this keeps up, how'll we survive then?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Livelihood-Concerned Freight Handler: Who knows... *sigh* I wonder when the restrictions will be lifted...
[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: Go no further. The area ahead is currently under inspection. The lockdown will be lifted when the safety is ensured.
[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: How about we explore the area ahea... I mean, the area ahead is currently under lockdown and inspection. This route is closed for the time being.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Anxious Woman
[Devising Stratagems][Anxious Woman]: Let me through now! I have to sell these goods on the double!
[Devising Stratagems][Serious but Polite Cloud Knights Soldier]: Please calm down. Which is more important: your life, or your deal? Consider this carefully.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Flustered Man
[Devising Stratagems][Flustered Man]: Please find it in your heart to let me through, I'm on urgent business. Please let me through...
[Devising Stratagems][Serious but Polite Cloud Knights Soldier]: That won't be possible. Please understand. You're not the only one in a rush. Everyone is. How can I make an exception for you?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Worried Man
[Devising Stratagems][Worried Man]: Please let me through. My daughter's waiting for me at home.
[Devising Stratagems][Serious but Polite Cloud Knights Soldier]: I'm sorry. Please understand, the road up ahead has been sealed off...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Listen
[Devising Stratagems][Emotional Man]: That Starwatcher Avenue would be so crowded even with a lockdown... Xianzhou is really a sight to behold.
[Devising Stratagems][Melancholic Woman]: It's a pity that we can only admire from afar.
[Devising Stratagems][Emotional Man]: It's all right, it will get better very soon. I'll treat you to a meal when the lockdown is lifted.
[Devising Stratagems][Melancholic Woman]: *sigh* I certainly hope so.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Inquire
[Devising Stratagems][Courteous Cloud Knights Soldier]: My apologies, please stay where you are. The situation is complicated, and we currently do not have a clear view of the situation. We have had no choice but to seal this area off.
[Devising Stratagems][Courteous Cloud Knights Soldier]: If you have business to attend to, please do it when the situation has settled down. Apologies for any trouble.
[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: I'm sorry, but this route is closed. We're conducting inspections in accordance with the Cloud Knights patrol ordinance.
[Devising Stratagems][Cloud Knights Patroller]: Halt. Under order of the general and to mitigate further risk, Starskiff Haven is under partial lockdown.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Oh, you're here already? Sorry to keep you waiting. Madam Yukong is expecting you.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Are you not coming?
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: I've brought Madam Helm Master up to speed. It's over to you now~
[Devising Stratagems][Navigation Officer]: Yes, Madam.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: Report the losses to General Jing Yuan and find someone from the Divination Commission. They can't just stand there watching while we deal with this mess...
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: Greetings, guests from the Astral Express.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: Tingyun has informed me of the purpose of your visit. Receiving guests isn't normally one of my responsibilities...
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: ...but since you know about the Stellaron and have stated that you want to help the Luofu, I thought I should at least meet you in person...
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: ...and politely decline your proposal.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Decline!?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Why!?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: The Xianzhou Alliance knows what a Stellaron is and is more than capable of handling it ourselves. We have been around for over 8000 years and weathered countless dangers and crises. While the situation is serious, we have more than enough resources to spare. Outsider help is not needed on this occasion.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: You are guests from afar — there is no reason for this matter to concern you... Am I making myself clear?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: From what we've gathered, the influence of the Stellaron can still be contained.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: If we can locate it in time and contain it, it's possible that we can restore any space — and any individuals — affected by the corrosion.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: We have experience in preventing Stellaron disasters, and we've only come here to lend you that experience.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: I've said this and I'll say it again: This is an internal affair of the Xianzhou Alliance and there is no need for the Astral Express to get involved. I decided to arrange a meeting with you as a gesture of respect, but my decision is final.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...But—
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Never mind, Mr. Yang. If the Xianzhou Alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. Let's go.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: I'm afraid that's impossible.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: ...Huh? And what's that supposed to mean?
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: It's only been a few days since the presence of a Stellaron was detected on the Luofu. Starskiff Haven has been under full lockdown — no one has been permitted to leave. How did you come to know of the incident, and what led you to conclude that it was linked to a Stellaron?
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: I acquired the access history of Starskiff Haven. Not long ago, someone hacked into the system and opened the Jade Gate, before guiding you, the Astral Express, into our territory.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: The hacker was skillful and even taunted us with her seal. Her name is Silver Wolf, a member of the Stellaron Hunters...
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: What say you in your defense?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The Stellaron Hunters told us to come here!
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The Stellaron Hunters want to use you to take us out!
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: You are forbidden from leaving the Sky-Faring Commission until the aforementioned questions have been investigated.
[Devising Stratagems][???]: Don't be too harsh, Yukong. If this gets out, the whole galaxy will think the Alliance has forgotten how to treat our guests.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: General Jing Yuan—
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: It's very unlikely that the Express has joined forces with the Stellaron Hunters. They are mortal enemies, after all.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Apologies for interrupting your meeting. My name is Jing Yuan — I'm the general of the Cloud Knights here on the Luofu.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: General, this is an internal affair for the Luofu...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I fully agree with you, Helm Master Yukong, this is indeed an internal affair.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I am sorry, guests of the Astral Express. It is true that there is a Stellaron on the Luofu, but I'm afraid I cannot accept your kind offer to help resolve the issue. This is a Xianzhou matter, and it is our responsibility to handle it.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: ...Of course, it would be inappropriate of me to let you return without something to show for it. While I cannot accept your help with regard to the Stellaron, I do have a favor to ask. Please, after you.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: The Astral Express! I must confess that the train's reputation precedes it, such that it is often close to my thoughts. How delightful to come face to face with its passengers!
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Frightfully delightful!
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Would that this occasion had come sooner!
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: ...Are you really a general?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: It's an honor to meet you, general. May I ask what the favor you spoke of is?
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Ah, a matter that requires capable people such as yourselves. We captured a member of the Stellaron Hunters a few days ago, who goes by the name of "Blade."
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: During our investigation, the Divination Commission — the department in charge of intelligence processing — intercepted a transmission sent out by his accomplice, Kafka, who has managed to hide aboard the ship. As for where that transmission was destined...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The Express.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Go on! Where!?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I have some knowledge of your relationship with the Stellaron Hunters. The Divination Commission is convinced that you made an alliance with them... I say that's impossible. The crew of the Astral Express are honorable people whose valiant deeds are lauded across the universe. There must have been a misunderstanding.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: As such, I came to the conclusion that the communication must have been an attempt by the Stellaron Hunters to sow dissent between us.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: That's right! We've been framed!
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Maybe the Stellaron Hunters have other motives...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: We can handle the Stellaron, but it will take time and will require the bulk of the Cloud Knights on the ship. It is this Kafka that concerns me. The longer she stays on the ship, the bigger the threat she will pose.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Since the Stellaron Hunters lured you to our ship, we shall move with the current. You are hereby authorized to do as you deem fit on the Luofu, with the goal of bringing Kafka out of the shadows and under our control.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Doing so would clear the misunderstanding between us, reveal the true intentions of the Stellaron Hunters, and help us understand their connection to the Stellaron burst. What say you, my Astral guests?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ..., what do you think?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Let's move with the current and help out.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: If you are able to capture this Stellaron Hunter, the Xianzhou will be indebted to you.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Our expedition was focused on the Stellaron...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I'm afraid my hands are tied on the matter — this is a diplomatic affair and I have rules to follow. But if you can bring me the Stellaron Hunter and discover her motive for placing a Stellaron on the ship, it would be of great help in resolving the incident.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: We don't really have a choice.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Of course you do. You can be strangers and simply walk away. But I feel you wish to help the Xianzhou.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: The Luofu never fails to reward that which is given.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...Okay.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Wonderful, it's a deal then. I shall notify Yukong that all intel is to be shared with you, and that our best personnel are to aid you in your search.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: If there's anything the Sky-Faring Commission or the Cloud Knights can do for you during your stay, don't hesitate to make it known.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The chat concluded, and Welt shot you a covert gesture. You understand that this is the Crew's own discussion time.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Jing Yuan's Hologram
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I have heard of you, ... The Alliance is very interested in the Astral Express.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: About Blade...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Blade is wanted by both the IPC and the Alliance. I'm afraid I cannot comment on his file.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: About Kafka...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: There are five known members of the Stellaron Hunters. Elio is their leader, but always stays behind the scenes. Most of the operations are led by Kafka.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Had the Divination Commission not intercepted her encrypted transmission, she would have remained undetected for much longer.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Once we catch the Stellaron Hunter...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Bring her to us.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Kafka is good at controlling the people around her.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Kafka won't say anything.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Hmm, ordinary means may prove futile when it comes to this individual. But the Divination Commission has ways of...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: ...Haha, don't misunderstand me. The Xianzhou does not engage in torture. Retrieving intel does not necessarily involve the use of violence.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: In any case, you can deliver her directly to us. Once we learn something, I will share every piece of information with you.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: I don't have any other questions.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: If things go as planned, I would love to find the time to sit with all of you and hear about your experiences among the stars. My responsibilities to the Xianzhou have meant that I haven't had the chance to travel in many years.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: We had heard nothing of the Express for a long time. It is heartening to learn of its continued journey along that starward track.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I have other matters to attend to. Goodbye for now.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: What do you make of this Jing Yuan?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: He's pretty handsome.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: I'm not asking about that! Although, you're not wrong...
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: He's much easier to talk to than that Yukong — their attitudes are so different! Maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Trustworthy.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: I feel the same. He's much easier to talk to than that Yukong — their attitudes are so different! Maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Suspicious.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: 
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: He's much easier to talk to than that Yukong — their attitudes are so different! Maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: We've got a Xianzhou general on our side! This time we have to... wait, does this seem familiar to you? Let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: Seeing as the general gave the order, the Sky-Faring Commission will lend you our full support. The Stellaron Hunter investigation is in your hands now. I'll issue you a pass so you can access the facilities around Starskiff Haven.
[Devising Stratagems][Yukong]: As for personnel... the skyports are currently all under maintenance, so we're thinly stretched. What I can do is send Tingyun as your guide — she'll take care of you during your stay.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Hmm, I think we only scratched the surface of this General Jing Yuan...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Do you think there's something strange about him?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: I don't know about "strange," but my gut tells me something is off.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: He seems suspicious...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Oh? Care to elaborate?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Why would he stop us from investigating the Stellaron?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: He says he doesn't want outsiders getting involved in the Xianzhou's internal affairs, which is understandable.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Why did he ask us to go after Kafka?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Yes! There's something about this point...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Why is he being so kind to us?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: He wants us to trust him. He took advantage of Yukong's frosty reception to play the good guy.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: I thought he was on our side?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Theoretically, yes. But something feels off.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Ah, that's it! A minor detail, but curious. He avoided talking about Blade!
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Since the Cloud Knights have already captured a Stellaron Hunter, why not use him to get to Kafka? Why rely on us?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: The Xianzhou is reluctant to involve outsiders in the Stellaron disaster, so why is it so keen on letting us capture a Stellaron Hunter?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Could Blade have escaped?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Do you think Jing Yuan lied about the Stellaron?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: He's using us as bait...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Yes. The only sensible conclusion I can draw is that Blade had already escaped when Jing Yuan spoke to us — provided they even captured him in the first place.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Therefore, given our connection to Kafka, we represent the only way of luring the Stellaron Hunters in.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: That's why he asked for our help... He didn't want to let anyone else find out that Blade had already escaped!
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Now that we've figured that out, perhaps we can get closer to the core of what's happening here.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: This Jing Yuan... how much does he know, and how much is he hiding from us?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Leave
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Master Diviner, you heard our discussion. What do you make of it?
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: What do I make of it? "The way of heaven is apparent, but the heart of humanity is often deceptive." Are you asking me to divine their true intentions?
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: That won't be necessary. The crew has nothing to do with the incident, of that I am almost certain. It isn't their intentions that trouble me. All I want is for them to lure out the one we're after.
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: Wasn't that my idea, general?
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Indeed, your counsel has always been of great help to me. You may use your discretion on the matters ahead of us.
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: Hmph, why don't you retire early and I use my discretion full-time?
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: It is still too soon, unfortunately. If something goes wrong, you'll need a general to take the blame. How could I simply walk away and put you at such risk?
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: If you'd brought me that Blade earlier, none of this would've been necessary.
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: Wait, what are you up to exactly? Jing Yuan, did you... let him escape on purpose!?
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Me? I had no idea he might escape! Unlike you, my gaze never travels beyond the horizon. I take full responsibility — the Cloud Knights failed in their duty.
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: Hmph, I can understand. There's a lot to take care of on the Xianzhou — you were bound to miss something. Thank goodness I'm here...
[Devising Stratagems][Fu Xuan]: On that note, perhaps it's about time you finally nominate me as your successor when the Six Charioteers next convene...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: Yes, yes, yes... I have to go now — I'll leave this in your overwhelmingly capable hands, Fu Xuan.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: *sigh* There are three things in the world that I can't seem to rid myself of: the troubles of the Xianzhou, the papers on my desk, and the weeds in my garden.
[Devising Stratagems][Yanqing]: General, Diviner Fu wants the general's position for herself. Everyone knows that.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: She is very capable, but her intellect is burdened by a quick temper. I'll retire when she's achieved a better balance.
[Devising Stratagems][Yanqing]: This Stellaron thing is easy. Blade escaped, now we gotta go get him. Just say the word and I'll solve this in a flash.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I can understand your impatience, and I know you want to prove yourself. Now is not the time. If you truly wish to become Sword Champion, you shouldn't be running around brandishing your sword at people, especially not a major criminal.
[Devising Stratagems][Yanqing]: Tsk, you think I'd lose to Blade?
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I'm saying you need to have patience, Yanqing. Governing Xianzhou is different from a sword fight. The only way to build momentum is to work slowly. Besides, we still don't know who's really moving the chess pieces...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: There is something we must take care of before making our next move. As long as it remains unresolved, we're at a stalemate. That something is the Stellaron.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: How did it manage to bypass the Sky-Faring Commission's inspections and the Divination Commission's predictions? Where is it now?
[Devising Stratagems][Yanqing]: I say we bring those two Stellaron Hunters before Diviner Fu — she'll get an answer out of them in no time.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I've asked our friends from the Express to take care of that for us. Worry not, you'll have your moment when the current stalemate is broken.
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: You are my most trusted aide, and there are some things that I would only assign to you. Speaking of which, Yanqing...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: *sigh* That boy...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: I suppose it is my fault. I should have given him an opportunity already. "A sharp sword can't stay sheathed forever," haha...
[Devising Stratagems][Jing Yuan]: My fear is that this might prove too big a setback, bigger than his exuberance...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: *sigh* Madam Yukong has asked me to look after you.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Seems like we were destined to be in each other's company...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: The Sky-Faring Commission has reserved rooms for you at the Petrichor Inn. When you finish your business here, how about some tea together?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Thank you so much...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Not at all, though I'd appreciate it if you mention to Madam Yukong that you got a warm reception from me when you next see her. *sigh* Better to be busy than idle, I suppose.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: You seem reluctant...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: No, no, though I'd appreciate it if you mention to Madam Yukong that you got a warm reception from me when you next see her. *sigh* Better to be busy than idle, I suppose.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: A hotel? Again?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Easy, I know this probably brings back bad memories.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Investigate
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Whoa... I felt like I suddenly lost weight when we passed through.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Same!
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: There was a gravitational shift. The same thing happens when we warp jump, only we feel heavier.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: So much for cutting calories...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Do you even have weight to lose?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: There was a gravitational shift. The same thing happens when we warp jump, only we feel heavier.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Y'know, you're talking my language. B—But I liked your explanation too, Mr. Yang, hehe...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: I think you're imagining things.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: There was a gravitational shift. The same thing happens when we warp jump, only we feel heavier.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? I thought all that working out was finally paying off...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: The Xianzhou possesses extremely advanced technology. If I'm not mistaken, we've been in an artificial ecosphere since we arrived at the skyport.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: The evidence is above us.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Strange clouds...
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: There's a huge star in the sky and you're only interested in the clouds?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The planets look way too close to each other.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Strange. I don't remember seeing a big planet near the Xianzhou when we were on the Express.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: You're right. Something with a mass as huge as a Xianzhou ship should keep clear of any planets on its course... otherwise, it risks being caught up in the gravitational pull.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: The sky here is an artificial boundary. I imagine it was created to shield residents from the pitch dark of outer space, and the negative emotions that it can generate... fascinating.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: I heard that residents of the Xianzhou have extremely long life spans, which would require them to make great efforts to preserve their mental health... meaning...
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: You sure know a lot, Mr. Yang.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: You sure zone out a lot, Mr.Yang [sic].
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Focus, Mr. Yang. We've got work to do...
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: When you travel with Mr. Yang, he'll give you a thesis on everything he sees — if you have the patience to let him go on and on.
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Right, okay, let's get back to work.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: *yawn* Well, here we are. I feel sleepy already.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The sun hasn't gone down yet.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: What? But we've done a whole day's work — what's the sun playing at? It felt like we spent the whole day in the Palace of Astrum.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Ready for a nap? That's not like you, March...
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Hey, that's not fair! My eyes are peeled this time — I'll make a run for it the second things go wrong.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Jokes aside, did you see Madam Yukong frown at us? I thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: *sigh* I'd rather deal with monsters than these big shots...
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Ah! I—I mean... not that Madam Yukong doesn't have her merits, hehe...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Don't worry, my lips are sealed~
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: But as her subordinate, I have to say that it's Madam Yukong's duty to keep her guard up. The Luofu is facing a crisis, and as head of the Sky-Faring Commission, she is responsible for the security of the Xianzhou's customs and borders.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: She's actually a very reasonable old girl in private.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Old girl?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Reasonable? Are we thinking of the same person?
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: They say that many years ago, Madam Yukong was an ace pilot in the Cloud Knights. She was a "work hard, play harder" type, known for her hot temper and incredible skill.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Eventually, she became the head of the entire commission, which required her to learn patience and adopt a meticulous approach to her work.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: In any case, Madam Yukong instructed me to reserve the best rooms at the inn and have all your expenses covered. She wants to extend the full courtesy of the Xianzhou so that all of you enjoy your stay to the fullest~
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: She specifically mentioned that if you wish to buy anything at the inn, be it food or otherwise, just let the innkeeper know. The commission will cover the cost.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Say thanks to Madam Yukong for us!
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Why don't you go back yourself?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: The commission will cover the cost!
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: That's the friendliest thing I've heard since we arrived!
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Ahem! S—Seeing as our hosts are so thoughtful, I guess we should help ourselves. Right, Mr. Yang?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: We should focus on our objective first. Seeing as Helm Master Yukong was extremely reluctant to get us involved, am I right to speculate that the Sky-Faring Commission has some leads on the whereabouts of Kafka?
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Exactly right. The suspect is extremely cunning. She encrypted her transmission and timed her communication — we couldn't pinpoint her exact location.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: But as cunning as she is, the Divination Commission has managed to find something.
[Devising Stratagems][Kafka]: Here are the coordinates. It's up to you how to proceed.
[Devising Stratagems][Kafka]: Our destinations may differ, but the orbits of the stars will eventually converge. See you later.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Is there anything special about what she said?
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Don't let her words distract you.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Coordinates? Converge?
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Don't let her words distract you.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: I heard something in the background.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Precisely.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: That's the sound of a device.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Ahhhh, which means... what exactly!? This is a starship! There are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Miss March, to the untrained ear, these noises may sound the same. But for the craftsmen of the Artisanship Commission, every machine has a different pitch and melody.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: The general sent for craftsmen, and they concluded that the sound came from the shipyard facilities in Stargazer Navalia.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Now, get some rest and prepare yourselves for the operation ahead. I look forward to seeing you in action~
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: How can I help?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: There's something I want to say.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Oh? Let's hear it.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Was it raining when Kafka's transmission was intercepted?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Kafka was holding an umbrella in her transmission...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: How perceptive. Our wind, clouds, rain, and fog are all artificial. The Realm-Keeping Commission's weather pavilion manages the environmental conditions here.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: If Kafka was holding an umbrella, that means she was in an area with artificial rainfall during the transmission.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Still, that doesn't help us much. The ship is huge, with changing conditions across various delves. I'm sure there were showers across many of them at the time.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Any chance Kafka is still at Stargazer Navalia?
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: Impossible to say. It used to be that the Divination Commission could track the access history of all the delves...
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: But with the arrival of the Stellaron, things have become messy. Some delves even had their entrance marked as the exit.
[Devising Stratagems][Tingyun]: If I were one of the Stellaron Hunters, I'd be very happy to capitalize on all the chaos. It'd be harder to escape, but easier to blend in.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Never mind...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Let's take advantage of the rest. It won't be easy to track down Kafka the Stellaron Hunter.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Oh, let's let the Express know how we're doing~
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: More importantly, let's see how Dan Heng's doing! Hee-hee, ask him what he's up to — then tell him we're having loads of fun!
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: MessagesDan HengHey, you guys doing alright? Message failed to sendMarch and I are doing missions for the Xianzhou...March and I are doing missions for the Xianzhou...Are you okay...?Are you okay...? Message failed to send
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Not long ago, on the Astral Express...
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: You've been standing here for half an hour. It's rare to see you like this.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: Are you worried about those two? Welt is with them. They should be fine.
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: Himeko, did you keep a copy of the Stellaron Hunters' transmission?
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: Can I have a look?
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: ...Sure.
[Devising Stratagems][Kafka]: Not to mention, 45 system hours ago... a Stellaron burst occurred on the Luofu.
[Devising Stratagems][Kafka]: An unexpected calamity... don't you think?
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: What exactly are you Stellaron Hunters trying to do...? The Xianzhou Alliance aren't us — they won't give you time to explain. Once you draw the attention of The Hunt, you become their prey. The Alliance will hunt you to the end of the universe...
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: Stop speaking in riddles, Kafka. Say what you have to say.
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: ...
[Devising Stratagems][Kafka]: ...It's simple. That Stellaron has nothing to do with us, but the Xianzhou is convinced that we're responsible.
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: Stop!
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: ...Do you know him?
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: The Xianzhou is in danger! ...This man, he—
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: If he's on the ship, then Welt, March, and ... everyone is in grave danger!
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: But...
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: Is he... connected to that past you want to escape?
[Devising Stratagems][Dan Heng]: I... I can't leave them down there. It's just... I'm afraid my burden has finally caught up with me, and that everyone is about to be drawn in...
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: Is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? She may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as March has hers.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: We tread on a Path that is hidden from us. The things we see and the trails we blaze all become our baggage. They weigh us down, but they also give us strength to continue the journey.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: Try not to dwell on it, Dan Heng.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: The Express spends seven standard days at each stop. Its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: Pom-Pom and I are more than capable of looking after the Express.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: If there's something you've got to do, do it now. Better than regretting it further down the line.
[Devising Stratagems][Himeko]: And... you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Message not sent? Why not?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: I don't know.
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Bad signal?
[Devising Stratagems][Narration]: Maybe they demolished the base stations?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: Long-range communication technology is still improving. Perhaps the presence of the Stellaron is affecting signal transmission.
[Devising Stratagems][March 7th]: Doesn't seem like it, everything else is working fine — see?
[Devising Stratagems][Welt]: In that case, it looks like someone wants to make things difficult for us. Since Kafka's here, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be that Stellaron Hunter hacker girl's handiwork.

[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Himeko
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Himeko]: If there's something you've got to do, do it now. Better than regretting it further down the line.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You want to disembark, Dan Heng? Changed your mind?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Yes.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Well then, Pom-Pom wishes you the best of luck.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: ...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Mm... Pom-Pom understands. Not everything needs to be put into words.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Best of luck.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Make sure you return before the Express departs...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...and bring Pom-Pom back some local specialties?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Something else you need?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: Can't send the message out...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: The network is down, but some functions still work?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: Virtually nothing has changed since I left...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: ...apart from darkness, this place is all that I remember of the Luofu.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Investigate
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: Shattered Cloud Knight armor...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: A conflict with the Cloud Knights? Hm... Not likely, Mr. Yang wouldn't let that happen...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][???]: Stay where you are — I can handle this.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][???]: Emergencies should be dealt with by professionals...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: ...You're hurt.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: It's okay! Phew, this one's strong alright!
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: What...?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: With you two risking your lives for me...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: Could I really...
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: "...stay where I am?"
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Are you two okay?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Good. I'm Sushang of the Cloud Knights — I was just transferred here from the Yaoqing!
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: I did tell you to let me handle it. I don't have eyes in the back of my head — what if I accidentally hit you?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Luocha]: Forgive me miss, but you were too busy being hit yourself. It's a good thing I joined the fray.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Ha, I was protecting you more like — it's a Cloud Knight's job to protect others. This area is under martial law, I'm escorting all civilians to safety. Follow me.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: That was some impressive Cloud Knight spearmanship. Which unit are you from?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Narration]: I'm not a Cloud Knight.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Huh, okay... You're a civilian then. Come with me!
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Luocha]: Miss Sushang, what exactly has transpired here? In all my trade visits, I've never seen Starskiff Haven in such a state.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: I, uh... I can't comment on that. I was just ordered to rescue the civilians... Actually, I have no idea either. Anyway, you two just need to come with me.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Hey, you're pretty quiet. What's your name? I've got forms to fill out — can't put your name down as blank.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Dan Heng]: My name is Dan Heng. I'm a traveler. I'm on my way to meet up with my friends. I appreciate the help, but I can leave the port on my own.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: No can do, mister — it's way too late. You won't find anyone at Starskiff Haven. If your friends made it out, then they'll already be in the safe zone. No need to worry, you'll see them when we get there.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Luocha]: Aren't you going to take my name too, miss?
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: You already said it when we were busy fighting. Luo... something... Luocha! Is that right? I remember it.
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Let's go! Stay close, you two. Cloud Knight Sushang will guarantee your safety!
[Scattered Memories of Hooded Past][Sushang]: Ah, one more thing — I need you to write your names down later. I don't know too many characters, I might make a mistake...

[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Listen
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Weird-Behaving Girl: Come to think of it, why would an infamous thief be hiding here and doing odd jobs? It doesn't make any sense.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Weird-Behaving Girl: ...I can't absolutely definitely one hundred percent confirm that.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Weird-Behaving Girl: But this person looks exactly like the face on that IPC Wanted poster...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Oh, you've arrived.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Sorry to keep you waiting.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: No, no, only an extra couple of hours~
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Seems like you're not particularly happy to see us.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Hee-hee, I like your sense of humor, benefactors. Of course I'm happy to see you! When things settle down, I might even get promoted for catching a Stellaron Hunter.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Stargazer Navalia is governed by the Artisanship Commission — it took me a while to sort out our paperwork. I got a sense of the situation on my way back.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Just like at Cloudford, Stargazer Navalia's meridian pin has malfunctioned. The checkpoint there is abandoned and the garrison is scrambling to locate the Stellaron.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: With monsters wreaking havoc and the Knights scattered, Stargazer Navalia has become a perfect place for the suspect to hide out.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: So... we've got a bunch of monsters to deal with, an IPC most-wanted Stellaron Hunter to catch, and we have to do all that on our own without reinforcements... Fair enough, this isn't our first rodeo.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: That's just what we do every day.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Haha, that's the trailblazing life for ya.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: You've caught a Stellaron Hunter before?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: I was just making small talk, never mind the details!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: I wouldn't say you're entirely on your own, hehe... When you're ready, let's get going~
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Shall we, my benefactors?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Let's go.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: One second.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Now, what's a hunt without a hound? Kafka is still at large, and the Sky-Faring Commission wants this problem to go away. I made a few calls and managed to procure this from the Artisanship Commission — perfect for hunting down suspects.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Awwww he's so CUTE!!!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Uh, Ahem, I mean... what can he do exactly? Are we gonna set him loose on Kafka?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Yes, and no. This is Diting, a bionic dog developed by the Artisanship Commission. He has all the five senses of the Foxian race and takes them to another level.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Be it tracks or scent, as long as he uncovers a trace, he'll follow it all the way to the end.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: All we need to do is look for any trace left by Kafka. It doesn't matter how good she is at hiding, Diting will find her.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: But before we get started, let's play with his settings a bit and get him ready~
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: To begin with, let's set him to scent detection mode~
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Tell Diting to follow the scent of my perfume and see what he can do!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: An ingenium dog crafted by the Artisanship Commission. Use its Locality Probe feature to find suspicious odors and traces.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: *sigh* We need to follow these sparkly traces to find Miss Tingyun, right?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: She's not in a hurry, that's for sure. Playing hide-and-seek with us while Kafka's still at large.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: The traces... where did they go? Is Diting malfunctioning?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Diting]: Woof!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Got it. He says the wind is too strong here at the port, so it's not easy to follow the scent.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: How do you know what he's saying?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: That's a lot of words for one bark, don't you think?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: That's just the psychic bond between cute girls and cute puppies!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Welt]: Using the environment to hide her traces... Our girl from the Sky-Faring Commission sure knows how to put up a challenge. Let's look around and see if we can find any other clues.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Or... we could ask around? Look how busy this place is, someone must have seen Miss Tingyun. That's not cheating, right? We're just collecting intel.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Diting]: Woof! Woof!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Forth
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Excuse me, any chance you saw a Foxian lady pass by?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: Well that's a heck of a question, miss! I'd say nearly one in every two people passing through Starskiff Haven is Foxian. We might have seen the lady you're looking for, but we wouldn't have batted an eyelid.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Back'n: He's not lying. Still, if you describe her a little, maybe it'll jog our memory.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: She's... Foxian?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: Write that down, write that down!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: She's... pretty.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: "Pretty?" That's too generic for a Foxian. Even if you don't count the ladies, there are plenty of gents that fit that description like a glove...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Back'n: As tedious as it is, I'm afraid you'll have to describe her in more detail. Please don't say "two ears, one tail."
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: ...I can put my hand on my heart and say I remember this fine lady.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Back'n: Nonsense. I've been stood next to you this whole time and I don't remember anyone like her.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: Well, I may not have seen her in person, but her beauty feels like a long-lost acquaintance... How wonderful to be reunited with her after so long!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Back'n: Oh dear. I'm sorry, my friend here appears to have lost touch with reality.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Are you two professional time-wasters or something?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: Please accept our apologies! Me and my partner do double act comedy in the Sleepless Earl — the teahouse round the corner. As you can probably guess, with all these curfews and lockdowns, we've hardly had an audience the past few days. We figured we'd find a spot on the street and do some rehearsal — just to stop us getting rusty.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Back'n: Then you guys swung by asking for this Foxian lady, so we thought we'd give you a bit of improv — free of charge I might add.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Forth]: Stay calm, stay calm! I did see the girl you're looking for. She took a turn from here into Starwatcher Avenue. I'd suggest you head over that way — she might still be there.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: I find it hard to trust anything you've just said...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Qingyue
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: Apologies, you've come at a bad time. Our shop is closing earlier than usual today...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Did you see a Foxian girl pass by here?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: A Foxian girl? Well, our bracelets and pendants are extremely popular among Foxian customers...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: ...and I'm sure this pretty young lady won't want to miss out on our Verdant Luna selection. Please, try anything you like...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: It couldn't hurt...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Hey, , remember what we're here for?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: We were just wondering if you could help us find somebody...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Sorry, we were just wondering if you could help us find somebody...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: *sigh* I knew it, nobody has time for jewelry in these trying times... A Foxian girl you say? Let me think...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: I did just see Miss Tingyun walk by. She's a big patron of ours...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Have you seen this lady?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: Well that's Miss Tingyun! She's a big patron of our shop.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: May I ask why you're looking for her? Surely she...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: We're her guests...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: I should've guessed from your attire — you look like you're from another world.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Qingyue]: Miss Tingyun sometimes takes intergalactic business delegates on tours around Starskiff Haven... In fact, I just saw her walk by, she was heading down the street.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan: Ah, new patrons I see! Looking for some refreshment at the teahouse?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan: Sadly there have been fewer and fewer bookings since the lockdown, so we decided just now to close the Sleepless Earl until further notice. We'll reopen once the Cloud Knights finish addressing their "security concerns."
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Did you see a Foxian girl pass by here?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan: Unfortunately yes, the boss is never far away.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Miss Tingyun... is your boss?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan: No, no, my apologies, different Foxian. If it's Miss Tingyun you're looking for, she was here a moment ago...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Any chance you've seen this lady?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan: Ah, so it's Miss Tingyun you're looking for...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Mr. Xiyan: She ordered a cup of Immortal's Delight and went on her way. I saw her checking out the food stalls over there, that might be a good place to start.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: *sigh* Here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Pawnbroker Handian
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Pawnbroker Handian]: Curious timing for a visit to Jeweler's Pagoda... Hm, your faces... no sadness or misery. I take it you're not here to pawn anything?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Did you see a Foxian girl pass by here?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Pawnbroker Handian]: Well, we're a pawn shop — we see plenty of customers. But let me see if I can recall the lady you're looking for...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Have you seen this lady?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Pawnbroker Handian]: Well, we're a pawn shop — we see plenty of customers. But let me see if I can recall the lady you're looking for...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Pawnbroker Handian]: I remember, she walked past my shopfront and headed over to the food stalls. I'd recommend asking over there.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Pawnbroker Handian]: Do come back when the Cloud Knights finish their business.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Salesby
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: Customers! Take your time, I've got plenty of good stuff here. Lots of nice gift ideas.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Did you see a Foxian girl pass by here?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: Yeah! Oh, wait, um... maybe not. Hmm, let me uh... search my memory for a moment...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Have you seen this lady?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: Yeah! Oh, wait, um... maybe not. Hmm, let me uh... search my memory for a moment...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: Ahem, if only business were better, perhaps my memory would start to improve... don't you think?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: You just want us to buy your things! This is extortion!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: I'll take it!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Before you leaving [sic] the Express, Himeko gave you 100 credits as pocket money. Maybe it's time to spend them.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: You swiped to open your phone with trembling hands. You barely know anything about the prices on the Xianzhou. Hope you can still afford it...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: ...Didn't see her.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Refund! Immediately!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: Hey, I didn't force you to buy anything, did I? I was simply commenting on my memory. And now I remember that I didn't see your Foxian lady... I mean, surely you don't want me to make up an answer and point you in the wrong direction?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Not gonna happen!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Not gonna happen!
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Grocery Store Owner]: Then you'll have to pardon my bad memory.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: , doesn't look like we're gonna get anything from him. Let's go search somewhere else.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Food Stall Owner
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Food Stall Owner]: More customers? You're a sight for sore eyes these days. So, what do you have in mind? I'd recommend our prawn crackers.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Someone was here before us?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Food Stall Owner]: A Foxian lady. She ordered a songlotus cake and went on her way.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Have you seen this lady?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Food Stall Owner]: So you know each other! She ordered a tuskpir wrap and went on her way.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: What else is on the menu?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Food Stall Owner]: Berrypheasant skewers, tuskpir wraps, steamed puffergoat milk... Oh, a Foxian lady just ordered a songlotus cake — they're great too.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Hey , we're not on a food tour, remember?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Do you know where the Foxian lady might be now?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Food Stall Owner]: She was just here, give me a second... Oh, she was heading towards Stargazer Navalia — that's my guess.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: Miss Tingyun must have left us these clues, right?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Welt]: Diting should be able to pick up her traces now.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: You found me~ Diting's quite handy when it comes to tracking, isn't he?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: If you pick up traces of Kafka in Stargazer Navalia, just switch him on. Don't let her escape.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: Stargazer Navalia
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Who'd have thought that Stargazer Navalia might become so quiet. "Long were the nights, when the clangor of hammers rose to meet the stars." ...People used to write poems about the shipwrights here.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: The Luofu relies on the starskiffs produced here to transport people and goods. Now that work in the shipyard has stopped, our internal transport and outbound flights might also grind to a halt.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: *yawn* Of course, the silver lining is I don't have to go on as many trips anymore.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: You don't seem to worry too much about the Xianzhou, Miss Tingyun.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: I wouldn't say that — a good businesswoman doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve. Besides, the alliance has weathered plenty of challenges. We can handle this situation.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Just to warn you, if we do run into Kafka, you'll have to do the fighting, benefactors. I'd love to help, but there's very little I can do except cheer you on from the side lines~
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: You want to leave all the fun to us?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Not a lot of people out there could've fought the mara-struck like you did. I'm only a civil servant — I can't imagine what Kafka would do to me if I were caught in the fray...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: We Foxians don't live as long as the Xianzhou locals, but I still want to enjoy the hundred-odd years I've got left. You'd do the same in my shoes, wouldn't you?
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Narration]: But Madam Yukong ordered you to...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: *sigh* Playing the Madam Yukong card, are we? That's not very heroic now, is it.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: Besides, the Madam Helm Master simply asked me to assist you in navigating around Starskiff Haven. It's no different to any other diplomatic mission or delegate reception.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Tingyun]: I was never much of a fighter, and I'm not one for risking my life either. Getting Diting into your hands is already beyond the realm of my job description.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][March 7th]: I'll definitely be putting in a few words next time we meet Yukong...
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Welt]: Understood. We won't put you out of your comfort zone, Miss Tingyun.
[The Hound Chases the Fox][Welt]: When we run into Kafka, we'll do the fighting — and the capturing for that matter. Thank you for showing us the way.

[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Before Diting can start tracking, you'll have to feed him some leads.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: If Kafka is hiding in Stargazer Navalia, she'll have left behind traces. Let's spread out and look for them — leave no stone unturned.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Shards of a Cloud Knight's weapon. Something really sharp caused this...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: It must have been Kafka! She's got a scary sword.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Look, Diting found a strange chest... and there's a hand print on it...!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Let me see... Slender fingers, but strong. This hand belongs to a killer.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Huh? There's a note here too. "Take your fancy? There's a reward inside~"
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Ugh, why do I get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: It seems like Kafka predicted our every move... Stay alert, all of you. We could be walking into a trap.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: "Immortal's... Delight"?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: "Immortal's Delight"!?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: This isn't a clue, it's just a brand of tea I like... Two cups a day keeps the tiredness at bay.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: I could do with a cup once we're done here...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Haha, milk tea twins!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: What's this? It looks like clay.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Mr. Yang, any idea?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: I think it might be shipbuilding material leftover from the assembly line, though I can't tell exactly what the substance is... I don't think it's connected to Kafka.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Is this... anything to do with Kafka?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: That's a shipwright's soldering gun, I think one of the workers here must have left it behind.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: "Downy cloud and opalescent moon are set in twain by the seals multitudinous. Neither road nor skiff shall cross the gulf and carry me to thee."
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Thanks to the synesthesia beacon I can understand the characters, but I don't get what any of it means... Is this something Kafka left behind?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Seems like a love poem to me.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: L—Love poem? Quick, put it back!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Ah, I know what this is! It's an advertisement for a Home-Use Object Finder.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: There are IPC advertisements everywhere. It's about time I got in touch with their trade commissioner.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Where are you going, benefactors?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Our priority now is to find anything that could lead us to Kafka.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Diting]: Woof! Woof!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Diting smells something...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: What's this...?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: ...A jade seal used by the shipwrights. It opens various passages.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: It looks like someone used it and then destroyed it — possibly Kafka.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: ...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Diting]: Woof! Woof!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: I know, I know, let's go and have a look!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Agh! Is that a grenade? What's that on the side... Huh? It's lipstick...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: "A small something for the lost..."
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Ugh, she's clearly taunting us!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: We should have enough clues here to get Diting on the move.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: No time to lose! Let's give him the scent and let him lead the way.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: I think we've rounded up all our suspicious clues... but did Kafka leave them behind on accident or on purpose?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: She sure did put a lot of work into this gag, and I think we're the punchline.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Ugh. Making us run around like jerks. I bet she's loving this! I can almost hear her whispering: "Come and get me..."
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: That would be suitably Kafkaesque...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: She sure is a Stellaron Hunter...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Ugh, why don't you go and marry her, huh?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Don't forget, she's on the IPC's most-wanted list — a fugitive that nobody can seem to pin down... and now we've become her prey while she stalks us in the shadows.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Let's go, benefactors, time is of the essence. We must be close.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Another chest, another hand print. Has this woman got nothing better to do?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: "A little cheese for the rats in the maze~"
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Rats!? She's playing games with us — I hate her!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: The scent... where did it go?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: When the trace of the hunted disappears, the hunter better think twice...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: It might mean the tables have turned.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Kafka!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: These Cloud Knights aren't mara-struck... What did you do to them?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: Just a little persuasion to get them to listen to me. But you know all about that already, don't you ?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: What a hassle, this place is too far for the diviner. See you up ahead.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Quick! Don't let her escape!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: March, not so fast!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: So close and yet so far... you'll have to pick up the pace.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Ugh, there's no way through here, we need to think of a way to cut her off!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Don't worry about locked doors, benefactors, we can use the conveyor belts.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: Welcome, Astral Expressers. Looks like you caught me.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: You're finished, surrender!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: You have the right to remain silent...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: This was all part of your plan.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: ...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Admit it, Kafka. You planned for us to come here.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: I didn't plan anything. It was the future. We interfere on countless future possibilities and make the best future a reality.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: You speak too highly of us, Welt. The Stellaron Hunters are merely destiny's slaves.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Best future? Best for who? As if you'd consider anyone but yourself.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: If I said "best for the universe," would you believe me? Hehe... Best for me, naturally.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Surrender, and save your explanations for the Xianzhou.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: If you want a fight, quit stalling!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: I have a lot to ask you...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: We're taking you to see the general of the Luofu. You can profess your innocence all you like, but the general will decide your fate.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: Oh thanks, but no thanks. I can't stand moving at someone else's pace.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: We don't have much time. If I were you, I'd make a move before it's too late.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Kafka]: Finally.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Rudimentary.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Your every move...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: ...has been foreseen...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: ...by the omniscia.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Fu Xuan, Divination Commission.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: I'll be taking the criminal from here.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Greetings, crew of the Astral Express. This is our first encounter... though given that I have encountered you in foresight, perhaps I should say the second. I am Fu Xuan, master diviner at the Divination Commission and one of the Six Charioteers.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Far-flung friends ought to be received with fine wine, but alas, the heavens, earth, and body are not aligned for such an occasion. You'll allow for a postponement of the usual formalities, I trust? We should begin with the matter at hand.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: ...What the actual heck is she saying?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: She's just showing off with some big and fancy words.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Even my Synesthesia Beacon can't make sense of what she said.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Ahem! If the method of my speech is offensive to you, you need but say.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: We received an assignment from General Jing Yuan to arrest the Stellaron Hunter. Thank you, diviner, for coming to our aid, but we must escort the fugitive to the general.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Inessential. I hold a proclamation from the general here, if you care to see. Upon detaining the Stellaron Hunter, questioning and all further arrangements are to be undertaken by the Divination Commission.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Did the general just spare us a walk with Kafka? I knew he was a good guy~
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Understood. However, the general promised that all intel would be shared with us. We have a right to know anything that Kafka divulges.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: ...Oh?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: That guy... Can I go one day without him throwing me under the—
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: We won't make things anymore complicated than they need to be. We just want to listen in on the questioning.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Very well, urgency demands fluidity... The three of you shall accompany me to the Divination Commission.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Can't we do the questioning here? The Stellaron Hunters are slippery, what if she makes a break for it?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Here would be better.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: We shouldn't delay.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Are you guys up to this?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: While I am here, she will not escape. Only the Divination Commission has the methods to make her talk and bring the truth to light.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: The time has arrived. We must depart. Please, proceed.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Let's disembark here, benefactors.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: ...I may live in relative seclusion, but I can recognize my own territory.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Why did you bring us here!? Does this look like the Divination Commission to you!?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: ...No need to yell, Master Diviner! The Meridian Pin is malfunctioning and I couldn't find the entrance to the delve. I wanted to get us straight to our destination but this is the only place I could dock the starskiff.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Look — "Exalting Sanctum" — this is a safe place. Let's just walk the rest of the way from here.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Hmph.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Our hexagrammatic position is fluctuating between the marsh and water trigrams. The vessel is stranded and the way is blocked...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: I heard the Xianzhou can tell your fortune — is that how they do it? Anyone can count on their fingers...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: The connoisseur appreciates the artistry, and the layman enjoys the show.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Yeah, yeah, yeah — so I'm a layman. Why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: This must be the "quantum entanglement" you hear about in stories.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: That's been out of fashion for hundreds of Amber Eras!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: You count on your fingers?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: What's wrong with that? We've got ten fingers, may as well use them!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: I just performed some quick divination and the hexagram is consistent with our current predicament. The starskiff cannot take us to the Divination Commission today. Alas, without me in charge to handle the Stellaron crisis, I dare not even imagine the kind of mess the commission must be in.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: It's true — the Divination Commission really can't go a single day without Lady Fu.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: That's why you have to develop your talent pool — otherwise everything falls apart when you go on vacation...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: Hmph, since you are clearly ignorant of the commission's internal affairs, I shall absolve you of your ridiculous remarks. I'm going ahead to make some inquiries. Goodbye.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Wait, we can help.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: You... really are enthusiastic. No wonder Jing Yuan told me to give you errands...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: What about Kafka?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: The prisoner must follow me every step of the way. This is Jing Yuan's order.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: We shall meet again!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: ...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. We have to be present when you question Kafka.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: You think too little of me — my word is my bond! I will stick to my promise even if this delve collapses. That's... very unlikely, by the way.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: To have this prisoner speak, the commission must resort to unconventional means... the nature of which is confidential and cannot be disclosed — forgive me. But I can assure you that the questioning will not begin until you arrive, even if that means wasting precious time.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Fu Xuan]: I have appointed someone to wait for you in front of Exalting Sanctum Plaza. Once we've consolidated our internal affairs, you will be brought into the Divination Commission. Please be patient.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: O—Okay, we trust you~!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: ...I think I offended someone again.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: She's just annoyed that you won't trust her.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Hey, are you on her side? I just wanted to remind her not to break her promise, that's all.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Well, someone had to put her in her place.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Hmph, you do it next time — I'm tired of being the villain.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: You think?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Don't start!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Don't take it to heart, March. Miss Fu Xuan seems like a reasonable lady — I'm sure she's not angry with you.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Really? I thought she was pretty icy...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Some people are not what they seem.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Hmm... I don't know how to deal with people like that.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: I'm sure she's just putting on a tough front.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: As icy as Dan Heng?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Haha, Dan Heng's not icy. He's nerdy.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Okay, enough chit-chat. I reckon the Divination Commission could be a while — let's take a look around.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Yeah! That starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in Exalting Sanctum.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Hey, fancy seeing you here.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: What does the Divination Commission do?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: *sigh* You never asked what the Sky-Faring Commission does. I suppose not all commissions are created equal...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Anyway, if you must know, the Divination Commission is responsible for gathering intelligence, devising strategies, and performing divination.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Divination? Trial by fortune-telling?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Maybe there's more to it? It's not like I would know, I'm a mere amicassador.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Don't worry, Diviner Fu seems confident about getting Kafka to talk. If I were you I'd just sit back and watch her do her thing.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Divination? Isn't that the same as flipping a coin?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Oh no, Xianzhou divination is nothing like the superstitious scams you see elsewhere. It's based on a technology called the jade abacus.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: From navigation to governance, military issues to civil affairs, every decision on the Xianzhou must be reviewed by the Divination Commission to ensure that it can be executed without a hiccup.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Will Fu Xuan go back on her word?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Who knows? She tends to make decisions based on the results of her divinations as opposed to what others might be thinking.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: If she doesn't want to reveal the commission's secrets, then you have no choice but to wait.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: How come Kafka gets to know their secrets?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: But it's okay for a wanted fugitive to find out...?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: The general entrusted the master diviner with the interrogation of the fugitive because he has faith in her ability to manage the situation. As one of the Six Charioteers, she is certainly capable.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Why do you think Kafka surrendered at the mere sight of her back in Stargazer Navalia?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Miss Tingyun, are you familiar with this place?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: Oh? Did you want a tour of Exalting Sanctum? Hee-hee...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: The last time I came here on a Starskiff was... let me think... about 20 years ago now. I've been on the road for so long that I've started to forget the sights and sounds of the Xianzhou...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: All I remember is that this is a good place to while away the days~ Still, many delves have changed beyond recognition since the arrival of the Stellaron.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Just taking a stroll...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: If you're bored, you could go and find the messenger from the Divination Commission.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Tingyun]: If you're bored, you could go and find the messenger from the Divination Commission.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: "...the nature of which is confidential and cannot be disclosed..." Is that a Xianzhou motto or something? First the Sky-Faring Commission, now the Divination Commission — they're all so secretive! The general's the only friendly face here.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: I hate to admit it, but I'm even starting to miss Sampo... Hold up! I must be losing my mind. Nope — I'll take the Xianzhou over that blue-haired bore any day...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: *sigh* We've gone from being chased through every street in Belobog, to waiting on every corner in the Xianzhou.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Chasing and waiting — maybe that's what life's all about...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Wow, when did you become a poet?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Hmph, I'm not just a pretty face, y'know! I've got poetry on standby 24/7.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Does the Xianzhou scenery seem familiar to you?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: ...Are you wondering if the Xianzhou is my homeworld?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: No, I'm not getting any flashbacks. Please — do I look Xianzhouish to you? You must be thinking of Dan Heng.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Come on! Let's go take a stroll and clear your head.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Good idea, let's go!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Wait a minute — clear my head of what!?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Should we wait here, or go find the messenger from the Divination Commission?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: When we confronted Kafka, she seemed certain that Fu Xuan would show up...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: She read the "script" in advance.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: It's like someone told her it would happen.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Like a fated encounter.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: That's a romantic way of putting it, but I suspect the reality could be more sinister...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: The leader of the Stellaron Hunters is called Elio. No one knows who he is or what he looks like — only that the Interastral Peace Corporation calls him "Destiny's Slave."
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: It's said that he has the power to foresee "possibilities." According to Herta, the corporation believes Elio can see the temporal branching of infinite possibilities — which is very much like being able to predict the future...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: ...in fact, it may even be superior. If the rumors are true, every seemingly meaningless action taken by the Stellaron Hunters may actually be a choice based on those "possibilities."
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: ...which would include what they did to you, ...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: I'm different. I have free will.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: I think that may be why the Stellaron Hunters won't leave you alone.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Be careful, . Every time a Stellaron Hunter appears, their objective may be to steer the direction of the future.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Is that all I am — a future variable?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: For the sake of this discussion? Yes, I think so. But, ... who isn't?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: All of us are future variables, our choices solidifying reality. The future is nothing incredible either — just a fog waiting for us to make a decision.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Whatever, I only care about the present.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: That's good, , but be careful — maybe the Stellaron Hunters showing up is a sign that they're trying to change the future...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Back to the matter at hand — Kafka...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Her surrender seemed odd...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: She didn't resist at all...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: It was all within her expectations.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Yes. It's strange for a fugitive to give themselves up, but a fugitive who can see the future? For her, perhaps that was the way it was always going to be...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: ...but is she really as calm as she seems? The future holds almost infinite possibilities, after all. I suspect she has proof that she has nothing to do with the Stellaron crisis.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Or perhaps something is supposed to transpire during the Divination Commission's interrogation — something that would allow her a window of escape...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: *sigh* Why did the Stellaron Hunters go to such lengths to bring us here? What is the future that Destiny's Slave sees behind this course of action?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Welt is deep in thought...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: Sorry, I'm getting a little fixated. If you want to head out, we should go this way.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: That's the plaza...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: ...but I can't see anyone waiting for us. Should we look around?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Everybody stay back!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Give him this medicine and make him lie down!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I—I mean...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: ...make "them" lie down...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: ...That'll teach you a lesson. Ready to lie down now?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Thanks for helping to stabilize the patients — your "assertive sedation" techniques are quite effective.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: "Assertive sedation techniques..." Does she mean beating people up?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: However, these Cloud Knights were already sick, and now they're injured too. I've gotta bandage up their wounds, realign their bones... Ugh, as if I didn't have enough on my plate!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Aren't you a little young to be realigning bones?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: I'm gonna need to see some qualifications...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Where did you come from little one? Is your Dad around?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I don't have a dad.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Uh — what about your mom?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I don't have a mom either.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: ...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I get it — you think because I'm small I must be a runaway child.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Hmph, welcome to the Xianzhou my short-lived outsider friends — appearances can be deceiving here! The Vidyadhara race is self-reincarnating — no mum or dad required!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I've been studying the art of healing ever since I cast off my old shell! You're looking at a recognized, practicing, dedicated doctor.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Things haven't been very peaceful on the Luofu recently. Make sure you don't—
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Go running around, right? Well, your general gave us an errand, so I'm afraid we have to.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Hm, well, seeing as you saved me just now, if you're unlucky enough to acquire any breaks or sprains... I'll treat you for free! As for medicine, I'll give you a twenty percent discount.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: That doesn't sound very "free."
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: So you're still charging us!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Ha, do you have any idea how many people on the Luofu are waiting for an appointment with me? You should count this as a blessing!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: If I hadn't left my purse at home, I wouldn't have to...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: Ahem, enough of that. I have patients to see.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: Our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around — don't you think Mr. Yang?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Welt]: So this is the Vidyadhara, I've only ever read about them. They're known as the dragon race... not hard to see why.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I need to focus on healing
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Bailu]: I can't be distracted
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Exalting Sanctum Resident]: That was terrifying, thank goodness the Vidyadhara dragon lady was saved...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Exalting Sanctum Resident]: Yes, that child's usually hidden away. What's she doing out here?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Exalting Sanctum Resident]: I heard the Knights affected by the evil are going berserk!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Exalting Sanctum Resident]: Don't scare yourself — the Alchemy Commission's dragon lady can cure anything.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Yuluo]: I... I tried my best
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jingyan]: Don't be ridiculous!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Yuluo]: That's... the best I can do...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jingyan]: Tsk, what's that supposed to mean? Doctors don't give up that easily!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Yuluo]: What else am I supposed to do? The route back to the Alchemy Commission has disappeared, and we're in the field without the right medicine or supplies.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Yuluo]: Besides, we have no record of this disease at all. These symptoms are consistent with someone about to be stricken with mara.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jingyan]: According to his medical record, this man is barely over 200 years old — he only just joined the Cloud Knights. How can he possibly be mara-struck? Why don't you... take another look.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jingyan]: If it goes on like this, the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission will have to come out and clean up this mess.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Yuluo]: My first time seeing these symptoms up close... Being stricken with mara is more terrible than I imagined.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jingyan]: I heard the Vidyadhara dragon lady is here. Maybe she can help stem the tide...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jinwen]: The delve is closed off
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jinwen]: Everyone we can mobilize is here
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jinwen]: Hurry, find beds for the patients from the other delves and stabilize them.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jinwen]: Remember to minimize contact — we don't want your people to succumb to the same evil...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Realm-Keeping Commission is out in full strength — what about the Alchemy Commission? Why are there so few of you here?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Jinwen]: Do you mean "out in full force"?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: Hey, missy, does this look like a classroom to you? Concentrate on treating the patients!
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: The route is temporarily closed
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: We will be distributing supplies to everyone
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Everyone, please remain calm. This is an announcement from the Realm-Keeping Commission General Bureau. Exalting Sanctum is temporarily closing its borders and navigation routes. The details will be outlined in the official bulletin sent to your jade abacus soon.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: If you feel unwell, please report to the Realm-Keeping Commission as soon as possible. We have doctors from the Alchemy Commission here who will see you free of charge.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Oh, we will also be distributing a bag of protein rice and emergency medicine to each of you. You can collect the supplies from me in person, or the commission can deliver them to your door.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Hello, I'm here to collect supplies.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Please register with your jade abacus bracelet... Oh, you must be an outsider.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: I see. Please, sign here.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Hello, how's the Divination Commission faring?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: I heard there's a problem with the meridian pin.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Some diviners and stargazers managed to escape the delve. Many of them were terrified — they were muttering about "plants" and "roots..." Something terrible must have happened there.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Do you have friends trapped in the delve? If you're worried about them, find a diviner and see if they can tell you what happened.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Thanks for everything you're doing.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: I want to say it's all in a day's work, but I've been here for twelve hours already... When will this end?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: This is an announcement from the Realm-Keeping Commission General Bureau. Exalting Sanctum is temporarily closing its borders...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Can I help you with anything?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Hello, I'm here to collect supplies.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Please register with your...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Wait a minute, I already issued you with supplies... You won't fool the Realm-Keeping Commission that easily.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Thanks for everything you're doing.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: All in a day's work, although I've been standing here for twelve hours now... I just want this to be over.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: Huh, now I'm getting déjà vu...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Songyan]: ...I think I need to take a break.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Tsk, when it rains, it pours. The Artisanship Commission has its own issues — sounds serious too! Go and inform the Cloud Knights — see if you can...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Oh, my apologies. I'm an orderly from the Realm-Keeping Commission. Judging by your dress, you must be visitors to the Luofu?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Yes.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Sorry, the Xianzhou is currently caught in... unusual circumstances. But the Cloud Knights will resolve the issues as soon as possible.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: For safety reasons, please stay in your residence and refrain from going out for the time being.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: I'm a guest — the general invited me.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: And I'm a civil servant — the general hired me.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Technically speaking, every traveler aboard the Luofu is a guest of the general.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: If the port is still open, I would suggest you take a boat to Starskiff Haven right away, though I heard the route may have been temporarily suspended...
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Oh, that reminds me... I have a friend with a starskiff and a travel permit — he could help you and your friends get over quickly. The price is fair and negotiable. What do you think?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: No need, I have a vessel picking me up.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Well now, you must be quite special! Don't spread this around, but this isn't some small-scale maintenance drill. The general has sent the Cloud Knights to check for hidden dangers.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: You may not need it right now, but if there's any help I can give you, come to me any time.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: No, thanks.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Hmph, very well. I still have business to attend to. If you change your mind, come to me any time.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Guangda]: Ugh, they pay us next to nothing then order us straight to the front line when things go south... I must be crazy.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: Excuse me,  — hold on a moment.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: It was only thanks to your help earlier that the dragon lady and those Exalting Sanctum residents got away unscathed.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Dragon lady?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: The dragon lady of the Alchemy Commission — Lady Bailu.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][March 7th]: You mean the child? She's starting to sound like a big shot.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Narration]: Our help?
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: You don't remember? You dealt with those mara-struck knights in the nick of time — I saw it all.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: A friend in the Sky-Faring Commission told me the general commissioned guests to deal with the troubles on the Luofu. You must be the guests.
[Stars Spun, Prescience Sprung][Dahao]: If you don't mind, I hope you can take the time to come to the Realm-Keeping Commission. I'd like to talk to you about the issues Exalting Sanctum is currently facing.

[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: What does that mean? It's just a picture. Are we supposed to meet someone there?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: It's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie...
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Welt]: That's enough of that. Come on, let's go.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Player in the South Seat]: Hurry up, Qingque! We'll be fossils by the time you're finished.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Player in the West Seat]: I heard there was a disaster in the Divination Commission's delve? I'm surprised you're in the mood to play right now, Qingque.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Even if the sky was gonna collapse on the Divination Commission, the master diviner would be there to hold it up. What she lacks in height, she more than makes up for in stamina.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Anyway, I didn't come here just to play — she ordered me to wait here for our guests. Time is precious! I'm simply multitasking.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: It's the place in the photo alright. Is this... a games parlor!? What kind of problem can they possibly be facing?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Ha! Isn't this hand a problem? I have the worst luck...
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Hi there! I can tell just by looking at you that you're the Divination Commission's guests.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Narration]: Did you bring us here just for this?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Narration]: Do you even know how long we've been waiting!?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Narration]: You don't want the master diviner to know you've been slacking off, do you?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: I know, I know, I'm sorry — I was going to wait for you by the statue, but— Ah— Triplet!
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: ...but folks from the Realm-Keeping Commission descended on the area. It's too loud over there now... Pass! Pass!
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: ...So I thought to myself, wouldn't it be better to meet somewhere quieter? FOUR OF A KIND!
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: ...And wouldn't that be more fun, too? Better to show you the real Exalting Sanctum and introduce you to a true Xianzhou pastime: celestial jade. Aha...
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Victory!
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: *sigh* Now that my wish has been fulfilled, there's nothing holding us back. Follow me, honored guests.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: I must apologize for your long wait, honored guests.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Welt]: It wasn't too long. Seeing your enthusiasm for this "celestial jade" game has stoked my curiosity.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Haha, I'm glad to hear it — you clearly have excellent taste! If you're interested I can show you how to play — it's great fun.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Welt]: Sure!
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: Mr. Yang! Is this really the best time?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: , look! Is that a...?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Tingyun]: It's an ancient tree — we call it the Ambrosial Arbor. It was once the Xianzhou Luofu's prized treasure.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: I didn't know the Sky-Faring Commission were history buffs! Not bad, younger generations usually don't know much about it. It's said that the Ambrosial Arbor is an ancient remnant from when the Xianzhou roamed the ether.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: From a distance it looks like half a tree stump, but according to Records of the Early Nation, in its prime, "it wound into the heavens, and from it celestial bodies hung!"
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: Meaning...?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Welt]: It means the tree was as tall as the sky and stars hung from its branches.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: So how big was it? Bigger than the Express? Bigger than Herta space station? No, that can't be right.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][March 7th]: "Stars hung from its branches..." Then how did it fit in the Xianzhou!?
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Narration]: Technically, any tree in the spaceship fits this description.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Those are metaphors! You shouldn't take poetry so literally.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Narration]: It sounds like an unimaginably magnificent tree.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Exactly, let's just say it was bigger than your imagination.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Anyway, it's just a legend. I see this view every day on my way to work — I'm kinda bored of it.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: Let's go.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Qingque]: We're almost there everyone, stay close.
[New Friends Bring New Joy][Narration]: Divination Commission

[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Just a heads up — please don't go running off once we're inside.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: You may be the master diviner's guests, but she hates people who don't abide by rules and regulations, oh — and people who ask too many questions, not to mention... *sigh* Please don't push her buttons.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: We're just here for the questioning. We'll leave as soon as it's over.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: ...So strange.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Let me guess, the gate isn't working?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: I don't understand, it's never been locked before... And no one told me to take a key.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Hey! I know the food here sucks but that's no reason to shut the gate on our guests!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Are you really from the Divination Commission?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Is it possible you were... fired?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: No way — she's already demoted me to managing the repository. What else does she want from me?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Maybe something happened inside?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Don't scare me! Master diviner wouldn't let anything bad happen on her watch.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: There's no need to panic, okay? This isn't the only entrance into the Divination Commission. I know an emergency access.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Here it is.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: You seem familiar — is this where you come to avoid doing work?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: You're pretty sharp. Divination Commission staff call this the "loafing gate."
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: When there's nothing to do, we often sneak out from here and spend a few hours lazing around outside.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: ...A few hours? *sigh* Do you have any vacancies?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Ugh, this Stellaron corrosion... what's going on?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Great, this gate won't open either. We've kept the master diviner waiting — no doubt she'll blame "unreliable Qingque" for messing up once again...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: I knew I'd offended that diviner — that's why she sent this girl to help us!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: Miss Qingque, if you don't mind, may I take a look?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Huh? Oh, uh... no need. Actually I was just being polite, I don't see why not.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Let me show you — this thing is pretty fun.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Wow, you're amazing Mr. Yang! You handled that well for an outsider. I officially hand over the title of "keeper of the loafing gate" to you!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: *sigh* Anyone here surprised? Anyone?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: Here comes trouble.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Ugh, can't we run around to them for a change!?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: I'm sorry, the Cloud Knights have orders from the master diviner to secure the commission's safety. The area up ahead is temporarily closed.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Mingyue]: Wow, a rare honor.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: ...Me? Have we met?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Mingyue]: No, I meant Qingque. I didn't expect to see her here during work hours.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: That's unfair — I'm working hard! Look, these are the guests the master diviner wants to meet.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Mingyue]: A rare honor.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Are you talking about us this time?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Mingyue]: Yes! The master diviner rarely allows outsiders — she likes her peace and quiet.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Mingyue]: If you want to see the master diviner, head straight to the Matrix of Prescience.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Mingyue]: They're short of hands — the master diviner is run off her feet and the Cloud Knights stationed there are driving away evil spirits. I don't know when they'll be done.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: This is the Matrix of Prescience — a large-scale jade abacus calculation terminal. It's the pride and joy of the Divination Commission.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: We've heard the term "jade abacus" a few times now. Would you mind explaining what it is, Miss Qingque?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: A jade abacus is just... a jade abacus!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Eh-he, that's a good question, Mr. Yang — it might take me a minute to give you an answer. Let me think...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: The book Glimpses Into the Beyond describes it as "living jade engraved with symbols for divination into the unknown."
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Just like engraving a seal, the craftsmen of the Xianzhou Artisanship Commission carve faint symbols into pieces of jade, and then insert them into machines to get them to operate according to a certain intention.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Some jade abacuses are small enough to fit inside bracelets and jewelry. We put the bigger ones into instruments of calculation so we can simulate the future and learn from the past.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Take the Matrix of Prescience here as an example. As long as sufficient information is provided, it can answer questions on anything — from the evolution of natural phenomena to the metabolism of living things.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: They say the theory behind the symbols was handed down by Nous, the Wisdomwalker. The principles are so profound that in the Divination Commission only the master diviner truly understands them.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: So they're computers?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Seems like it, but "jade abacus" does sound a lot better.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Besides, ordinary computers don't have cool backstories. Technology handed down from Nous, huh...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Even in Madam Herta's space station, I never saw anything related to Nous.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: So they're just microchips?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: It sounds like similar technology. Maybe we'll get a better understanding if we see the manufacturing process with our own eyes.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: I'm afraid that's impossible — the Artisanship Commission's Hall of Jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: But if you're interested, there's a shop selling jade abacus jewelry in Starskiff Haven — I can show you around when I'm free.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Did you hear that, ? She said she's taking Mr. Yang jewelry shopping. Hehe, that'll be interesting.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Anyway, don't dwell on names. As long as the machine works, what does it matter whether it's a "jade abacus" or a "computer"?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Just like today — would it have mattered if "Baique" had brought you here instead of Qingque? It makes no difference at all.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: We're almost at the Matrix of Prescience core. The master diviner should be waiting.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jingzhai]: Hmm. Meta algorithm reading complete, inputting jade abacus for simulation.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jingzhai]: Divination inference complete, hexagrammatic position established. Fluctuation range is between the marsh and water trigrams. Error margin of 0.2%.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jingzhai]: The algorithm is correct. So what's interfering with the instruments...?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Diviner Fu, how are things progressing?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: We're fluctuating between the heaven and thunder trigrams. A step forward bridges no distance hence.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: ...And for those who don't speak Fu Xuan?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Ahem... it's an utter disaster. How's that for a Divination Commission fortune?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: The Matrix of Prescience has stopped operating and the symbols have dimmed. There are Stellaron spirits wreaking havoc inside the commission and the Cloud Knights are struggling to protect civilians. I want to restore the Matrix of Prescience but I have no forces available.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: And on top of all that, General, we still have to deal with the Stellaron Hunter you handed to us. If that's not an utter disaster, then I don't know what is.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Haha, but you're Fu Xuan the seer — the boundless omniscient! Bringing luck and avoiding misfortune is your strong suit, isn't it?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: You don't need to flatter me, General. It's natural for fortune to fluctuate — there's no escaping it.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: The Divination Commission simply does its best to uncover the good and the bad and then make the right decisions. We have no magical means to turn the tide.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: And that is precisely why we need you in charge. When it comes to handling clairvoyant Stellaron Hunters, who better than Fu Xuan the seer? As for reinforcements, you didn't think I'd be unprepared, did you?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Look, help has just arrived.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Master Diviner, I've brought you the guests, though... it wasn't your order I received.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: *sigh* So, general... even guests are on the payroll these days?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Well, since they're here already, I may as well make use of them.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Entering the Matrix of Prescience without my permission is a breach of protocol...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: *sigh* ...would be an ungracious thing to say in the present circumstances. I admit, I'm pleasantly surprised to see you here.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Qingque is often unreliable, but she comes through for us when the need arises.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Glad to have us as your errand runners, aren't you?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: It's nice to have people I can entrust with difficult matters. I'm not like the general, and you don't even belong to my commission — I certainly won't be bossing you around.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: I thought you were going to have us escorted out.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: I was waiting for the Matrix of Prescience to resume operations so that you might gain insight into my divination techniques... *sigh* It was rude of me to keep you waiting so long.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: No need for the formalities, we heard what the general said... If you need something from us, just say the word.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Very well, then I'll keep this brief. The Divination Commission is currently understaffed. I need your help to restart the Matrix of Prescience's base terminals... and eliminate the Stellaron spirits along the way.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Won't we be breaching Xianzhou secrets in the process?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Yes, but you needn't worry. You have my permission.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: I don't know anything about this Matrix of Prescience.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Qingque will accompany you. She'll be in charge of restarting the terminal. As for eliminating the spirits...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Psst, ... I hath divined our future — we're destined to be errand runners forever...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Just say the magic word!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: ...Wh—What? Which magic word?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: *sigh* The universal one: "please."
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: ...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Ugh... Please!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Good enough.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Qingque, restarting the base terminals will be your responsibility.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Oh, and forget everything you saw and heard just now.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Is this what I get? No reward and a bunch of extra work...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: *sigh* The master diviner wants me to restart the Matrix of Prescience's base terminals... and bring you along for the ride.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Your time to shine!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Chance to impress the boss!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: I sense a promotion and a raise!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Ugh, I worked so hard on getting transferred to the repository — it's the best place to slack off and be invisible.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Now I actually have career prospects... this is terrible.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: If I screw it up, they might fire me... but if I get it done right, they'll send me more work!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: I'm gonna ask more questions next time... I could be playing celestial jade right now.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: I'm gonna ask more questions next time... I could be playing celestial jade right now.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: It's been a while, my astral guests.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Thanks to you, the Luofu has successfully brought Kafka to justice... I am truly grateful — there hadn't been a single Stellaron Hunter arrest since the Interastral Peace Corporation issued their bounty. Hehe, this is a victory for the Xianzhou.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: So, are you guys and the IPC in direct competition?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: How can we compete when our paths diverge? The Alliance has taken an oath to hunt down undying abominations, while the IPC is dedicated to their "preservation." The Alliance and the Corporation occasionally work together, but ultimately, our ways are different.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Still, it's a pleasure for me to be able to say that the Xianzhou has captured a criminal wanted by the IPC, haha.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Still...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Let's split this huge bounty 50/50.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Once this is over and the Stellaron curse has been lifted, the Xianzhou will have no more use for Kafka. If you wish to claim the bounty, feel free to take her to the IPC — the Alliance has no interest in the IPC's reward.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Blade, on the other hand, is a wanted criminal for the Xianzhou — he must remain with us.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: You didn't give us the full picture of your plan for Kafka.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Fu Xuan's Matrix of Prescience was able to go one step further than Kafka. To maintain the upper hand, I had to keep it a surprise. I hope this hasn't made you doubt my sincerity?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Next time, maybe ease off on the surprises?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: I promise to be more transparent next time.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: At present, Kafka has no intention of speaking and the Stellaron Hunters' motives remain unknown. We must rely on the power of the Divination Commission to unearth the truth.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: "Unearth the truth..." You mean interrogate Kafka with the Matrix of Prescience?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Precisely, the Matrix of Prescience is the Divination Commission's ultimate weapon. It was originally used to calculate navigation routes and predict future events...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: ...but the secrets of the Stellaron Hunters cannot remain hidden any longer. I have no choice but to move beyond conventional protocol — we must use divination to ascertain Kafka's intent.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Jing Yuan]: Everything hinges on restoring the Matrix of Prescience, which is why I would like you to help Diviner Fu complete the setup. I am eternally grateful for your assistance.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Let me see, this is the Temporal Terminal.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: "Observes the potential of the temporal plane." They say this terminal is designed to retrieve information related to time.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Activate base terminal
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: That should do it.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: What? You just matched up those symbols. Is that it?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: The more complex something is, the more important it is to keep it simple. Don't you think?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: If it's so simple, why didn't your master diviner come and do it herself?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Hehe, maybe deep down she just wants to be lazy once in a while — like me!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: I will guard the Matrix core. Once we've restarted the three terminals, Kafka's interrogation can commence.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: When we're finished, I'll give you enough time to talk to her.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: What happens when you activate the Matrix of Prescience?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Once activated, the Matrix of Prescience analyzes all the information contained in the target — Kafka in this case — and transfers anything pertaining to the Xianzhou into the diviner's consciousness.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Every one of us walks a Path, moving ceaselessly through time and space, creating all manner of karma in our wake...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: How are things progressing? I have yet to sense the connection between the three base terminals.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Why not use it to calculate the location of the Stellaron?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Divination is no mere conjecture. If the parameters are insufficient and uncertainty surrounds the target, then it is like looking for a needle in a galaxy. Do you understand?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Furthermore, interference caused by the Stellaron spirits that infiltrated the Commission has greatly reduced the accuracy of our divination. The margin of error could be as high as 0.2%! I cannot tolerate such inaccuracies in our interpretations.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: So, have you activated the terminals yet? Why is the Matrix of Prescience still unresponsive?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: What if its calculations are incorrect?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: There is no "what if"! ...Because nothing remains unforeseen.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: The Matrix's algorithm is known as "the way of all change" — it accounts for every unpredictability on the Path of all things with uncountable enumerations. When your objects of measure are eras of time and oceans of stars, there are no true variables in the world.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: ...No more questions! Have you activated the three terminals!?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Say no more. Seriously, please don't say anything else.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: What the heck is this? It looks like a walking gate...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Take it easy, there's nothing supernatural on the Xianzhou. It's an aurumaton — it's guarding the Matrix of Prescience. They're stationed at various strategic places.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: I feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something... Are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: We're here by order of the master diviner to restart the Matrix of Prescience — friends not foes.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Malfunctioning Aurumaton]: Passage... prohibited...!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Ah...! March, you should join the Divination Commission! Q—Quick, do something!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: This must be the Spatial Terminal. They say this terminal is designed to retrieve information related to space. You probably could've guessed that...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Let me guess — time, karma... I bet the next terminal is energy-related!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Darn, the Spatial Terminal. They say this terminal is designed to retrieve information related to space. You probably could've guessed that...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Activate base terminal
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Done, next.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: This must be the Karma Terminal. They say this terminal is designed to establish the causal relationships between objects.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][March 7th]: Let me guess — time, space... I bet the next terminal is energy-related!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Darn, the Karma Terminal. They say this terminal is designed to establish causal relationships.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Activate base terminal
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Done, next.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Phew, we did it. All three terminals activated.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Qingque]: Let's go back to the core and report to the master diviner.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Well done, all of you. I can sense the Matrix of Prescience symbols re-illuminating.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Now, to interrogate Kafka. Those of you in the core may feel a few... impacts.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Are you ready?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Ready.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Not quite.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Kafka]: Is this really necessary? I said I'd cooperate with you.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: I have no interest in the words of wanted criminals — especially those skilled in the art of manipulation...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: ...so say what you will — I'm here to witness the divination of the Matrix of Prescience.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: The Divination Commission has ways of extracting the truth, and they're far more effective than a conversation.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Kafka]: Then please, Master Diviner, witness my destiny.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Rise!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: That's... why you're here?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: ...All for that?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Kafka]: Well? Not what you were expecting?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: I can't believe it...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: ...But, the Matrix of Prescience cannot be wrong.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: What did you see?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: What did you do?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Has Kafka pulled one over on us again?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Kafka has nothing to do with the Stellaron, but you... It's you...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Ha! Absurd! I'd never have thought it...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: What just happened?
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: Tell us what's going on!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Narration]: I sense more Fu Xuan riddles on the horizon...
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: Ask her yourself — take as long as you wish.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Fu Xuan]: I must report this to the general immediately. Please excuse me!
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: ..., you go ask her.
[Omniscient Inquiry of Arcana][Welt]: I know you still have many questions for Kafka yourself.

[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: You go, . I don't wanna talk to that woman.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Be careful though. Don't get fooled by her again.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Are you kidding? I'm an expert now.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Huh, I wouldn't go that far.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Got it. Fool me twice, shame on me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: ...Fool you what now? Ugh, stop it, I'm getting Fu Xuan vibes.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Nah, you're the one more likely to get fooled.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Ha, I'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. I don't trust anyone except Dan Heng, Mr. Yang, Himeko, and you.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Be careful. Don't get fooled by her again.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Welt Yang
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: If there are questions you want Kafka to answer, now's the time.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: There are so many things I want to ask...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Then go. We'll stand guard.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Actually, I don't have anything to ask her.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: You don't want to know about her motives and your past?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Is there anything you want to know?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: There are many things I want to know — but they can wait.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: What will Kafka have to say to you? I'm curious to find out myself.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Hi, .
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...You haven't changed a bit.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: I'm sorry you have to see me in such a sorry state.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Don't act like we're friends.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Fine, if you prefer. Not friends.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Are you alright? Are you hurt?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Concerned about me? I'm fine, the Xianzhou is always courteous with its captives.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You don't look like you're in a sorry state to me...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Really? That's good. I wouldn't want to affect your image of me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: I didn't talk to you on the train because I knew you and I would get to talk alone here. Worth waiting for, don't you think? You seem to have a lot to ask me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: What is your objective?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Are you really innocent?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: What did Fu Xuan see?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...Elio said he foresaw three questions, but they would be the same in essence. If I were to hear one of them, I would then tell you the objective of this trip in all its detail.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Since you asked one of the three questions, it means everything is going smoothly. Are you ready to hear my answer?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Xianzhou's Stellaron problem is not directly linked to us. But if you look at it from Elio's perspective, you can't say the Stellaron Hunters are completely innocent. We foresaw all this long ago, but chose to remain indifferent until the time was right for us to get involved.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Diviner Fu was surprised because she discovered three truths: One, the Stellaron Hunters are not enemies of the Xianzhou. You know this now, though you refused to believe it.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Two, someone else brought the Stellaron into the Xianzhou and activated it — a result of internal unrest and external aggression. Traitors on the Luofu and enemies from outside want to overthrow the Xianzhou. The master diviner is in a hurry to find the general, presumably to inform him of this fact.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: However, that's all the master diviner knows, because Elio withheld key pieces of information from me. He foresaw the Divination Commission using the Matrix of Prescience against me. To guard against setbacks, he ensured that I knew only what he wanted the Xianzhou Alliance to know in this moment.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: As for number three, even in their wildest dreams, the Xianzhou Alliance could never have guessed it, haha... If the Stellaron Hunters aren't the cause of all this, then why are Bladie and I even here?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...We're here for you.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: For... us?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You're lying.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? It's no wonder Fu Xuan doesn't believe it either. But the Matrix of Prescience doesn't lie. The answer is just that bizarre: The Stellaron Hunters appearing here, Bladie getting arrested, me being lured to the Matrix of Prescience... it was all to bring you, the Astral Express crew, to the Xianzhou.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: In the future that Elio chose, the power of The Hunt is indispensable. That's why the Astral Express crew had to come to the Luofu and achieve something important for the Xianzhou. You had to establish a connection with the Alliance...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...and that's why I had to trick you into coming here. I needed you to meet the Luofu's general in person and help him resolve the Stellaron crisis. I needed the Alliance to owe you a favor. That way, in the future, at the most critical moment, the Xianzhou will offer you their help.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: What do you think? Surprised? The notorious Stellaron Hunters did all that just to make you a hero of the Xianzhou... Quite the plot twist, don't you think?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: What is this future you're talking about?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You're lying.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Why are you helping me?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew.mp4
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Like I said: Elio withheld key pieces of information from me. The future holds endless possibilities. Knowing the right thing at the wrong time could spoil all our hard work.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: There is only one thing I can tell you about the future: In the best and the worst cases, you will eventually have to face Nanook the Destruction. When that time comes, you will need all the help you can get. It will be a brutal struggle of Aeonic proportions...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...proportions that neither you, nor I, nor the Astral Express will ever be able to reach. In the vast majority of futures, that's when destiny ends. But if we follow Elio's plan, there may be a glimmer of hope on the horizon.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...You know, , even Aeons can be killed.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: Hey, Luocha, you didn't finish telling us about the Propagation! Keep going — it's interesting. So Aeons can die, huh? Weird, I thought THEY were invincible...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: There is no true invincibility or immortality in the world — such exaggerations are born of the perspectives of ordinary beings. Nonetheless, ordinary beings could not have orchestrated the fall of the Propagation... That Aeon was slain at the hands of another Aeon.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: ...I don't understand. They're all Aeons, why do they want to fight?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: You... Are you really from the Xianzhou!? Other Aeons aside, surely you must know the story of Lan and Yaoshi? Isn't destroying the Aeon Yaoshi the Alliance's cherished aim?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: Of course, I know! Well, I know a little. My mum made me practice with swords all day — I didn't really go to school...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: In that case... let's just change the subject. If you don't know about the feud between The Hunt and the Abundance, I'm afraid there's just too much to explain.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: Fine, how's this for a subject — what's in the box?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: Oh... this one? It's a casket, more commonly known as a coffin. It's for containing the remains of the deceased.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: The deceased... A—Aren't you a merchant?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: Yes indeed, this is just part of my job. I was asked to deliver this coffin to the Xianzhou. Ah, I'd quite forgotten — for long-life species, death is probably a distant concept?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: Nope. The Cloud Knights spend a lot of time on the battlefield — death is a common occurrence. It's just, we don't put bodies in boxes — uh — coffins... In Xianzhou, people go to the Hall of Karma in the Ten-Lords Commission and consecrate the names and jade abacuses of the dead. It's our way of saying goodbye.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: The Foxians and the Vidyadhara have their own ceremonies. Foxian soldiers place their dead in Starskiffs and then let them drift out into the stars. They call it "the Returning."
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: As for the Vidyadhara, they're... more mysterious. They say that when a Vidyadhara is very old or has a fatal injury, they turn into an egg that looks like a pearl. When the shell breaks, they come out looking young again...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: My mum calls the Vidyadhara "Long's Scions." When I was young, she told me stories of how the Vidyadhara could turn into dragons. I don't know if that's true...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: It's true.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Only special Vidyadhara can turn into dragons.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: It's just a legend.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: What do you know? Silent but deadly speaks.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Dan Heng]: ...Your mother is right. The Vidyadhara are Long's Scions. They are descendants of the Aeon of Permanence. That was why some, but not all, could turn into dragons.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Dan Heng]: The power was a rare inheritance, passed down only to those who could successfully complete numerous rites and challenges. For the inheritor, it was hard to say whether it was a blessing or a curse.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: ...I've heard the story of Long the Permanence and THEIR descendants. Many myths and legends praise the Aeon for a rich and immortal life.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: But for some reason, the Aeon disappeared among the stars without a trace — almost as if THEY had never existed... leaving only THEIR descendants.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Dan Heng]: ...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: Every life has its limit. Even the Aeons are not truly immortal and will eventually reach the end of their lives.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: Uh, let me ask you one more question... Do you know the person in the coffin?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: Huh... Yes.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: Friend?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: No.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Sushang]: So, uh... a sweetheart?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: Haha, miss, whatever gave you that impression? The individual in the coffin is neither friend nor relative — we met only once. By chance, I made someone a promise, and so I have to run this errand.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Luocha]: Let's leave it at that, shall we? I think we've all had enough rest.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: (After completing sub-mission Tranquil Amidst Turmoil
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Meanwhile in the Divination Commission...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...You know, , even Aeons can be killed.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: So your plan is... to kill an Aeon?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Ha, are you kidding? That's not what we want.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: I just want to tell stories from the past: stories about Aeons that have fallen.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Killing an Aeon? Humans don't have that power.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: That's right, it would be impossible for a human...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...but then I didn't bring humans into the picture, did I?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: How could an Aeon possibly be killed?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Is it so unthinkable? There are many stories about fallen Aeons.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Long the Permanence, Idrila the Beauty, Ena the Order, Tayzzyronth the Propagation... Akivili the Trailblaze.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: These names were once known all over the universe. Now, THEY've all but disappeared, leaving behind only masterless Paths.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Currently, there are three ways an Aeon can perish known to humanity.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: One: Paths with overlapping concepts will eventually collide, and the broader Path will engulf the narrower one. That's how Ena the Order was assimilated by Xipe the Harmony.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Two: In a war between Aeons, the stronger side will annihilate the weaker one — that's how Tayzzyronth the Propagation fell. Under the guidance of The Hunt, the Xianzhou Alliance travels the universe exterminating "abominations" cultivated by the Abundance...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...so the Xianzhou too are engaged in this process.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Why does the Xianzhou want to kill the Abundance?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: As far as I know, the predecessors of the Alliance were the Elixir Seekers. They searched for Yaoshi and longed for the blessing of immortality. When they eventually found the Aeon, they received a blessing that did indeed prevent death — the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...But immortality turned out to be a curse for the Xianzhou. That's when The Hunt appeared — firing an arrow and felling the Ambrosial Arbor. Ever since, the Alliance has followed The Hunt in pursuit of Yaoshi, erasing the curse of immortality from the universe along the way.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: How did Tayzzyronth die?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: After the disappearance of Long the Permanence, Tayzzyronth divided the Aeon's Path. In the process, Tayzzyronth became a new Aeon known as the Propagation. My understanding is that Tayzzyronth, or "Imperator Insectorum" to some, didn't last long...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...When the Swarm Disaster began to take hold, Tayzzyronth was attacked and killed by multiple Aeons.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: What about Akivili? Did THEY die at the hands of an Aeon?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: I don't know. Akivili's disappearance was very mysterious. Nous is probably the only one that can answer that question. After all, Droidhead knows everything.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: What do you think, ? Fascinating stories, no?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: They're the kind of stories that folks on the straight and narrow would never tell you.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: What about the third way?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Why are you telling me this?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Do you believe all this nonsense?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: ...Hold on, any minute now.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Aha, it's begun!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Let's go, Bladie.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Kafka]: Two more places to visit.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Did Kafka escape? Argh, how are we gonna explain this to the master diviner!?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: : If what she said is true, we won't have to explain anything...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: ...Hey, did she brainwash you!?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Wasn't this the dead tree Qingque showed us earlier? How did it grow all of a sudden?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Amazing, absolutely amazing! Even the long-lived might not witness something like this in their lifetime! I'm so lucky!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Maybe someone applied a strong fertilizer?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: The Ambrosial Arbor was imbued with some kind of power...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Such extraordinary energy... It's the Stellaron.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Mr. Yang, do you mean... the Stellaron is making the Ambrosial Arbor grow?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Yes, the Stellaron the Cloud Knights are searching for must be causing this anomaly!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Unless Kafka deceived the Matrix of Prescience...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Stay calm, Diviner Fu, the Matrix of Prescience does not lie. The logic you have laid out concerning Kafka makes sense — it has helped me to fill in another piece of the puzzle.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: I agree there is a hostile external force at work on the Luofu. The Stellaron didn't appear out of thin air — someone managed to sneak it onto the ship. As for the culprits behind the Luofu's internal strife, I believe we are dealing with the so-called Disciples of Sanctus Medicus — that shadowy organization of the Denizens of Abundance.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Kafka's revelations confirm my suspicions.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: You... General, when did you have these suspicions?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: The moment the planter of the Stellaron revealed themself. The Xianzhou has the blessing of the Reignbow Arbiter — only another Aeon's Emanator would be capable of sneaking onto this ship without my knowing. We are dealing with an external threat.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: The Stellaron corrosion continues to flood into the ship, and yet it bypassed both the Seat of Divine Foresight and The Shackling Prison... there is forethought here — our enemy must have had access to Luofu intelligence for things to unfold in this way. It is evident now...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: The Stellaron Hunters aren't the ones behind the curtain... No, as soon as I set eyes on Blade, it was clear to me. But why is he here, and why did he draw the Astral Express? ...That piece of the puzzle still eludes me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Nevertheless, Lady Fu, your intel means the puzzle is more complete than it was before, haha. These Stellaron Hunters are a captivating group — such lengths to get the Xianzhou and the Express onto the same track. Who would've believed it?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: General, we must retain all urgency! The Ambrosial Arbor...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: It's the Stellaron. No need to search high and low — the traitors have planted it in the Ambrosial Arbor's delve, thereby causing the tree to grow once again. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus couldn't hold off any longer.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Every crisis is a turning point. A problem is easier to resolve when you know where it lies.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: ...Am I coming up with the plan again?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Of course, I'm sure you have a countermeasure at the ready, Master Diviner.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: From my perspective, convening the Cloud Knights is our immediate priority. We must head into the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor, expel the Stellaron spirits, and prevent the Arbor's resurrection.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Mhmm, as ever the master diviner's omniscia provides the fastest solution. However, sometimes speed is not everything. I have known the Stellaron's location for a while now, so why have I held back our forces?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: General.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Well?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: ...You're a scoundrel.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Haha, pulling up the grass requires removing the roots. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have chosen to make their move now, which means the Cloud Knights have the situation under control and the traitors have run out of patience. Now is the time to capture them all in one fell swoop.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: You've been sitting on that this whole time? How will you justify the losses if something goes wrong, General!?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Please, Lady Fu, I still have forces to deploy.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: We were in need of extra hands, and the Stellaron Hunters were kind enough to bring us together with the Astral Express — how could I look the other way.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Listen up! We've got a situation!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: That massive tree has suddenly sprung to life!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Let me guess, more errands?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: The general's smiling again — definitely errands...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: It's my fault. I had higher expectations of the general...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Please! We can't keep getting them to do everything for us! Since when did we run out of people on the Luofu?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: You... Why are you staring at me?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Do I need to remind you, general, that the Ambrosial Arbor's access point is a closely guarded secret? Allowing outworlders would be—
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: A violation of the rules and regulations. I would like to remind you, Lady Fu, that the Xianzhou comes before its rules and regulations — all the more so in times of crisis.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: As such, I am about to make a decision that runs counter to those rules and regulations. Oh, uh — decisions, plural. Haha, what a rare pleasure.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Lady Fu, I hereby issue you with the military tally — the Cloud Knights will be under your control. You will act in concert with the other forces in the approach to the Ambrosial Arbor through the Alchemy Commission delve.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Under... my control?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: You've been eager to discover for yourself what it is to be a general, have you not?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: You've never given me the opportunity, and now suddenly... Understood, as you wish.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: As for our Astral friends... I hereby formally welcome you all to join our operation to seal the Stellaron.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Lady Fu will deploy the Cloud Knights, but I would like you to set off in advance. Take a shortcut through the Artisanship Commission and convene with Lady Fu further down the line.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Orders received, General.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: This is no order, honored guests. I am merely stating what needs to be done, should you wish to help us.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: You've never really seen us as outsiders, huh.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Errands received, General.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: This is no errand, honored guests. I am merely stating what needs to be done, should you wish to help us.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: You've never really seen us as outsiders, huh.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Payment, or we go on strike!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Understood, understood, worry not — I know how to repay a favor.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: The Xianzhou has met with a dramatic chain of events, and each of you has chosen to stand by us. Your fearlessness moves me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Nevertheless, the enemy is upon us and time is of the essence — let us not allow monetary affairs to cast a shadow over more pressing matters.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Once catastrophe has been averted, we shall discuss this in greater detail.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Miss Tingyun, I would like you to continue to serve as a guide for our Astral friends.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: ...Of course general, I am duty-bound.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: The Alchemy Commission and Scalegorge Waterscape delves are adjacent to the Ambrosial Arbor's seal. I'd like you to investigate these places.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: What exactly is the Ambrosial Arbor?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: It is an ancient artifact that was planted on the Xianzhou Luofu by Yaoshi, the Aeon of Abundance. It has the power to shape life and subdue death at will.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: The ancestors of the Luofu people consumed the fruits of the Ambrosial Arbor and gained endless lifespans — thus becoming long-life species.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Sounds like an amazing treasure!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Yes... it was also the bane of everything to come.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Aren't you happy about the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: As outsiders, you are unfamiliar with the history of the Xianzhou. I cannot blame you for asking a question like this. Let me tell you a story.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Long ago, before the Xianzhou took to the skies, our ancestors lived on the surface of a planet. Like all of you, the Xianzhou people at that time were a mortal species with a lifespan of fewer than 100 years.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: There was a time when the ruling emperor could not bear his temporary existence, or the thought of his life's achievements being lost to another after his death. He became fixated on acquiring an elixir of immortality, and focused his power on constructing a fleet of nine ships. These ships would voyage into deep space, where traces of gods were rumored to exist...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Did he... succeed?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Yes, and no. He succeeded because, after an arduous journey, the nine ships eventually witnessed the manifestation of a god — Yaoshi's appearance provided for all manner of unfathomable celestial blessings... However, he failed because the fleet has been lost ever since, and has never been able to return to its home planet.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: That doesn't sound so bad. The Xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Oh...? Our ancestors once thought so too, but the miracle of longevity was nothing more than a vain dream.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Take the Luofu, for example — immortality seemed like a beautiful thing. But what followed was population expansion and diminishing resources. In the struggle for survival, the immortals lost their humanity and degenerated into mere beasts.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: After paying the price with blood and tears, the Luofu people finally understood that immortality was not a free blessing, but the beginning of a cruel ordeal.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: In the eras that followed, other beings that had likewise received Yaoshi's blessings repeatedly attacked the Xianzhou in an attempt to take the sacred artifact as their own. Countless atrocities were committed as a result.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Many Xianzhou comrades who were lucky enough to survive the wars became stricken with mara — a condition that immortals are susceptible to.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Had it not been for the enlightenment and protection of the Reignbow Arbiter, the Xianzhou Alliance you see today would never have existed.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: At this point in the story, I assume you understand the disasters that the resurrection of the Ambrosial Arbor might bring about?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You said there were traitors inside the Luofu?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Thousands of years have passed since the Reignbow Arbiter felled the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Most in the Xianzhou regard the Arbor as nothing more than the stump of a dead tree... Only those familiar with our history and the ancient texts know of its origin.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Our ancestors placed the stump in full view of the people precisely to make it seem unimportant, but in fact, they sealed it behind layers upon layers of delve enchantment. Even if one travels toward the Ambrosial Arbor, one will never reach it.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: Someone brought a Stellaron into the Xianzhou and planted it among the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor. They wish to resurrect it and achieve their hidden goal through external aggression.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: In my opinion, the force that provided the Stellaron and the force that activated it have different objectives.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Let's delay no longer. We should be moving.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Jing Yuan]: I have asked Fu Xuan to open a shortcut to the Divination Commission for you.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: *sigh* I thought I might be relieved of my guiding duties once the Divination Commission affair was over...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Who would've thought the general would take such a liking to you? I suppose I must accompany you further... Fate can be so unpredictable.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Through thick and thin, we're like two peas in a dangerous pod.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: You have quite the sense of humor, benefactors... I've encountered more trouble with you than I have with the merchant fleet in ten years.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: I just hope everything is smooth-sailing from now on — please look after me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: This could be your moment to shine for the Sky-Faring Commission.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: I understand. The Luofu is in danger, and members of the six commissions should stand united.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: *sigh* You did save my life at Cloudford... Consider this my returning the favor.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Are you afraid of the danger, Miss Tingyun?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: The general said there are traitors aboard the ship.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: But only someone from the six commissions could bring the Stellaron into the Xianzhou undetected, let alone plant it within the Ambrosial Arbor...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You mean... the general?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You mean... the master diviner?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: You mean... Yukong?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: I am saying nothing of the sort, just raising a doubt, that's all. Please be careful, benefactors...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: If there's nothing else, we should get going.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Y—You want to leave straight away? Let me pack some things. I'll be right there.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: Phew, that was scary. I was having a snack in the repository when the Ambrosial Arbor started to grow — the trunk suddenly shot right up into the sky. So the legends were right all along...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: Such is life, full of surprises. That's why you gotta seize any opportunity to take a break — who knows when trouble will come knocking at your door.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Given what you just saw, you don't seem rattled at all.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: It'll be fine. Even if the sky collapses, we have the master diviner with us to hold it up. Oh, and now we have the general here too.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: What do subordinates like us have to panic about? Let the big shots worry about the big events. That's the secret to happiness.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Didn't the master diviner give you any work to do?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: She did — she saw me on her way over. She told me to go to the repository and read up on anything related to the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: A simple task like that is only fifteen minutes' work for me.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: I heard people say even the general has to watch his manners when asking you for help — pretty impressive! I don't have much to offer you... Uh, here! Take this book. It's the thought that counts!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: We've gotta get going.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: I was gonna wait for the master diviner to get off work so I could show you around and teach Mr. Yang how to play celestial jade.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Your kindness is much appreciated, Miss Qingque. As for celestial jade, we'll have to leave it for next time.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: I know, I know, you've got an important task ahead... sorry to keep you. Priorities are priorities.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Qingque]: Well then, get back safely. Remember to come find me in Exalting Sanctum!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: A step forward bridges no distance hence... Ugh, the hexagram was right.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: The Ambrosial Arbor was felled thousands of years ago... now it returns to life. The future of Xianzhou is difficult to divine.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: I'm sorry... Kafka escaped.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: I had long anticipated it.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Huh? She's not angry? *sigh* Is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Pursuing Kafka is a waste of time and effort — The Matrix of Prescience informed me of her innocence. Our priority is the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Are you leading forces into the Alchemy Commission?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: From the time the Stellaron corrosion began to spread until now, the only reports we've received on the Alchemy Commission have come from alchemists and doctors stationed in other delves.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: The Alchemy Commission is where the Xianzhou's medical research and production take place. However, due to its proximity to the Ambrosial Arbor's seal, I'm afraid the Stellaron spirits may have plunged it into a deeper crisis than we first feared.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: To make matters worse, the general suspects there are traitors in the Alchemy Commission. The self-proclaimed Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have been plotting this for a long time — now they're using the location to their advantage. I must take action as soon as possible.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: The general wants us to go to the Artisanship Commission...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: He really is a delegator at heart, isn't he... There isn't much distance between the Artisanship and Alchemy Commissions — I'm afraid the former is likely also facing imminent catastrophe.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: The starskiff is ready — I will lead the way.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Um, I wanna chat with others as well.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: , where are you going? The starskiff is ahead of us — follow my lead.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: I still have important tasks from the general to attend to. Go carefully, all of you.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Wait, wait! Master Diviner, can you divine our fortunes for us? Is there anything we need to watch out for?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: ...No need.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: My omniscia has seen that your journey will be auspicious — everything will proceed smoothly.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: A—Are you sure? You don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: I'm sure it's nothing we can't manage. Let's go!
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Well said, . Thank you for your assurance, Master Diviner. Onward.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: What's the delay? If you're worried about the road ahead, I've already told you — the hexagram indicates the auspicious result.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Fu Xuan]: Don't believe me? Fine. Fate is fickle — better to believe in yourself than look to the sky.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Artisanship Commission
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Huh? Look at all the people gathered here... Not a good day for commuting on the Luofu.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: The Artisanship Commission delve should have suspended operations after the Stellaron corrosion began. Why haven't these people taken starskiffs to safety?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Maybe the Artisanship Commission are just more dedicated to their work? The Divination Commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: *sigh* At the end of the day, work is work — you need it to live. Y'know March, adults forget what "relaxation" means after a certain age, hehe...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: Sounds like you're speaking from experience...
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Just speaking from the heart, that's all.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: The Path of Trailblaze doesn't seem to allow for any "relaxation" either.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][March 7th]: I think they call that "complaining from the heart."
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Are any of the Paths in this world easy to tread?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Narration]: Maybe they're here to welcome us?
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: That's it~! First you arrive out of the blue, then the general recruits you to the cause — it's like the stories where imperial heroes bring salvation to the world.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Still, it doesn't look like they're rolling out the red carpet... We might be getting ahead of ourselves.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: The Artisanship Commission is full of workshops, buildings, state-of-the-art mechanisms, and craftsmen designing brand-new concepts.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: Periodically stirring up trouble is part of their tradition... entire buildings vanishing into thin air, puppet riots — you get the picture.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Tingyun]: It seems like the craftsmen are too afraid to go in, but they have nowhere to run to either. We should take care, benefactors — something terrible must have happened.
[Wood Sprouts Anew, Fate Tilts Askew][Welt]: Either way, we'll have to go in. Let's ask around first.

[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Dan Heng]: ...mara-struck.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: It looks like someone's hurt!
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Dan Heng]: Wait! Let's think before we act.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][???]: ...
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: Silent but deadly, Luocha, let's charge in together. If we take them out quickly, we can rescue the girl!
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Luocha]: What happened to "us letting you handle it"?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: I—I've only got two hands! Please — I'll wangle you a prize for your bravery or something when it's all over!
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Dan Heng]: Enough, let's go!
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: Miss, are you okay?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][???]: ...What do you think?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: Ah... Sorry, I didn't see any blood, so I thought you were okay... You're a puppet.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][???]: My motor is broken — I can't move.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][???]: Are you a Cloud Knight? ...Good. Take me to the Realm-Keeping Commission.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: I, ah...
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: Luocha, silent but deadly, I'm afraid we have to delay things again... This lady is one of the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. As a Cloud Knight, I must prioritize her orders.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: I'm sorry... If I'd known I wouldn't have got you to come with me. You'd probably be there by now if you'd gone by yourself...
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Luocha]: I happen to have some medical knowledge — perhaps I can treat the young lady's injuries.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: Well, it's just... she's a puppet. I think we should just take her to the Realm-Keeping Commission?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Luocha]: Don't worry, Miss Sushang — leave it to me.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Tranquil Amidst Turmoil.mp4
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Luocha]: You might get an aching or numbing sensation, but it shouldn't be too painful... Do you think you can hold still?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: It won't work... My body is mechanical, not flesh and blood—
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Luocha]: Be it mechanical or organic, we're still dealing with composite substances. I just hope you'll tolerate my methods...
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: ...Curious.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Sushang]: H—How... What kind of "medical knowledge" is this!?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Dan Heng]: The Abundance...
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Luocha]: ...
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: Very good — we no longer need to return to the Realm-Keeping Commission. The mission continues.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: As a judge in the employ of the Ten-Lords Commission, I am forbidden from interfering in the affairs of outsiders. However, seeing as you came to my aid, a word of advice: Leave as soon as possible.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: I came to address the root of our crisis by arresting a fugitive — a Stellaron Hunter. This villain possesses exceptional swordsmanship and wields a divine weapon — they are extremely dangerous.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Dan Heng]: ...!
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: If it hadn't been for a strange accident, my wakespan might have been cut short.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Dan Heng]: Strange... accident?
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: Come with me.
[Tranquil Amidst Turmoil][Xueyi]: I've never seen anything like it.

[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Apprentice]: I've never seen the Ambrosial Arbor look like this before... Is this how it looked back in the day?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: The gate is closed. Just like the metals from which it was forged, it emanates a cold indifference.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: *sigh* Another locked gate. Time for the old dilemma — break in or climb over?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: A warm reminder, benefactors, that the Artisanship Commission is as important to the Xianzhou as the Divination Commission.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: Our law states that trespassing into the Artisanship Commission can result in a prison sentence of between 300 to 500 years... Serious violations may result in exile on a barren planet, thousands of light-years away...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: I'm sure they'll be lenient given the circumstances...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: The general sent us here — surely we get a pass?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: Yes, we do. Still, the Artisanship Commission is filled with security mechanisms. Even the general won't be able to save us in time if we get trapped.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: It's law-breaking time!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: ...You gonna be this enthusiastic when it's jail-sentencing time?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: I'm not trying to scare you — I'm simply suggesting you ask the craftsmen to see if they can provide an insider like Qingque to guide you.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: It seems more than a little reckless to charge in when we don't know what's ahead of us.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: This is bad, master, he...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: I won't be able to graduate at this rate...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Master Gongshu...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: *gasp* Are you guys Cloud Knights? Are you here to save us?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: ...Your clothes. *sigh* I knew I was getting ahead of myself — you're just tourists.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Sorry this crisis came during your trip. *sigh* I'm sorry it came at all...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Worry no more. The knight in shining armor is here to the rescue.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Fret not. I'm the cavalry the general sent for.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: There comes a time when we all feel sorry...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Yeah, you just need to tell us what the trouble is, hehe~ General Jing Yuan pulled out all the stops to get us here — you can trust us.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: ...You mean the general invited you? Is that a joke? The Luofu has the Cloud Knights — why would he send outsiders?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: There's been a serious incident in the Artisanship Commission — nobody's in the mood for jokes, miss.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: You misunderstand, young sir — we genuinely want to help. Can you tell us what happened here?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: What are you doing out here?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Waiting around, that's what. We ran away, it was way too dangerous in there.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Please, if you plan on living a little longer, don't go in there.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: What happened in there?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: There's been some kind of botanical disaster — it was like an ornamental tree somewhere suddenly started to grow. There were branches so thick you couldn't put your arms around them! It spread everywhere — the whole Commission is being destroyed.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: I don't get it, the Artisanship Commission focuses on the mechanical — we've got nothing to do with hydroponics or accelerated growth... Where did that thing come from?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: You should leave.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: The worst thing is... my master is still inside!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Master Gongshu is the most experienced craftsman in the Artisanship Commission's smelting works — he's in charge of our research project.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: When the incident happened, he dragged me, Ziming, and Yunche to safety... But then he turned around and ran back in.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: I need to wait here for the Cloud Knights so I can tell them to rescue him.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: ...Why did he run back in?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: To save his research data?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Is research data more important than life?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Project deadline approaching?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: That's not how it works — the research comes first here.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Did none of you try to stop him?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: We didn't have time — we were scrambling for our lives! If I had an extra pair of arms, maybe I could've tried.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: I just heard him shout "It's gone! We lost the furnace!" By the time we realized, he'd already vanished.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: Anyway... you said you're here to help us, right?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: 100%. The general sent us.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: You don't have to believe us — the Astral Express doesn't shout about its achievements! We'll look for your master.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: In that case, take this jade seal with you.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: If you find my master, please bring him out safe and sound! If anything happens to him...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: Don't worry, young sir. Your master's safety is our—
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Awei]: None of us will be able to graduate this year...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: ...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Let's go, I think this conversation's run its course...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: "Botanical disaster"? It must be the Ambrosial Arbor...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: ...but what about the "furnace" his master mentioned?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Chengjie]: The road of the augury is woe
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Chengjie]: Thank fortunes I put up the shifting screen
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Chengjie]: As expected, the divination was correct.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Chengjie]: If I hadn't repaired the Shifting Screen today we'd all have been trapped — we'd be fertilizer by now.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Chengjie]: Still, the teleportation range wasn't enough...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: Who are those four people
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Yunche]: Who knows?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: Maybe they are visitors who are fleeing?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: It's no ordinary tree — the branches felt tough as metal...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: Yunche, have you ever seen material like that before?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Yunche]: What if I have — you gonna go get a sample for me?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: I was thinking about it, yeah. Isn't it just an ornamental tree?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Yunche]: Have you ever seen an ornamental tree move? Have you ever seen one bore through the ground like that?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: So what if it moves? I just need to run over and saw off a sample. It can't grow faster than I can run, right?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Yunche]: Sure, go ahead. Here's a crowbar and a saw! Don't say I didn't warn you when the Cloud Knights have to scrape you off the walls.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Ziming]: Well, I... I—I've been feeling a bit under the weather lately. *cough* Yunche, you're the most agile person on the materials team! When it comes to operational efficiency—
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Yunche]: Under the weather!? How convenient. As for me — I'd rather stay alive, thanks!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: The Stellaron facilitated the resurrection of the Ambrosial Arbor...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: The severity of the corrosion becomes worse as it grows.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: *sigh* Look, the roots are coming up through the ground. I'm afraid we've got some gardening work to do.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: Upon Commission grounds your feet do tread! Leave from whence you came or soon be dead! Deaaaad!!!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: Stay away! If you come any further, I'll not spare you!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Hold on, let us explain! We're not—
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: What excuses do you have? Surprise me! Just passing by? Stumbled in? Door wide open? HMM?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: Within Commission grounds today was sewn, an evil spun by hands unseen, unknown! No longer!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: If the security mechanisms didn't teach you a lesson, these robots will!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: Golden Cloud Toad! Illumination Dragonfish! ...Are you alright? Wake up! I raised you like my own flesh and blood...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][???]: Did you really have to destroy my little friends? I want compensation!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: You didn't want to listen to us! We were here to rescue you and you started a fight for no reason!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Are you Master Gongshu?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: How do you know my name, child?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Does the reputation of Gongshu Liang, "the smelter extraordinaire," precede one?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: This guy is pretty deluded for a "master..."
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Are you Awei's teacher?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Hmph! Did those hopeless brats send you here? It won't work! They abandoned the Commission's precious assets and ran off to save their own little skins!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Even if you rescue me, it won't change anything — all of them will fail their internships!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: ...It's not like that. You're making this too complicated...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: We're passing through on our way to the Alchemy Commission at the behest of General Jing Yuan and Diviner Fu. We'd like you to show us the way, Master Gongshu.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: R—Really? The general sent you? Then this must be a mere misunderstanding! Ah — don't worry about those things, easy to fix!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: But there's not much I can do to help! The Artisanship Commission was suddenly taken over by some evil tree demon. It seized our most precious possession — the Creation Furnace!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: It's a dark and powerful entity. The robots... it was like they gained consciousness — they were moving in a circle around it. I fear approaching it is tantamount to suicide!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: But then, I couldn't just run away... knowing what lies sealed in the furnace...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: We're short on time. Where are we going? Who are we fighting?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: One good turn deserves another.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: I think I know where this one is going...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Haha, I'm sure General Jing Yuan must have believed wholeheartedly that you could save the Artisanship Commission from this crisis.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Means I know of may yet serve your fight, pray you in repayment aid my plight. Come! Come on, through here~
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Look, this is one of the Artisanship Commission's prototypes: the Shifting Screen.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Good thing I got the students to take it out and make a few adjustments — otherwise they'd never have managed to get out in time.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: You all saw the Jade Gate on your way in, I assume? The Shifting Screen works in the same way. It connects two spatial coordinates in ways that laymen, ahem, wouldn't understand.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Like teleportation?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Then what do you need starskiffs for?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Indeed. With limited range and energy costs aside, to every starskiff soon shall woe betide~!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: You sure about that? Even our trailblazing Space Anchors sound better.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: Thank goodness you take the time to perfect these inventions, master! If not, the Sky-Faring Commission would've become quite redundant by now.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Ordinarily I could've used this beauty to teleport you thither, but... Through earth and air the wretched branches boiled, the Shifting Screen entangled thence... encoiled!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Gongshu Liang strikes a pose and raises an eyebrow as if to say]: "keep asking."
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: I'm sure you know how to fix it.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: How observant — you would make an excellent student.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Thanks for the colorful explanation. Bye!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: H—Hold on! Have some faith in me!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Then I shall inform the general that this path is a no-go.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: H—Hold on! My young friends, don't underestimate the Artisanship Commission. The general is too far off to help us now, but I can!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: The Commission is more than a match for mother nature. Hmph! O piteous tree, who think thyself so strong, your match and more in strength to meet ere long...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Master Gongshu sets up the equipment hastily
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: This is the first thing that came to mind when the tree demon attacked.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: It's a mechanical device code-named the Luminflux Pyxis.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: I invented this weapon for the Cloud Knights. It's incredibly powerful, but...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: Let me guess... Limited range? Energy costs?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: *sigh* Every light has its shadow. But this is more than enough to deal with the tree demon.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: And then, ignite. Fire beats wood — there's no way we can lose!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Ambrosial Arbor's branches can be found blocking the path. Use the Artisanship Commission's energy conduction device to destroy all the entangled Ambrosial Arbor's coils at the same time.Ambrosial Arbor's branches can be found blocking the path.

[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Very good! The master reveals the door, but the apprentice must walk through it. You're much better than my useless students.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Wh—What's happening? Is the delve collapsing?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Phew, seems like it worked! That tree demon must be writhing in pain, hahaha.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Alright, there's no time to lose. Hurry through the Shifting Screen to the opposite side before the branches grow back.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Look, the Ambrosial Arbor's roots...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: They've encoiled the Artisanship Commission's most precious invention: the Creation Furnace!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Help me, dear young friends! Let's hack them away together! We can't let the roots punch through the furnace!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: Careful!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: It's changing...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: ...Wh—What kind of monster is this?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: ...Miraculous, it creates life at will. Such incredible power...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: It's guarding the Ambrosial Arbor's roots and the furnace.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Look at the deer's feet — there are more roots coming up!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: No matter how much damage we do, it just heals itself... not fair!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: We'll have to retreat for now. Follow me!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Ugh, no wonder the Xianzhou is so scared of the Abominations of Abundance — they're unstoppable!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Miss Tingyun, are the long-life species on the Xianzhou... all like this?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: I'm afraid this Ebon Deer was likely birthed by the Ambrosial Arbor as its guardian — it shares a close connection with the Arbor's roots. Most living creatures on the Xianzhou don't have abilities like this.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: *sigh* As long as it's there, we can't get any closer.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: I wonder... The Ebon Deer seems to heal itself instantly, but perhaps it's drawing that power from elsewhere...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Let's blast it to smithereens!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: , are you listening to Mr. Yang!?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: So if we follow the roots we can find the source of its power?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Yeah! It can't heal if we take out the source, right?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: The monster only seems to be active in the vicinity of the Arbor. Let's look around and see if we can find anything.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: I don't think we're in a position to take down this deer until we've dealt with its regenerative abilities...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: So the general asked you to head to the Alchemy Commission?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: *sigh* The Artisanship Commission had no choice but to halt operations once the tree demon appeared.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Investigate
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: It's a whole row of those gate robots! We saw one in the Divination Commission...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Gate robots...? Those are aurumatons — the Artisanship Commission created them to stand guard in various locations.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Tingyun]: Master, are these creations truly able to protect the Artisanship Commission? There's already been so much destruction — why haven't we seen any in action?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: I... Ahem! We haven't quite finished the paintwork on this batch. How can we deploy them if they're not looking their best?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: ...Young friends, I have a suggestion. Why don't we head that way?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: Any thoughts, Master Gongshu?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Hmm... When the deer revives, the surrounding roots glow brightly...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Great observation Mr. Gongshu. It's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Hehe, I'm only an artisan, after all. My skills in clash of swords shall find no sake, yet that which clasheth needeth hands to make!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: As Mr. Yang said, the deer monster is likely drawing power from somewhere in order to replenish itself. I'm certain that when the Arbor glows, we are witnessing that very process.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Maybe the root system is the key.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Let's give it a shot — nothing to lose.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Precisely! You remember how we untangled the Shifting Screen with fire?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: You're right! Those roots never grew back!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: Not only that — its reaction suggested we'd hurt it... perhaps that's our starting point.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Take hold of your weapons, young comrades! Let's raze these roots to the ground!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: See!? My theory was correct! Keep going!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Quick, there's more roots over here!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Give me a moment — I'll set up the device.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: I guess we're done...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: I suspect the Ambrosial Arbor's root system must have spread far underground. The only thing we can say with confidence is that we removed the majority of those within the bounds of the Artisanship Commission.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Let's hurry, before they've had a chance to grow back.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: So, the next step is...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Say hello to our very "deer" friend! ...Get it?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Please never do that again...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Go hoof some fun!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: I feel like I'm gonna be sick...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Deer hunting.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: ...Let's go!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Look — the roots coiled around the Creation Furnace! They've withered!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Excellent! Nothing can stop you now!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: Huh? Peaches? I am kinda hungry...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: March.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: I'm just saying! It'll be a shame if they get smashed to pieces.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][March 7th]: It's getting weak! Quick, finish it off!
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: General Jing Yuan said the Ambrosial Arbor was an unfathomable celestial blessing...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: At first glance, that deer could have been an ordinary life form, but the ability to heal such grave wounds in an instant... I think I finally understand why the Xianzhou decided to follow The Hunt in eradicating the Abundance.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: If immortal creations were left to spread their branches and roots throughout the universe, entire ecosystems would collapse...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Welt]: No wonder the people of the Xianzhou wander the universe, never settling on a planet...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: You are a man of vision, Mr. Yang. It's a shame our ancestors, the Elixir Seekers, were unable to see that hidden curse 8000 years ago...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Perhaps some of them did reject the Plagues Author's "gift." But how could an entire civilization resist the temptation of immortality?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Ironic, isn't it? The wise are buried while the fools remain immortal...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: The Xianzhou regrets being led astray by the Abundance... That's why they have decided to embark on the Path of The Hunt. Maybe it's not too late for redemption.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Thank you for your help. I realize you must continue on to the Alchemy Commission, to the Ambrosial Arbor. After witnessing what happened here, I know there will only be more danger ahead.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Go, friends, and stay vigilant. I wish you a safe journey.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Thank you for your help. Those useless students and I will take care of the rest here... If worst comes to worst, we still have the Cloud Knights.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Why do you care so much about this furnace?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: It's only a legend... though what with the Ambrosial Arbor having come back to life, I suppose it's no longer absurd...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: They say that a long time ago, when the Xianzhou Alliance was adrift in deep space, it encountered many unimaginable life forms.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Among them were abominations known as heliobi. They existed in the form of pure energy, but craved the sensations and desires of mortal flesh and blood. Sometimes they managed to infiltrate the delves of the Xianzhou in order to bewitch humans and become parasites in their bodies.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: It's said that mortals parasitized by heliobi would lose their free will imperceptibly, before gradually going berserk.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: After a prolonged struggle, the people of the Xianzhou finally managed to trap and seal the heliobi in a vessel.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: That vessel is the Creation Furnace. Our predecessors hoped that by burning the heliobi in the furnace, their energy would gradually be exhausted until they were completely destroyed.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: I don't know if there are demons in the furnace — perhaps it's all just superstition. However, from the day I started learning from my master, I've looked after the operation of the furnace.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Indeed, the flame inside has never been extinguished...
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Have you heard from the Alchemy Commission delve?
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Everything happened so quickly. My students and I were caught by surprise.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: According to the general, there are traitors in the Alchemy Commission.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: I'm not overly surprised. The Alchemy Commission's alchemists were once closer to the Arbor than anyone else on the Luofu.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: I heard the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus shut down the Alchemy Commission.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus? Now there's an old name.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: They say that when the Xianzhou Luofu was first granted the Ambrosial Arbor, the alchemists in the Alchemy Commission wielded tremendous influence. Using the power of the Arbor, they transformed mortal bodies, manipulated the weather, and even brought never-before-seen creatures into being.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: They called themselves "Saints." Unfortunately, they didn't possess any saintly powers. As soon as the Ambrosial Arbor withereed, the alchemists lost their status and were reduced to medical researchers and practitioners.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Narration]: Well then, goodbye.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: I'm sorry I'm not able to accompany you further.
[Humming Antlers, Entwined Horns][Master Gongshu]: Agh, I've always hated owing a favor. Take these with you — rewards for your tireless efforts.

[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: ...Whoa, looks like the battle here was intense...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: The master diviner must have launched the campaign while we were delayed in the Artisanship Commission.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: She must have divined it was the right time.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: Time is of the essence. The most important task for the Xianzhou Luofu is suppressing the Stellaron.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: General Jing Yuan tasked the master diviner with commanding the Cloud Knights — he would've known she'd act on the results of her divination.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I can't imagine Fu Xuan obeying orders to the word.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: Indeed. Since General Jing Yuan tasked the master diviner with commanding the Cloud Knights, he must've known she'd act on the results of her divination.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Thank goodness the general didn't make us go with the Knights... Fighting is totally different from adventuring. All these people... I—It's tough to bear.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: I'm afraid this is nothing, benefactor...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Centuries ago, an Emanator of Abundance besieged the Luofu with the aim of taking the Ambrosial Arbor. They destroyed half our delves and killed most of the Cloud Knights.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: For long-life species, such events are more like yesterday's memories than ancient history. This awful spectacle is child's play in comparison.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Hey, is that supposed to make us feel better!?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: It's hard to tell if the master diviner won or lost here.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I think she won total victory!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: I think so too! I can't see many Cloud Knights — the Xianzhou must have fought well!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Seems to me, her troops were wiped out...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Hey, whose side are you on!? I can't see many Cloud Knights — the Xianzhou must have fought well!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Let's play it safe and say it was a draw.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: ...A draw? This isn't a tournament, y'know! I can't see many Cloud Knights — the Xianzhou must have fought well!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: ...Not necessarily. There'd usually be a base with supporting forces set up after a successful engagement, but we don't see any of that.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: Let's look around and see if we can find some clues.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Be careful, . Those monsters are pretty tough...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Look, there's someone over there!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight]: Agh...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Woman]: Don't move. Let me have a look...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Here! There are still survivors here...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Woman in Healer Dressing]: Hmm? You're not the Knights... What is your purpose here? It's dangerous.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: We're reinforcements sent by the general. Where's everyone else?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Woman in Healer Dressing]: Tsk, resorting to short-life species as reinforcements... Hehe, Jing Yuan is truly running out of options.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dying Cloud Knight]: Run! She's... a Disciple of Sanctus Medicus!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Woman in Healer Dressing]: Silence. If my healing worked, you'll become one of us...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Woman in Healer Dressing]: ...and then it's not just me they'll be running from.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dying Cloud Knight]: Hurry... leave here...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dying Cloud Knight]: I can't control myself anymore...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Disciple of Sanctus Medicus]: The lives of short-life species are so fleetingly brief. Why seek death?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Disciple of Sanctus Medicus]: Why did you come to the Xianzhou? To seek immortality?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Disciple of Sanctus Medicus]: You don't have to appease Jing Yuan! The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus can provide all that you desire!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: H—Hold on! We'll find someone to help...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dying Cloud Knight]: Don't waste your time. They've "converted" me. I don't have much longer...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dying Cloud Knight]: Go... The master diviner's troops are ahead...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: He stops talking. It could be because he is exhausted, or he's waiting for you to leave him be.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: ...Let's go.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dying Cloud Knight]: ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were in hiding for so long... now they finally show their face. Did the master diviner fail to foresee this...?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Be careful, benefactors. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus worship Yaoshi the Plagues Author — the greatest enemy of the Xianzhou.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: The Alliance has been trying to root out their secret organization for millennia — it's no coincidence that they've chosen this moment to reveal themselves.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Injured Cloud Knight
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: A painful moan amidst the ravaged battlefield draws your attention.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Injured Cloud Knight]: Reignbow's blessing... You're not Disciples of Sanctus Medicus...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Stop moving around! Let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Come on, take this. It'll help with your injuries.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: You fumble through your bag to find medicine for her wounds and administer it one drop at a time.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: For a moment you are worried that medicine made for ordinary humans might not work on long-life species.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: The Cloud Knight propped herself so she could stand.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Recovered Cloud Knight]: ...Th—Thank you, all of you. I feel much better now.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Recovered Cloud Knight]: Thank goodness you're here... The garrison is up ahead, are you heading there now? I'll wait there for you.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Don't we have anything to help her?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Uhh, you wait here. I'm gonna get your comrades to help you.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Injured Cloud Knight]: Just leave me...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Don't we have anything to help her?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Uhh, you wait here. I'm gonna get your comrades to help you.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Injured Cloud Knight]: Just leave me...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: There are Sanctus Medicus sorcerers hiding out there — it's too dangerous to roam. Please wait here for the master diviner's return.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: Who goes there? Show yourselves!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: Wait, it's you...! Quickly, in here! It's dangerous outside.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: You recognize us?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: Are you not the general's guests? The master diviner prophesied your arrival — we were ordered to wait for you under any circumstances.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Fu Xuan was here?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Wait for us?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: Yes. The master diviner ordered us to remain stationed here and went to scout ahead. They're saying the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have returned — they haven't been seen for an age... The troops are anxious.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: It's good that you're here — the master diviner said the Knights weren't to move out until you arrived.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: Please wait in the camp — we'll decide on our next steps once the master diviner returns.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: That the Cloud Knights received orders not to advance is a bad sign. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus... I've heard the name before. If memory serves, they're an underground sect of the Abundance that's said to have lain dormant within the Xianzhou, plotting to overthrow the Alliance...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: The Stellaron has certainly caused Abundance-like abnormalities — is that what motivated the Disciples to come out of the shadows? No. The Knight's main force remains intact... Something must have happened — something we're not aware of. The master diviner isn't here — let's head into camp and see what we can learn from the troops here.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Good idea, why don't you take a look around, benefactors? My feet need a rest.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Have you talked with these Disciples, benefactor? What do you make of them?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Not yet...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Why would they betray the Luofu... I don't understand.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Have you talked with these Disciples, benefactor? What do you make of them?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: They're mad...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: True. But in the eyes of the Denizens of Abundance...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: ...ignoring the true nature of long-life species, suppressing the inner mara, maintaining the facade of mortal society... it's a child's game. Another breed of madness, perhaps.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I feel sorry for them...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: They brought this upon themselves. The Xianzhou Alliance forbids anyone from accessing forbidden knowledge regarding immortality.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: They should have thought about whether they were capable of paying the price when seeking the power of an Aeon.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I can understand their desire for knowledge...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Shh, that's a brave thing to say out in the open... If the Cloud Knights hear you, they won't think twice.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Hehe, it strikes me that you'd use any means to achieve your goal, benefactor.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Xianzhou natives are more afraid of immortality than they are of the days coming to an end.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: They received eternal life as they had desired, but are doomed to a fate more terrifying than death. The Abundance played a cruel trick on them.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Shocked Cloud Knight]: It was so close... so close...!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Shocked Cloud Knight]: Even seasoned soldiers — soldiers of three centuries were turned into... twisted beings! I was almost... almost...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Foxian: The Cloud Knights undergo such thorough training. How could they lose control like this?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Foxian: It's one thing for humans to be stricken with mara. But Foxians and Vidyadhara...?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Nervous Cloud Knight]: But this is different from all our previous battles! Captain, even our own comrades may become our enemies this time...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knights Captain]: Every Cloud Knight knows what they must do if their comrades become mara-struck. Don't forget your training.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Nervous Cloud Knight]: B—But this shouldn't be happening! We're still so young — we're not old enough to be stricken with mara yet...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knights Captain]: There are records of such a phenomenon in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine. Those who come into contact with the Plagues Author become mara-struck instantly... I never thought the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were real, or so close to us.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Nervous Cloud Knight]: I—I don't know how many more of our soldiers will...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Dispirited Cloud Knight]: I just felt there were... enemies all around me. I only felt hatred. I wanted to kill everything in my path...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Mumbling Cloud Knight]: Disciples of Sanctus Medicus... who would have thought our enemies would turn out to be the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Mumbling Cloud Knight]: *sigh* The master diviner must have kept it quiet to avoid alerting them.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Aurumaton Guard]: Command Talisman required for operation...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: What does it mean?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: We probably need to present it with a command for it to act.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: The Cloud Knights are guarding a prisoner who is murmuring to himself.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Deranged Disciple]: I... saw it... I saw myself become thunder... become a storm...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Deranged Disciple]: That scent in the elixir crucible... I could smell the future...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Deranged Disciple]: Mere flesh will not trap me... I am the Ebon Deer. I see the leaves and branches covering the sky. I will change again...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guarding Prisoners]: We captured a few devils from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Some of them are already mad, and this one is the maddest.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: The alchemist's eyes were unfocused, darting back and forth, as if he were looking at the two diverging ends of a path.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: The master diviner has gone ahead with the scouts. Please wait here for her.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Alarmed Cloud Knight]: Sorry, I didn't want to stop the general's distinguished guests, but just to warn you, there have been some dangerous sightings ahead. For your own safety, please stay in the areas guarded by the Cloud Knights.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: A Cloud Knight is standing next to the captive. He steps aside after you explain your identity and show him the general's order.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Alarmed Cloud Knight]: You want to ask questions? Fine, but I must be present the whole way through. This part needs to be recorded as testimony.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: ...Finally someone to talk to. These Cloud Knights are so serious, so boring, hehe...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: About Stellarons...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: That shining seed? Haha, I've seen it, so beautiful. If you gaze into it, there's a voice inside that speaks to you...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: ... do you still remember Cocolia?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: : ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: The master said we could inject new life into the Ambrosial Arbor with it. Hehe, I didn't believe it at first.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: We tried many methods, spending multiple lifetimes of short-life species, yet the Arbor showed no signs of resurrection.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: But look upon it now, hehe — "only the power of an Aeon can recreate the miracle." Yes, yes, the mighty Sanctus Medicus! The Abundance!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: About the Ambrosial Arbor...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: So you witnessed it too? The Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection, hehe... Magnificent!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: In the Befall Era, so far in the past that even long-life species cannot recall, Sanctus Medicus the Abundance gifted the Ambrosial Arbor to the Xianzhou Luofu. With that sacred tree, humanity realized many miracles: the fallow earth, the western soapberry, the altered flesh...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: But that Devilish Archer ruined everything! They twisted right and wrong and erased Sanctus Medicus's achievements... But soon... soon we will return to the glory of the Befall Era!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: You've seen the fantastic creatures that fought with us? They are only minor gifts of the Ambrosial Arbor...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Alarmed Cloud Knight]: Shut it, rambling rodent. The Cloud Knights will root all of you out soon.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: What did you do to these Cloud Knights?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: What did we do? We cured our kin! Hehe, it must hurt to be trapped in such weak flesh and blood...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Alarmed Cloud Knight]: You scum... If the order allowed I would cut you down now.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: Oh, you don't understand... a short-life species couldn't understand. Mara-struck? Bah! It's a second life gifted by Sanctus Medicus! To eliminate the self! To achieve transcendence! A life of true freedom!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: I see a desire for power in your eyes. This life is too short for you, isn't it? Hehe, I can... I can help you...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Alarmed Cloud Knight]: Don't listen, his words are poison.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Captured Disciple]: We're just having fun, sir, hehe... Without the blessing of the Abundance, you short-life species would never be able to endure the transformation.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: There is a ghastly paleness in the face of this resident Cloud Knight. As you approach him, he nods his head in salute.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: Forgive me for being brief — warfare is a dangerous business. There's no time for idle chat.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: How's the situation?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: We took over this place a few hours ago under the master diviner's command. It was only afterwards that we learned our enemies were none other than the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus — those who worship the Plagues Author.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: Everything was going as planned. The sorcerers of the Disciples and the fantastic creatures they commanded were no match for us.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: ...Then, after a while, our comrades suddenly started to slaughter one another...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: They became mara-struck...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: Curse it! What Sanctus Medicus sorcery did they use on us!?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Those monsters...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: Yes, among the Sanctus Medicus monsters... there were our comrades.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: There's a wounded warrior that didn't make it back to his unit...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: Thanks for your intel. I'll dispatch someone immediately.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: The greatest fear of the Xianzhou people is succumbing to our mara-struck form around others. To do so means that we have given up on being human, lost to the abomination sleeping in our immortal blood... and violated the Reignbow's admonishments.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: What the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus did are despicable acts that every Alliance resident detests!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: On-Duty Cloud Knight: ...I swear to the Arbiter that I will avenge my comrades.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: When the Master Diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times... It's making me a little nervous.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: , are you ready?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Ready.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Enter the Crossroads of Fate...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Please note that your choice will bring about an irreversible outcome. By continuing forward, the following missions will permanently disappear as the story progresses.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Venom Brews, Immortality Looms
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Sinners Misled, Credence Falsified
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: If you choose to abandon a mission, its rewards will permanently disappear and cannot be obtained again.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Not yet...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Cloud Knight Guard]: Master diviner! You're back!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I have kept you waiting, but the deceit of the Disciples is laid bare to me now.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: You kept us waiting alright.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Hmph, I was merely being courteous — according to my divination you've hardly been here long.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Why didn't you tell us about the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus earlier?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Apologies. To avoid dissemination of intelligence, the general and I kept the involvement of the Disciples to ourselves.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: It is a clandestine organization that seeks to overthrow the Alliance. Before the Stellaron disaster, the Disciples had remained veiled in shadow for years. Their emergence reflects their intricate connection to this calamity.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Please tell us the whole truth this time...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Apologies. To avoid dissemination of intelligence, the general and I kept the involvement of the Disciples to ourselves.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: It is a clandestine organization that seeks to overthrow the Alliance. Before the Stellaron disaster, the Disciples had remained veiled in shadow for years. Their emergence reflects their intricate connection to this calamity.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: The conflict is difficult, master diviner, but you have you led your forces from the front lines and beyond in pursuit of the enemy. Admirable work.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Hardly! A diviner must acquire first-hand knowledge in order to calculate the future. Collecting intelligence in this way assists me in achieving the right answer...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Wait... what's all this about a difficult conflict? The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have been scheming for a long time, but our army is in no way inferior. How can things be so difficult?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Is this a segue into us joining the fray?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Sharp as always.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: *sigh* I knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner — now we're predicting the future...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Just ask for our help already...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: It would seem you came prepared.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: *sigh* The first time we met Madam Yukong she said something like: "This is a Xianzhou affair and there's no need for the Express to get involved..."
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: ...and now here we are running around doing everything. Even the IPC takes it easier on us.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Lemme guess, what are we up to this time? Could it be... heading to the front lines? Leading the Cloud Knight charge?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Well try this on for size — nope! I can't stand anymore of this fighting, so there!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: *sigh* Who said you'd be heading to the battlefield...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: W—We're not?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Jing Yuan's orders. He said that the value of unexpected guests lies in the unexpected. The Cloud Knights' assault was to demonstrate our power to the enemy head-on... now it is time for the unexpected.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Please, come with me.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: After receiving the Ambrosial Arbor, the Alchemy Commission was once the Luofu's most vital commission.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: After all, it was they who changed the Xianzhou natives into long-life species... They also developed many incredible technologies from the tree itself.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: But in the end, the alchemists grew discontented and began to obsess over the manipulation of life. Research into the Arbor poisoned their minds... the more they pursued it, the more they longed for it.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: "Morning bells chime in a dream, evening mist gathers around me"...Do you see that?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: What huge elixir crucibles. There's still smoke coming out of them.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: This is where the alchemists practiced the way of immortality in ancient times. They erected elixir crucibles here to absorb the power of the Arbor, turning fantasy into reality. Since the smoke from the crucibles never ceases, this place was named Evemist Mansion.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: An elegant name, but as far as the art of war is concerned, it's a deathtrap. As long as the crucibles are lit and the smoke continues to linger, we cannot get any closer.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: This is why the Cloud Knights lost control and became mara-struck?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Indeed. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus infused the smoke that permeates this delve with medicinal pellets that elicit mara.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Unless the Cloud Knights were able to march with their breath held, they would be doomed to fall into disarray. Moreover, no one could know whether their comrade was about to be stricken with mara. Is there anything better than fear for destroying the morale of an army?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: The Cloud Knights first assault was just a cover. You're using the main army to attract the enemy's attention, while we douse the elixir crucibles and stop the smoke.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus renounced their century of secrecy and chose to reveal themselves, meaning they feel confident of victory... but no matter how well-prepared they may be, their focus has always been the Cloud Knights. They are completely unaware of your existence and capacity, and in short — cannot be prepared against you.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: This smoke can't affect us?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Indeed. This demonic vapor is a weapon targeted against the Cloud Knights.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: The Ambrosial Arbor is taboo for the Luofu, and the Xianzhou Alliance has always been fiercely independent. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus could never have guessed that the general would seek outside help — they won't be prepared against short-life species.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Why not get the Foxians and Vidyadhara to try?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: You misunderstand the nature of the mara-struck condition — it is not a curse unique to humankind. Foxians don't usually succumb to it because their lifespan is not eternal, yet they are still a long-life species. The Vidyadhara rely on molting to discard the old world. All long-life species are equal in the face of mara...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: However, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus could never have guessed that the general would seek outside help — they won't be prepared against short-life species.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: Is this what General Jing Yuan meant by unexpected guests?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I wouldn't hazard a guess. All I can say is that the predictions of the Stellaron Hunters were more accurate than mine. The future that Kafka seeks is becoming reality... one step at a time.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I don't want to act according to their predictions.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I do not wish to be their puppet, either. In any case, we do not walk alone and unhindered on our paths. Our choices define us and influence others.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: This is the only way...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Rather, only this way leads to the known best result. If we can afford to choose, then none would choose to leap off a cliff.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Besides, this is not my decision alone...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: The duty of the master diviner is to bring luck and avoid misfortune. I don't want my choice to plunge the Luofu into a terrible future.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: To return to the matter at hand, only you can douse the elixir crucibles without being harmed by them. What say you?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Fine. I didn't hear a "please," but seeing as we do kinda have superpowers around here... , Mr. Yang, what do you think?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I will come at once when the smoke dissipates — you won't be left to fend for yourselves.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: *coughing* What? It's not too late to practice holding my breath...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: You seem quite alright...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: We're still far from the elixir crucibles. I'm no healer, but I do know that dosage is important in the application of poisons...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Hmph, even so... Okay I admit it — I'm terrified! I'm still young! I don't wanna become mara-struck so soon!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Then you'd better return to the home front.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Out of the question! Jing Yuan gave me authority over the Cloud Knights. If I can't even stand on the front lines, then how can I succeed him as general? *cough* How can I win the hearts of the people!?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: But if your condition worsens...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: My fortune is fluctuating between the marsh and heaven trigrams — I can avert disaster by being decisive. So stop talking to me and distracting me!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I'll focus on keeping my sanity. The rest is up to you.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Is that smoke really safe though?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Do you not trust me?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: *coughing* ...If I told you I wasn't certain, would you turn back on the spot?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: You don't have the slightest clue, do you?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Nonsense! I'm very certain! One-hundred percent!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Do a divination.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: No need. Aside from divinations and calculations, my instincts are accurate too!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: ...Though I'm sure a little reassurance wouldn't hurt. You don't know what being mara-struck actually means, do you?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: The healers believe that the mara-struck condition is related to memories. Unsurprisingly, long-life species have long lifespans, but there is a limit to the brain's capacity.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: After centuries and millennia, a long-life species' emotional threshold becomes higher and higher. Simultaneously, their memories fade and become dull under the erosion of time, leaving behind only the most extreme and vivid recollections, which are almost guaranteed to be memories full of anguish and regret...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Do you understand now? The fate of all long-life species is to no longer feel joy and happiness, left only with hatred and regret etched into the heart. Under such extreme conditions, a person's ego starts to crumble... and that is the beginning of the mara-struck condition.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Short-life species don't need to worry about this. Feel better?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Phew, I do — I never had memories to begin with.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: ...No, you still don't understand. The condition isn't caused by memories, but by the emotional threshold having been... Never mind. You can regard it as a memory issue.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: How large are the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus's forces?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Only a handful of converted alchemists and healers. They can drive fantastic creatures into battle and strengthen their bodies with medicinal pellets... but they are no match for the Cloud Knights. That's why they decided to spread this demonic vapor.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: There is a gulf in strength between us, yet still they emerged into the open and rebelled. Something isn't right. They must be waiting for some shift in fortune...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: I'll leave you to it.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I will come at once when the crucibles are doused and the smoke dissipates.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: *sigh* I feel like... even though long-life species get to live forever...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: ...they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Wait, Miss Tingyun, why are you still here!? You're too close to the crucible!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Thank you for the concern, but I'm fine~ The general commanded me to stay with you — I dare not go against military orders.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: Your life is more important, Miss Tingyun. Go back, we can explain to the general.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Hehe, there's really no need — I've spent my years traveling the universe! Not to mention, I'm younger and stronger than I look.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Even you benefactors have probably lived longer than me.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Investigate
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: The crucible gradually stops shaking, and the smoke slowly ceases to pour out.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Seems like the smoke is getting thinner...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: Not thin enough. We need to hurry.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Investigate
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: The crucible starts to shake, and smoke emits out of the cold elixir crucible.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: T—Turn it off! , why did you turn it on!?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Investigate
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: The talismans on the elixir cauldron are dark and inactive. The elixir crucible lies silent.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Curiously, you put your hand on an ancient engraving. The crucible begins to shake and smoke rises up towards the sky.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Are you doing this on purpose!?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Wait, we still haven't doused the burners!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Yay, we did it! Can't see the smoke anymore.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: E—Excellent. I'll lead my troops to the rendezvous.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: So you succeeded in dousing the elixir cauldrons...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: Unimportant. The inevitable is already upon us.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Dan Shu... it's you.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: I have met you before in my capacity as chief alchemist, master diviner... You don't seem surprised.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Indeed. The general and I knew that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus must be hiding in the Alchemy Commission. However, without evidence, we couldn't bring charges before the commissions. We had to wait for you to show yourselves...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: ...and now, your charges are many. Drawing Stellaron spirits into the Xianzhou, resurrecting the Ambrosial Arbor, striking down our people with mara... The Ten-Lords Commission will address these transgressions during your reckoning.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: Crimes? If I am guilty, then all of our Xianzhou ancestors are also guilty! They were the ones who accepted the blessings of the Abundance and turned their descendants into long-life species...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are only walking on the road our ancestors once took. How is it a crime to seek ascendance?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: In days of old, the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor enveloped the Xianzhou Luofu like a living creature. We controlled the stellar seas and none could stand in our way. Everyone could become a celestial and shift form at will. Divine miracles descended onto all nine Xianzhou ships. What a glorious time that was...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: How far the Xianzhou has fallen! We consent to be commanded by the Devilish Archer, suffer continuously at the hands of the Denizens of Abundance, and the Ten-Lords Commission even forces us to give up our immortality...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: How pitiful! I do not blame you for your ignorance — we were not born in the era when the Ambrosial Arbor first descended, nor did we witness its miracles. But now we now have an opportunity to restore the ancient laws...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Hmph... Forgive me for thinking you might have harbored some profound enlightment. Yours is the same old talk of those who seek power... and give up on their humanity.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Our Xianzhou ancestors fought side by side with the Arbiter, laid waste to the Arbor, and established the Ten-Lords Commission to lay down the lines between life and death... In doing so, we enshrined our future as human beings.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Celestials? There are no celestials on the Xianzhou. The "divine miracles" of the Abundance, the manipulation of life and death... Your deeds are nothing but evil!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: I have nothing to say to you, Master diviner — you have already made your decision. You have discarded power... a most foolish choice.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: Master Diviner, allow me to show you what the celestials were capable of.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: Merciful Medicus, hear my call!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: Why... why? She said...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: The Ambrosial Arbor's descent... will bring us undying bodies...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: The one who gave us the Stellaron... said that...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: Phantylia... the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have fulfilled our promise...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus]: You, Lord Ravager, must do the same... Now! Quickly!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Tsk, tsk, little pawn, must you force me to intervene directly? I'm loath to flout my philosophy of destruction.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: Never mind. It would seem the time has come for other means of dismantling the Xianzhou from within...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: What a shame...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: It would've been nice to observe for a little longer...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun]: You received the gift of Abundance...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Tingyun?]: ...surely you can withstand the blessing...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][???]: ...of Destruction.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Miss Tingyun!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][???]: Benefactors...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][???]: ...allow me to reintroduce myself...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][???]: I am Lord Ravager Phantylia.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Phantylia]: I have come with a single purpose: to set in motion the self-destruction of the Xianzhou!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Miss Tingyun... is a Lord Ravager of the Antimatter Legion!? But— How can that be?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Keep calm, all of you! This is a formidable enemy — we have to stay together!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Phantylia]: You are fortunate that Zephyro and Celenova never set their gaze upon the Xianzhou.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Phantylia]: They have no qualms about dealing out destruction by their own hand...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Phantylia]: But since that stubborn general of yours has forced me to take center stage, I'll make sure I steal the show.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Phantylia]: Haha... My apologies for leaving so soon, but I have an appointment to keep. I'm sure my friends here will be happy to entertain you...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: W—Wait, hold on a second — are you really saying that Miss Tingyun was a member of the Antimatter Legion all along?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: And what was that fire that came out of her? And her body — where did it go?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: Mr. Yang, you're smart. What happened just now!?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Mr. Yang
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: The flame we witnessed claimed to be Lord Ravager Phantylia — a name I've heard other Nameless speak of in the past.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: She's one of seven Lord Ravagers who serve Nanook... and finds pleasure in witnessing the self-destruction of mortals. She's led countless souls down a dark and hopeless path.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: ...Meaning that Tingyun had long since fallen under the Lord Ravager's influence?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: I don't believe so. Phantylia revels in watching a corrupted mind eating away its host from inside out, until the obliteration of both is achieved.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: But there was no indication that Tingyun had been misguided or manipulated... It's possible that the Tingyun we knew wasn't her true self, but an image Phantylia devised to serve her own purposes.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: That is to say, Tingyun...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: ...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: You're saying that the real Tingyun is still...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: I'm sorry March, I can't say with any certainty where the real Tingyun may be, or at what point she was replaced by the impostor. Without knowing where the body vanished to, it'll be tough to get an answer.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: At this point, it's all just conjecture and hope. But if that body belonged to the real Tingyun, it does raise the question of why Phantylia would go to such lengths to destroy any evidence of her. Wouldn't it be more in line with her destructive nature to leave Tingyun's remains behind as a display of power?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Welt]: I believe this to be Phantylia's goal — to sow seeds of doubt among us and ensnare us in a malevolent trap.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: It's clear that the sudden resurgence of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus is all connected to the Lord Ravager. Pretending to be a Xianzhou citizen, planting a Stellaron on the Luofu — all part of her plan to bring about our self-destruction.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Phantylia is aiming for the Ambrosial Arbor! If she succeeds, the Luofu will be deprived of its roots, making its destruction all too easy. We must stop her!
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: We need to take a starskiff to Scalegorge Waterscape — the Ambrosial Arbor can be sealed from that delve.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: , let's make haste.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: That impostor had the audacity to carry out her nefarious plans right under our noses... How utterly despicable.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: What worries me more is... just how many more Antimatter saboteurs are at large?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: About Tingyun...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][March 7th]: It all happened so suddenly... but looking back, I think Mr. Yang was right. Tingyun was behaving strangely — she was fascinated with the Abundance's creations.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Since she was an amicassador dispatched by the Sky-Faring Commission, it's evident that there must indeed be a person with her name in the Commission. We'll have to let the Cloud Knights get to the bottom of what happened to the real Tingyun.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: As for the "Tingyun" who accompanied us all that way, it's like what Mr. Yang said — her appearance was designed to sow seeds of doubt among us... we cannot allow ourselves to fall into her trap.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: About Scalegorge Waterscape...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: It is a delve governed by the Vidyadhara — supposedly an ancient oceanic region transferred from the Vidyadhara home planet.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: After the Ambrosial Arbor was broken in two during the war, its roots were left gnarled and broken... yet it never died.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: The Alliance decided to seal the Arbor within Scalegorge Waterscape, entrust it to the high elders of the Vidyadhara, and rely on the power of Long's Scions to constrain it.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: It has been so long — no one knows whether the seal remains... Even if it does, I doubt it will hinder that spectral Lord Ravager.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Where is Jing Yuan?
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: I've reported the current situation to the Seat of Divine Foresight.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: He made no further contact after we communicated at the Matrix of Prescience. He said he had "important matters to personally attend to."
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: The situation stands on the edge of a precipice. We must trust in the general...
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Narration]: Time is of the essence. Let's go.
[Desolate Depths of Despair][Fu Xuan]: Why are we still here? Things will change if we tarry too long.

[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: A little while ago...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Uh, this is...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: The Alchemy Commission.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: The delve bordering Scalegorge Waterscape.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Huh? You're pretty familiar with this place.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Yep, it's the Alchemy Commission. No wonder we were getting those military broadcasts on the way over — something about the Cloud Knights gathering here, right? They're probably coming to fix the Stellaron problem.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: *sigh* It's been such a long journey, but now we're finally gonna meet some Cloud Knights! I'll be back with my unit!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: I didn't lie to you, right? I told you I'd bring you somewhere safe, and I did! Though... we did take a bit of a detour...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: Before I arrived in Starskiff Haven, I had a diviner read my fortune for the journey ahead. He told me not to be concerned with the destination, but to seize my chances and travel with the current to reap the greatest harvest.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: ...Meaning?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: Meaning thank you, Miss Sushang.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Oh... okay. Well, I'm gonna go report to the nearest captain.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: You guys can hang around here, but don't run off too far — there'll be Cloud Knights coming to escort you back soon. Bye for now!

[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: What's up?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: I need to go.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Go? Go where? The Luofu is under lockdown — the Cloud Knights' operation isn't over yet.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Relax. When the fight is over, I'll personally escort you and Mr. Luocha home~
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Nothing...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Sushang]: Don't worry. Once the fight is over, I'll personally escort you and Mr. Luocha home~
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: You haven't been back home for a long time, have you Master Dan Heng?

[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: As home draws nearer, so our feelings grow stronger. I can see it in your eyes.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: Do you want to leave? Then do it now.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: The Cloud Knights will soon check our identities. I have somewhere else to be — I've tarried here too long.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...Where are you going?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Luocha]: I'm a traveling merchant. I have one more deal to see through.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Foxian: I heard that starskiff connections are being reinstated. The people stranded at the Alchemy Commission should all be able to leave soon.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Deranged Disciple]: The master was defeated? No... N—No that cannot be!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Excited Cloud Knight]: Good news from the front lines! The Disciples over at Evemist Mansion have been defeated.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus started a rebellion in the Alchemy Commission — the Cloud Knights have the area locked down. It's not safe, please remain here for now.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: We will send someone to escort you back once the operation is over.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Disciples of Sanctus Medicus?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: Lunatics — all of them. You saw the Ambrosial Arbor, I assume? I heard that's the work of those sorcerers. Still, I can't say too much — military secrets.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: and the others get drawn into all this...?)
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Have you seen any outworlders?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: You must be talking about the general's guests. Are they your friends?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: What a coincidence — they left with the master diviner not long ago. It's all thanks to their courageous work that the Knights don't have to worry about the poison in Evemist Mansion.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: I received the good news from the front lines. They'll probably be back soon.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Cloud Knights Captain]: Strange, you seem oddly familiar to me... Never mind, too many misfortunes recently — I can hardly think straight.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Mumbling Cloud Knight]: Those Travelers defeated the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus... Won't that make us seem... incompetent?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Mumbling Cloud Knight]: I—I need to find a way to make this report sound more... impressive.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Rejuvenated Cloud Knight]: Thanks to those heroes I managed to pull through. Could those guests of the general be the Galaxy Rangers of old?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Captured Disciple]: The master must have failed to summon the protection of Sanctus Medicus — her will must have wavered.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Captured Disciple]: Just you wait — I'll show you the blessing of Sanctus Medicus.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: What a huge cauldron.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: This aureate cauldron is driven by the cloudhymn magic of our people — the Vidyadhara. It drinks the water of the ancient sea like a whale swallows the tide, and refines it into medicinal pellets...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: All the elixir crucibles that the Vidyadhara helped to construct contain cloudhymn magic. You should take this chance to learn more, young master...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: Huh? But I don't need any sort of device to help me command water, what more is there to learn?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: You are indeed the chosen one, with endless potential... yet cloudhymn magic is just the beginning.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: A Vidyadhara Mirage Echo... Have these shadows of the past yet to disperse?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: These memories...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: No. They have nothing to do with me anymore.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Vidyadhara Mirage Echo
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: They say that you are Long's power incarnate. Is that true?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: Hmph...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: Aargh... Long...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I was exiled from the Xianzhou. I am no longer one of the Scions of Permanence.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: I doubt I will be here to see you take charge...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: No need to feel aggrieved. Vidyadhara go through cycles of life and death, existing forever in this world.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: By the time you are the high elder, my hatching rebirth will be complete and I will be a child once again. Please take care of me.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: This surging power... It's you... You've returned, High Elder.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Narration]: Vidyadhara Mirage Echo
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: Something terrible is happening in Scalegorge Waterscape. Please don't go any further... Your enemies... Your enemies are waiting for you.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I'm sorry, I cannot linger here. My friends have left — I must find them.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: You didn't heed us then, and won't heed us now... as headstrong as you always were.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Past Echo]: It seems you already made your decision. There is a vessel bound for Scalegorge Waterscape located ahead.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: He's here.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Kafka]: Mm, right on time.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: ...That feeling, Kafka — it's welling up within me. That feeling! I—It's...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Kafka]: Don't resist. Let the mara strike you...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: You're here.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: *laughing in madness* It's time to pay the price! It's time!!!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: You think changing form will help you escape!? Escape...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I have told you and that woman many times... I am Dan Heng.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I have nothing to do with your past.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Dan Heng... You think another name and face can blot out the sin of your past? You... You didn't even experience death...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: I will force this suffering upon you, "Dan Heng." You will know the pain of death!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][???]: Hmph, not on my watch.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: You're not murdering anyone today, fugitive. You're coming with me.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Jing Yuan's lapdog... Did the general not teach you to choose your battles wisely...?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: Hey, move back. Things are about to... Huh?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: You... you look so familiar...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: Look out!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Quit hiding.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Your true self...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: reveal it!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: Stop!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: You...!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: I have news for you, boy...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Behind you is none other...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: ...than the traitor of the Xianzhou!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: A criminal, forever banished!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: The High Elder of the Vidyadhara...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Imbibitor Lunae
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: You really thought the Stellaron Hunters were the only ones to infiltrate the Xianzhou?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: In that case... I'll bring both of you to justice!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: I've heard of you, Imbibitor Lunae...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: First it was the Stellaron Hunters, now an exiled criminal has infiltrated the Xianzhou...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...I have no interest in stoking conflict. I came to ensure the safety of my friends.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: Save your excuses for the Shackling Prison.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: Out of the way!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Hahaha, better, but I'm afraid you won't be seeing your friends.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: They're caught in their own bitter struggle.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: Silence! You're not getting away either!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: ...Is that so? Let's heat things up then. Kafka!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Kafka]: Bladie, listen to me: Unleash the mara.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: ... So it begins.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: Surrender!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: What's wrong, afraid to hurt the boy?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: You two just won't give up...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: I only have one choice...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: ...So familiar.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Did she teach you?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Then you deserve no mercy!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: 
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: *long sigh* I didn't wish to harm anyone... But there's no other way. Forgive me.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: This... isn't over...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Kafka]: All of you, listen to me — stop.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Kafka]: Well, Bladie? Are you satisfied?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: ...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: ...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Hmph.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...What did you do?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Kafka]: I'm just clearing the stage for the grand entrance — can't have you three misbehaving in front of the Luofu's hotshot general.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Haha.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: Jing Yuan...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: General!
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Many years have passed since the two of you departed the Xianzhou, and yet the circumstances of your return appear to be equally unhappy. If you still thought of me as a friend, you should've forewarned me.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Blade]: My task is complete.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Mm, that it is.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Thank you for assisting the Xianzhou in this small matter. Take this person away — I will pretend I didn't see anything this time.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Yanqing]: General!? I...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Now is not the time.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: It has been a long time... old friend.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I'm not him.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Mm... I'm sorry.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: You cannot leave yet — your Astral Express friends are waiting for you in Scalegorge Waterscape. Shall we go and see them together?
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Lunarescent Depths — a realm of singular beauty. Scalegorge Waterscape is the same as when I last laid eyes on it... and here we stand so different from one another. The flesh of long-life species may be immortal, but the constant of heaven and earth eludes them.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: You know the Vidyadhara hatching rebirth cycle, general. The waters of the ancient sea have cleansed Dan Feng of his past sin. The person that once stood here alongside you is no more.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I am Dan Heng. Whether Dan Feng was hero or villain has nothing to do with me. I bore his punishment, accepted my eternal banishment without complaint... but do not let his shadow cloud your estimation of me, general.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: *sigh* Raising old nets only darkens the water — an exercise in unhappiness. Perhaps it is your visage, the horns on your head, or the unmistakable air of the high elder that makes the separation nigh impossible for me.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: ...I already told you—
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: You did... but to what effect? If words alone were enough to change the heart, this world would be without quarrel. If you wish to rid me of the illusion of Dan Feng, you must do something for me.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Before I can let Dan Feng die and revoke your banishment edict, I need him to do me one final favor. I can guarantee you that when it is done, you will no longer walk in anyone's shadow aboard the Luofu.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Dan Heng]: I may not be capable of the things that Dan Feng was capable of.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: You must do it, or my promise will count for naught. If you wish to blame someone, blame your previous incarnation. Had he not committed that terrible sin — had the power of dragon transmutation been passed on intact — I would have no need to compel you.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: It is as I said: here we stand so different from one another. Dan Feng is no more — now there is only Dan Heng. But I...
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: I am the general of the Luofu. There are things that I wish I did not have to do, and yet I must.
[Dragon Mislay, Dreams Astray][Jing Yuan]: Haha, let us talk of happier tidings. The friends you made on the Express are here. Do you wish to see them?

[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Dan Heng]: , March, Mr. Yang... You brought them here!?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Yes, they are waiting in the Dragonvista Rain Hall.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Go, your friends are waiting for you.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Investigate
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: I have been keeping careful watch against the Abominations of Abundance, the Stellaron Hunters, and the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus... but I never anticipated the Antimatter Legion.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: The Hunt is far from over, yet all the while we find ourselves at war with other evil spirits... Hmph, from this battle onward, the Alliance must fight the Legion to our dying breath, even if it means the end of the Luofu.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Investigate
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Our intelligence tells us that the Legion are a mad and destructive war machine, yet they never took up arms against the Alliance. The armies of the Seven Ravagers all have their own means of destruction — they are not to be taken lightly.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Lord Ravager Phantylia favors internal collapse, which is why she masterminded the Stellaron crisis and urged the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus out of the shadows. Now that her plot has been laid bare she has no choice but to retreat... and yet that hardly suits her philosophy of destruction. There must be something more...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Vidyadhara Mirage Echo
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Young Voice]: Her hatching rebirth is complete... she left me all alone.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Young Voice]: Still, I wait for the day of my rebirth... endless waiting...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Investigate
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Do you know something? When Dan Feng committed his great crime, the Ten-Lords Commission advocated strongly for him to be destroyed. The Vidyadhara, on the other hand, were split evenly in their favor and disfavor of the motion. Haha, the dragon transmutation inheritance was not intact, after all. The senior Vidyadhara hated you, yet did not dare to kill you.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: The Vidyadhara were under great pressure. In order to placate the Ten-Lords and Sky-Faring Commissions, they performed an exuviation charm on Dan Feng against his will. Still, they ensured that the charm contained a flaw, thinking that this would fool the Ten-Lords Commission. Hmph, the senior Vidyadhara were sure of their scheme, but you cannot hide fire with paper.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Vidyadhara Mirage Echo
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Old Voice]: As recorded in the ancient texts, this body of water was brought by my people from our home world — it formed part of the Roiling Deep. It is as pure here as it was there.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Old Voice]: Our dragon ancestors nurtured us with the water of life and bestowed us with the permanence of the Vidyadhara.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Vidyadhara Mirage Echo
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Female Voice]: Waters of the ancient sea, cleanse me, waters of the ancient sea, protect me...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Female Voice]: This world's good karma is settled. This life's misfortune is erased.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Look, your friends are taking the fight to the Legion as we speak...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Dan Heng]: We need to help them, let's go.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: Jing Yuan! Where have you been!?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Haha, forgive my late arrival, Lady Fu — we are indebted to you and your forces. The Seat of Divine Foresight relayed the battle reports to me. As for Phantylia's plan...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: The Ambrosial Arbor — that's her focus.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: Lord Ravager Phantylia's strategy was to create civil strife — then let it consume the Xianzhou from within. She wanted to use the Arbor to disseminate the power of the Plagues Author... and turn the Luofu into a hell of undying abominations.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Mm, that is clear to me now. Friends of the Astral Express, I have brought someone with me whom I think you'll be eager to see.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Huh? I—Is that... Dan Heng!? You...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Y—You are Dan Heng, right? What's with the horns...?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Dan Heng]: It's a long story, March. It's me.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: So... you do have secret strength!?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Let us save such reminiscence for later, shall we?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: My astral guests, when you first appeared on the Luofu, your stated aim was the resolution of the Stellaron crisis. I was concerned that the Stellaron Hunters harbored ulterior motives and refused your offer. I see now that I was overly anxious.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Nevertheless, it is true that the motives of the Stellaron Hunters were not what they appeared, haha. In order that the Express and the Xianzhou fight side by side, Kafka lured you here and broadened the scope of the crisis... In doing so, she succeeded in making clear that your sincerity is beyond doubt. The Luofu is in your debt, and I have no right to seek further assistance from you.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: However, as Lady Fu has explained, the appearance of Phantylia means that the situation is far from under our control. As general of the Luofu, it would be foolish of me not to ask Dan Heng and the rest of you for your strength at this critical moment.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: Even if the crisis on the Luofu had nothing to do with the Stellaron, I would be willing to help... but I can't speak for the other members of my crew.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: Explore, understand, establish, and connect... As the crew of the Express, that's the trailblaze creed we follow. Still, when the journey gets tough, those words can feel far-off.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: Fear, risk, enemies, and death are the obstacles we face in pursuit of the creed. That's why the Nameless who are able to stay the course number few indeed.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: Whether our destination lies before us or behind us, the decision is ours to make. Here, as on the Express, every vote counts.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Dan Heng...?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Thank you, Dan Heng.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Dan Heng]: ...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: The choice is yours, Dan Heng.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Dan Heng]: How am I still one of the Nameless? I stand here at the mercy of others without true freedom to speak...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Dan Heng]: ...but as a descendant of the Vidyadhara, I will fulfill my duty to the Luofu.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Great! Everyone's just as heroic as when they arrived. So, what's the master plan, general?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: There is no master plan, only a bet... a bet on the senior Vidyadhara's incomplete exuviation charm, and on Dan Heng's ability to access the memories of the high elder...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: High elder?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: When the Reignbow Arbiter severed the Ambrosial Arbor, remnants of the curse of the Plagues Author lingered. In order to make the stemming of those remnants a possibility, the Luofu invoked the power of the Scions of Permanence.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Under the direction of the high elder, the Vidyadhara guided the waters of the ancient sea to flood the Scalegorge Waterscape delve and contain the Arbor. To commemorate this magnificent feat and sacrifice, the Alliance erected the Dragonvista Rain Monument — a Vidyadhara statue.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: It looks so much like Dan Heng... I wonder if...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: The statue... is that...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: ...Dan Heng's brother!?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Ha, I see why you might think so. These events occurred a long time ago, yet successive generations of high elders have not differed greatly in their appearance... that is, until the current generation. The most recent successor did not inherit the same level of power, and their appearance is that of a child.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Do you understand, Dan Heng? Since Dan Feng perished, the Luofu Vidyadhara have no longer had an individual capable of performing such feats. But you, who once kept watch over the Arbor, should be able to open a way through to that great tree.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: What happens next, is in your hands.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: You scared the heck outta me! For a second I thought you'd annoyed the general — it seemed like you were his prisoner. There I was thinking up a plan to kidnap you, and it turns out the two of you are old buddies!
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Soooo what made you suddenly decide to come down from the Express?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: I was worried for your safety.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Aww, how sweet! Buuuut , Mr. Yang, and I have been holding our own — we're pretty much Xianzhou heroes at this point.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: ...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Okay, okay, I won't push you — everyone has their secrets. Besides, given the circumstances, my curiosity can wait.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Anyway, it's great to have you with us, Dan Heng!
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Y'know, the more I look at this statue, the less "Dan-Hengy" it gets...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][March 7th]: Still, it's got the same stony expression, haha.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Has coming here triggered your memory?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Jing Yuan]: Release your full potential — the power you carry is the key to opening a way through to the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: Imbibitor Lunae's reincarnation... Dan Heng, correct? I have heard your name before.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: How can that be, my name was erased...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Why would the names of the banished be recorded?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: Your name was only erased from the public eye. But as the master diviner, I know — and should know — all the records of years gone by... Such archives are of great importance in times of need.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: I was not born in the heroic and extraordinary era of the High-Cloud Quintet. To have seen those legends with my own eyes...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Go on...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: Your appearance closely matches the depiction in the annals... Does Vidyadhara reincarnation really entail a complete transformation — a new life?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: Perhaps it is a little inappropriate of me to pry into the secrets of the Vidyadhara...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Fu Xuan]: ...but your appearance closely matches the depiction in the annals... Does Vidyadhara reincarnation really entail a complete transformation — a new life?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: I knew you'd come. When we first mentioned the Xianzhou, there was a sad look in your eyes.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: They may have banished you, but the Luofu is still your home.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Thanks for all your help along the way...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: I'm sorry I never spoke up...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: You're a member of the Express Crew, Dan Heng. Let's settle this matter as soon as possible — our journey doesn't end here.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Welt]: *sigh* Those two haven't exactly been on their best behavior... It would've been good to have you here earlier.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: , optional, first interaction)
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: looks at you, as you both become silent.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: Is there nothing you'd like to ask?
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: ...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: shakes  head.  doesn't want to speak. Nobody can get  to open up.
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Narration]: : ...
[Oblation Obtained, Order Ordained][Cloud Knight]: The general still has important matters to discuss with you. Please remain here.

[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Fu Xuan]: The annals mention that Scalegorge Waterscape was once the location of Dragon Palace. Small wonder — look at all these submerged structures...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: I was fortunate enough to be here during The Shuhu Upheaval period — I witnessed this place in its prime. An age past — the palace was left in ruins, and the Vidyadhara used their sacred homeland to imprison the Arbor. The Luofu and the Xianzhou are greatly indebted to them.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Lady Fu.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Fu Xuan]: Here, general.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Remain here — lead the Cloud Knights in defense of this passage. We must prevent further incidents.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Fu Xuan]: Jing Yuan... General, are you planning to face Phantylia alone?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: I wouldn't say so, I'll be counting on a few friends for support.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Cloud Knight Soldier]: General! Don't cast us aside! We're willing to go with you!
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Yes, General! We may not be the mightiest force, but it's our duty as Cloud Knights to protect the Xianzhou — how can we let outworlders face the danger while we stay behind the lines!? With your permission, sir, allow me to lead the way.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: I understand your sentiment, soldiers...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: ...but the adversary ahead of us is not an Abomination of Abundance. They are a Lord Ravager of the Antimatter Legion. Crossing this line will bring you into the conflict between the Reignbow Arbiter and the Ruin Author...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: You have a more important duty. Cloud Knights, attention!
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: After I enter the Ambrosial Arbor, and if the seawater returns to its original state, you must withdraw immediately and seal off the delve once more. The Master Diviner will lead you.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Yes, general!
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Lady Fu, if I am unable to return, I entrust you with the important task of relaying the full account to the other Xianzhou ships.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Fu Xuan]: ...I trust you will be here to re-issue the order in person... but whatever the outcome, I will do as you command and honor the mission.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Ha, spoken like a true general.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Phew, these steps are so apart. Gotta find a way down...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Old Voice]: Use Scalegorge Waterscape to seal the Arbor? Treason! Blasphemy!
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Old Voice]: You've lost your senses! You think this will gain the trust of the Xianzhou natives? Those who are not of our kind can never be of our mind!
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Voice of High Elder]: I understand your misgivings, but my decision is made. That is the course we must take.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Old Voice]: I... very well. In that case, I will report you to the Preceptors and have you stripped of the name and power of the high elder.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: This must be... the first high elder that accepted the mission to quell the Ambrosial Arbor...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: According to tradition, from then on, successive high elders were obliged to return to the Dragonvista Rain Hall. They would guide the tides of the ancient sea to guard and strengthen the Arbor's seal.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Do you remember now?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: Yes, "reverence to the three talons, the path to the great roots..." It's the way to the root depths.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Is that some kind of riddle? "Reverence to the three talons..." What the heck does that mean?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: Don't worry about it, just follow me.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: What a huge palace — completely abandoned... That must have been difficult for them — imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: For the Vidyadhara, it must have been a necessary sacrifice.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Middle-Aged Voice: If your people knew that you had brought me here, there would be great unrest.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Voice of High Elder]: They will never know. Keep quiet, Yingxing — this will make us even. I will give you two hours — research what you can. Remember — two hours.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Middle-Aged Voice: I'm a short-life species, do you think two hours isn't enough? It will be done.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Voice of High Elder]: Hmph...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: ...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: That's Dan Feng's voice... but what about the other person? So familiar...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Old Voice]: Who are you!?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Lady's Voice: ...Dan Feng said only the high elder can enter here.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Old Voice]: That traitor is already dead. Who are you? What do you want with the high elder?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Lady's Voice: What do I want?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Lady's Voice: I want to see her... see how she's faring... I want to see her!
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: ...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: A mysterious intruder... but that voice is so familiar...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Cold Voice]: That should do, general.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Young Voice]: Mm, enough.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Young Voice]: Haha, don't be nervous sir, this is a mere formality for me and the Ten-Lords Commission.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Unfeeling Voice]: This is of vital importance to the Ambrosial Arbor's seals — safety must be guaranteed.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Cold Voice]: Quelling the Arbor is the duty of the Vidyadhara.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Unfeeling Voice]: Keep in mind, this generation cannot afford to repeat the failure of the previous high elder.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Cold Voice]: ...Of course.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: ...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: The Cloud Knight general and the Ten-Lords Commission. They performed regular inspections of Scalegorge Waterscape...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Young Lady's Voice: Young master, must we really forsake Scalegorge Waterscape?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Voice of High Elder]: ...Can you forgive me, Yueyan?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Young Lady's Voice: I cannot say, young master. I feel resentment in my heart, but there are also... feelings I cannot put into words.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: Young Lady's Voice: The senior Vidyadhara say that the Xianzhou offered us this place — that we hail from another world. Is it time to repay them?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Narration]: ...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: It is time to repay them.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: What is this?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Miss March, I would advise you to refrain from interfering with the Vidyadhara.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Huh? The Vidyadhara? You mean these pearls will turn into people?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: When the life of a Vidyadhara is over, they return to the ancient sea and form a shell, before emerging anew. This is the hatching rebirth cycle.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: ...Whoaaaa...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Welt]: The Arbor is near, but if we can't complete this ceremony then we won't be able to get close.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Phantylia will soon have control of the Arbor... Quickly.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: This is one of the places mentioned in the riddle — one of the three talons. If we can break the seal here, we'll be a step closer to the roots of the Arbor.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Those seals you mentioned — do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: That's right. From what I recall, we have to touch these stone lanterns in a particular sequence to unlock the seals in this area.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: In that case then, I'll leave it to you.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: I'll... do my best.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: It worked.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: General, did you... hear about Miss Tingyun...?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: I received word from Lady Fu. The depth of Phantylia's infiltration, along with her meticulous planning, makes her extremely difficult to guard against.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: The Cloud Knights will carry out an investigation, but for now our most pressing matter is to put a stop to Phantylia's scheme.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: ...This seal was already on the verge of breaking before the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: Okay, let's head to the third seal.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: The last of the three talons is here.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: The reverence to the three talons is complete... Now we must head for the roots of the Arbor.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: The roots of the Arbor are still growing.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: It's Phantylia... We must hurry.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Hey, check it out. The bases of these stone lanterns are different...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: This mural is pretty interesting... Looks like time hasn't had any effect on it.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: This mural must be related to the others here. It tells the story of the Vidyadhara self-reincarnation, from the hatching rebirth in the ancient sea, to the return to that same sea as the cycle begins again.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Hey, do you think this could be related to the seals?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: Perhaps.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Perhaps...? Fair enough, it's tough racking your brains all the time — I'm struggling to keep track...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: "Beneath the lunar glow adorned, Vidyadhara eggs begin to form, and from the ancient sea rebirthed, to walk again on solid earth."
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: This mural describes the Vidyadhara hatching rebirth in the Lunarescent Depths — the beginning of self-reincarnation.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: "Our reincarnation's greatest cost, the wisdom of a past life lost, yet through the teachings of our kind, unto the young again consigned."
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: The mural depicts the Vidyadhara being guided by their elder, wiser kin after their rebirth.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: "Our people sing the hymn of clouds, and dance to water's cherished sounds, and high above the dragon flies, to each is destined different skies."
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: This mural portrays the Vidyadhara young. They acquire knowledge and depart for different places on the Xianzhou — thereby dedicating themselves to serving the Alliance.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: "And as the day is almost gone, return alone to water's song, beneath the waves in silver shell, await new life that time will tell."
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: The worldly limit of the Vidyadhara is reached after seven centuries. They return to the ancient sea and form a shell — awaiting the next hatching rebirth.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: What seems to be the problem, friend? It would appear the seals have you at a loss.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: Could the murals in our vicinity be related to the seals?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: There are abominations up ahead. Careful, everyone.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Welt]: Hmm... did you notice the flagstone the creature was stepping on? I wonder if it has any connection to the seal...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][March 7th]: Is that a dragon!?
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: We've reached the end. These are the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor, where the vestiges of Abundance lie.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: "Reverence to the three talons, the path to the great roots..." This is it. Under the power of the high elder, the Arbor's roots have formed into the image of a dragon.
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Dan Heng]: Now, I will break the final seal...
[A Dragon Gallant, Its Ocean Distant][Jing Yuan]: I hope everyone is prepared?

[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Oh? Hee-hee, has the general of the Luofu chosen to grace me with his presence?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: That witch! She was here waiting for us the whole time. Show yourself, Phantylia!
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: And the benefactors, too? Patience, patience, let me make myself presentable...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Now I see why the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus hold themselves in such vibrant regard. The Arbor's traces really do possess the power of metamorphosis and resurrection.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: All of you, ready yourselves.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Dan Heng, guard my back. I'm counting on you.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Dan Heng]: Understood.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Now, which of you little creatures wished to see me, hmm?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: My, it's gone a little quiet...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: Phantylia... what is she doing?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Benefactors, behold this beautiful body... the miracles of Abundance live up to the name.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Let's see if I can put it to good use.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: The very power that brought the Xianzhou long life, I will use to bring it destruction.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Phantylia has usurped the power of the Arbor.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: All of you — focus on destroying the phantom flowers — I'll go for the body.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: So much bark with so little bite — your attacks are futile.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Hahaha... this body was born of the Arbor. You are but ants.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: That's some strong wind!
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Welt]: March, careful!
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Try untangling yourselves from this.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: The weeds in my garden give me more grief.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Your arrogance betrays you.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Crushing an ant with the weight of a star — how indulgent.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: The universe will end in destruction, and with it the Abundance and the Hunt will disappear...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: General of the Xianzhou, can your feeble strength survive this calamity?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Dan Heng... you take it from here.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Dan Heng]: Did you think it was over, Phantylia?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Narration]: Use "Cloudhymn Roar" to attack Phantylia.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Oh? A Scion of Permanence?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Have you finally remembered your duty of watching over the Arbor?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Are we still ants to you, Phantylia?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: So much effort to crush us and met with so little success... I wonder what the other Ravagers think.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: It's almost as if you can't wait to be acquainted with them... I'm afraid you won't have the chance.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Narration]: Summon the Lightning-Lord and eliminate the flowers generated by Phantylia.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Out of ideas, Phantylia?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Forgive my indulgence. Your struggle in the face of certain death is... touching.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: For my next trick, I shall turn each of you into my Voidrangers.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: The power of the Destruction will eat away at your flesh and transform you into the pawns of the great Nanook!
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Let's start with this arrogant Xianzhou general...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Hahahahaha...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: I wonder if the transformation of a Xianzhou general into a Voidranger...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: ...would cast the Luofu back into chaos?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Destruction works in fascinating ways...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Haha...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: What are you—
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Dan Heng! Do it—
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: Not bad, General of The Hunt...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: But all I lost was a body stolen on a whim.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: And you...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: How much longer can you last?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Phantylia]: The destruction of the Xianzhou... is nigh.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Begone,
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Pawn of Destruction.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Tell the Legion,
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: that the vengeance of The Hunt
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: will fall upon them.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: General, are you... okay?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: I'm still alive.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: ...And it would seem the two of us can still coordinate our efforts.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Dan Heng]: ...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: *sigh* Phantylia... a truly fearsome enemy. If she hadn't attempted to turn me into a pawn of Destruction, I'm afraid victory would have been far from certain.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Phantylia had established a link between me and herself. Your well-timed strike gravely injured her — thus, her connection to the Arbor was severed.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: So it was all part of the plan! When Dan Heng stabbed you, I was scared to death...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Narration]: Is Phantylia... still alive?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Narration]: Is that thing... dead?
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: It takes more than that to destroy an Emanator of Destruction. Still...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Welt]: Phantylia won't be stirring up trouble any time soon — don't worry about her infecting the Arbor again. It's just that sealing the Stellaron is going to take some time...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Jing Yuan]: Leave that to the master diviner... I'm afraid I may be... somewhat spent...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: General, keep those eyes open, now's not the time to fall asleep!
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][March 7th]: Hey! Wake up...
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Narration]: A few moments later, Fu Xuan and the Clouds [sic] Knights arrived. A starskiff was ready to take you all to Exalting Sanctum.
[Demise of Immortality, Finale of Calamity][Narration]: ,  "Pedujara: Demiseless Existence" ×1)

[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Some time later, you arrive at the Seat of Divine Foresight to check on Jing Yuan...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Can you wait a little moment? The master diviner will be here soon.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: She's temporarily taken on the general's responsibilities. Before meeting you, she must make the current situation known and fortify public spirit. This is her first real test as a general — I hope she can get used to things quickly.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: ...I don't think I can ever get used to this.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: *sigh* It's a pleasure to see you all here today.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Collating casualties and losses, dispatching forces to round up the remnants of the Disciples, submitting battle reports to the Six Charioteers... Now I know what Jing Yuan meant when he said "the highest throne faces the strongest winds."
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: But you're enjoying yourself, right?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Generalship is no trifling matter — how could I be "enjoying myself?" All I can do is get used to it, hmph...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: 
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Share your troubles with me.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Generalship is no trifling matter — it is a duty one must bear.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: 
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Master Diviner, have you summoned us here just to sigh and complain?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Of course not! On the contrary, I am eager to thank you all in my official capacity as acting general of the Luofu. Now that things have drawn to a conclusion, it is time to reward you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Oooo! All those benefits that the general promised — they're finally here! Yippee!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Yes, the Astral Express has braved great evil for the Luofu. Your devotion is evident. After discussions with the Six Charioteers, you are henceforth sworn allies of the Luofu. Within the Luofu's jurisdiction, you are to be treated with the highest standard of diplomatic protocol.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: On behalf of the Astral Express, I would like to thank you, Master Diviner.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Now that thanks have been expressed, I still have something to discuss with you. Please, this way.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: ...Seriously? Thanking us like that, and then immediately sending us on another mission?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: It's not a mission. The Stellaron crisis, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus rebellion, the Arbor's resurrection, not to mention the Antimatter Legion infiltrating the Luofu... All of these incidents need reporting at the highest level for investigation.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: ...It's just that, having been in the middle of everything, I'm struggling to keep an accurate perspective. I would appreciate if you could go through it all with me, so that I can reacquaint myself with the finer detail.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: So, where should we begin?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Let's discuss Phantylia first...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 1 Stelle.mp4      Media:Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 1 Caelus.mp4
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: It appears that Phantylia was the mastermind behind it all. The Xianzhou warred with the Antimatter Legion in the past, and ever since we have kept a watchful eye on their movements.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Few could have foreseen the insidious tactics employed in the execution of their assaults. The Lord Ravager slithered in unnoticed, clandestinely plotting and machinating, and surreptitiously bestowed a Stellaron upon the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. This heinous act instigated an uprising aimed at luring the Luofu into a perilous trap of self-destruction.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: The present danger posed by the Legion clearly demands a re-evaluation. We should proceed cautiously.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Let's talk about the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 2.mp4
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: When the Ambrosial Arbor was severed by the Reignbow Arbiter thousands of years ago, the Abundance became a taboo. Those within the Alchemy Commission — the original masters of the so-called "way of immortality" — were ruined at a stroke. The commission became a shadow of its former self.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Presumably, from that moment on, the seeds of discord for the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus had already been planted... Some of them were willing to work with the enemy, acquiring a Stellaron from the Antimatter Legion to try and revive the Abundance.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 3.mp4
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Hmm... They succeeded alright, but why would Phantylia's objective be to realize their wishes? Those traitors gained nothing — they betrayed the Xianzhou only to become sacrificial offerings in the Lord Ravager's grand scheme.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Let's discuss the Stellaron Hunters...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 4 Stelle.mp4      Media:Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 4 Caelus.mp4
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: The Stellaron Hunters? We know just as little. But in the Matrix of Prescience, I saw a prophecy that Kafka received from Destiny's Slave. Elio foresaw all manner of possibilities for the Luofu...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead 5.mp4
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Based on what Kafka knows, and despite everything being under the control of Elio, that prophecy is indeed the most beneficial future for the Luofu. The Stellaron Hunters walked right into our trap, and even gifted allies — in the form of yourselves — to the Xianzhou... That might sound self-interested, but I hope the feeling is mutual.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Now that future has come true, the Xianzhou has discovered the Legion's intentions, and with everyone's help, has imposed a crushing defeat on Phantylia.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I think we already have the gist...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: That we may, but as logical as things might seem, there are still many details about which we're uncertain.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: For example, how was the Stellaron brought onto the Xianzhou? And who sent it on to Scalegorge Waterscape? How many Disciples of Sanctus Medicus still remain at large? All of this is a mystery. Thus far, we've done our best.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: I'm submitting my written report to the Alliance, and I've already got a plan in mind. All of you will feature in the report, but for the sake of Jing Yuan, anything related to Xianzhou internal affairs will have names redacted — I hope you can forgive me.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: I was about to make the same request, Master Diviner. Since the Arbor's resurrection, I'm sure the Alliance will be poring over every detail of the report. I fear that if the Astral Express gets dragged into matters, leaving will not be an easy task.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Mm. Jing Yuan has committed quite a few violations this time around, and I'll have to deal with them one by one... *sigh* The Cloud Knight generals are all such a hassle.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Before you leave, please take time to recuperate. If there's anywhere you'd like to visit, feel free to take a look. I must attend to some Cloud Knight matters — farewell for now.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Oh — if you pass through Starskiff Haven, I have something that I hope you can give to Yukong.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Something Miss Tingyun left behind?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: *sigh* It was all so chaotic. When Phantylia took form, it was as if Tingyun vanished into thin air.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: The Cloud Knights were only able to find her fan — she took it with her everywhere. It's currently unclear if Tingyun was a puppet manipulated by Phantylia, or if some form of deception was used to cloud our vision.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: I'm already prepared for the worst. Considering how the Legion operates, I fear the fate of the Sky-Faring Commission Amicassador may be a bleak one.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: As for how matters are handled with regards to Tingyun, I believe it's best left to her Foxian kin. I have informed the Sky-Faring Commission of the events which took place, and I think it would be best if you were the one to deliver this item to Yukong.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: ...I understand. Leave it with us.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Thank you, Mr. Yang. Now, let me take a look at my remaining duties for the day. *sigh* It's quite the list...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: It's getting late. If you need me, I'll be in the Divination Commission Conclave Hall.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the Luofu without breaking a sweat. Feels kinda surreal.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Maybe this was all fate.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: , you don't sound very happy.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We're just mere puppets of the Stellaron Hunters...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Bah, no way! Everything good that has come our way is due to our own hard work. I'm not letting them take any of the credit.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: It may seem like the Stellaron Hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. No matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Since showing up, we've saved a lot of people and averted disaster for the whole Xianzhou. Who cares whether someone or something was directing it? Be happy, !
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: What are your plans from here?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: ...Actually, I was wondering if Diviner Fu could do me a favor.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: The Matrix of Prescience has amazing powers, and can iterate and reiterate Kafka's past... So it got me thinking — if I turned the Matrix on me, could it calculate my past?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Pretty smart.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Hee-hee, yup! When you're free, let's head over to the Divination Commission together and ask them for a favor.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Why didn't you ask Fu Xuan for help while she was here?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: I was shy! Talking about personal stuff like that in front of everyone... it'd be too embarrassing!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: When you're free, let's go hit up the Divination Commission together and see what Fu Xuan has to say.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Here's hoping the Matrix is accurate, and that Diviner Fu won't decline our request...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Things have come to a close for now. It's good that you came through unscathed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Thanks for looking out for me, Mr. Yang.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: What are we going to do next?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: The master diviner asked us to pass on this item of Tingyun's. I'll go to the Palace of Astrum and meet with Yukong. If neither of you has anything urgent, it'd be best if you came too.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: How am I gonna break this to Madam Yukong...? Maybe she's already heard the news.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: Returning to the Luofu and Scalegorge Waterscape... it's a surreal feeling.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: I left so determined... Who would have thought that circumstances would draw me back once more?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: It's not like the Xianzhou has done anything to you... yet.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: There are only a handful of individuals who know my identity now. I do not wish to guess what could occur if word gets out.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: How long do you plan on staying here?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: I'll be gone very soon. Jing Yuan is still recovering, and the Cloud Knights won't protect me anymore... It remains to be seen how the Six Charioteers will react to my presence.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: But at least for now, I'm safe.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: What are you going to do next?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: I want to meet the current high elder of the Vidyadhara.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: It seems I won't be able to cast off Dan Feng's negative karma... so I'd like to learn more about his past. I want to find out what I can do to make up for his sins.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: If you're planning on an extended stay on the Luofu, I'm afraid I won't be able to join you. I'm sorry, .
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: I want to meet the current high elder of the Vidyadhara.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: If she can tell me more about Dan Feng's actions, then perhaps I can do something to make up for his sins.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: The Ambrosial Arbor is dormant. Thanks to everyone's hard-fought battles, the Luofu is safe once more.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Before he left, the general told me to handle things at the Seat of Divine Foresight. Fortunately, now that victory has been achieved, the plans we prepared will never see the light of day. However...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: The general did order that if he were unable to return to duty, then the master diviner would take over his duties temporarily.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Is the general okay?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Alas, I'm no healer, I'm afraid I couldn't say.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: I ordered a military doctor to provide the most comprehensive emergency treatment they could. The Alchemy Commission was caught up in the Sanctus Medicus conspiracy — it took a lot of work to find someone trustworthy enough to heal the general.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: If we can help, don't hesitate to ask. I don't know much about medicine, but... there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Don't worry, long-life species are resilient and strong — the general will pull through. He's faced down situations a hundred times more dangerous than this.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: What do you plan on doing with the Ambrosial Arbor?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: What do we plan on doing... *sigh* Thousands of years ago, the Xianzhou Alliance was at its wit's end trying to deal with it. Today, nothing's changed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: The Arbor was resurrected. Aside from the Arbiter's Lux Arrow, I'm afraid that nothing can materially harm it. We might be able to suppress it with the help of the Vidyadhara, but with internal strife ravaging their ranks, I'm afraid it's a long shot...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: If you can locate exactly where the Stellaron is within the Arbor, then the Express might be able to help out.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Yang. But something as important and fundamental as the Ambrosial Arbor will require a meeting and deliberation from the Six Charioteers.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Fu Xuan seems to be handling things pretty well...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Better to wait until the master diviner has another twenty or thirty years under her belt.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: Subduing the enemy is one of the most minor parts of a general's work. They have to meet with the Luofu's Six Charioteers and undergo Ten-Lords Commission inspections — all while dealing with the Xianzhou Alliance's top brass...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: None of it is easy to navigate, but it's a daily responsibility. The crown of a general sits heavy on the head indeed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: I almost forgot — I need to gather data for the master diviner's draft report. Bye for now.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingzu]: The Luofu's troubles... have only just begun. I don't know if the master diviner can take all this on.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I see. Please extend my regards to the Ten Lords...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xueyi]: I will. Our condolences, Helm Master.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xueyi]: You have guests. I shall take my leave.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Ahem... On behalf of the Sky-Faring Commission, I would like to thank the crew of the Express for saving the Luofu from the Stellaron crisis.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Madam Yukong must have heard about Miss Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Yes, I have heard. Seeing four leave, yet only three return, was enough for me to know that Fu Xuan's report was indeed correct.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: ...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Miss Tingyun left this behind...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I still can't believe it. The whole report reads like a bad joke — it's simply unimaginable.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: The Antimatter Legion on the Xianzhou? And Tingyun... a Lord Ravager?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: How could someone who spent over thirty years working alongside me at the Sky-Faring Commission... turn out to be nothing more than a monster in disguise? What happened to the real Tingyun?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Madam Yukong...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I'm sorry... I understand... It's just hard for me to accept...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: *sigh* Thank you for bringing Tingyun's belongings back to the Palace of Astrum. The Stellaron crisis has cost us too many comrades, brothers, sisters... children.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I'd like to invite all of you, as witnesses to this war, to a soul-soothing ceremony hosted by the Sky-Faring Commission. Will you consider?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: A "soul-soothing ceremony"?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: To put it into short-life terms — a funeral. You see, for long-life species of the Xianzhou, death has always been a distant, mystical concept.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Ordinarily, the Ten-Lords Commission guides people to the Hall of Karma before any symptoms of mara are detected. There, they leave behind their lives and wait for their time to come. People are used to a short "farewell" as opposed to a tedious "burial" process.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Given our limited life spans, the only ones who place value on ceremony are us Foxians.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Countless Cloud Knights lost their lives or became mara-struck during the crisis. The Hall of Karma couldn't take them all in, and so they passed away.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: All of these sudden deaths and unfulfilled wishes remind us... that long-life species still live out insignificant and limited lives.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: By combining Sky-Faring Commission technology with Foxian ceremony, we honor those who have passed on. We place items of the dead onto starskiffs, and send them out to sail between the stars — to shine brightly among them.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: It's not just to comfort the dead — those souls who can never talk with us again — but also to comfort their surviving relatives, close friends, and indeed all residents of the Xianzhou...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: It's also my way of saying farewell to Tingyun. I know, I'm selfish. She may not have died a Cloud Knight, but she's still one of us here at the Sky-Faring Commission — a victim caught up in a wider conflict.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I'd like to hold this ceremony as a way of distancing the memory of Tingyun from the Lord Ravager who tarnished her identity.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I... can still hardly believe it. I'll use my own methods to locate Tingyun's whereabouts, but at present... I...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: This is the least I can do for her.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I'd like to ask you all to witness this event with me.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: How can we help?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We'll be there at the ceremony.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I've instructed Yanming to sort through Tingyun's belongings. I hope you can pick some out to place around the starskiff.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Leave this to us, we'll take care of it as per your wishes, Madam Yukong.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Once again, my thanks to all of you. I've asked the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission to ratify this soul-soothing ceremony, and have commissioned a special skiff at Stargazer Navalia for the ceremony. If you need anything, that's where I'll be.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: You always did say that I liked to gossip, and here I am rambling on proving you right again... If only you were here to cut me off...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: ...Or you could just cut yourself off?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Mr. Yanming?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: Oh! It's you... For a moment I thought she'd returned... Did the Helm Master send you over?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: We're here to help sort out Miss Tingyun's things. Madam Yukong wants to use some of them for her soul-soothing ceremony.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: Well, I've managed to get through pretty much everything — it's all in this box. Please, take your time.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Okay, let's see what there is.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: An Amicassador's seal, a small box... a knife? A bow, and something wrapped up tight... I wonder what this is.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Looks like some kind of antique? But who'd want to hold on to something like this...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: Oh, Tingyun explained that one to me. It's a folk statuette from Foxian antiquity. They say it can bring wealth if placed correctly.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: There's also a note in the package: "This is for you, Mr. Yanming. Wishing you fortune and success in every endeavor." Yanming, it seems like this is a gift for you from Miss Tingyun.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: I... I remember asking her for one at the time... Ahem, this is unexpected. I only mentioned it in passing, but she remembered.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: ...Tingyun and I were from different guilds. We were competitors... but also colleagues.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: When we used to trade in other lands, we would bring back local specialties and distribute them among friends and other guild members — it became a custom.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: The rivalry between us and Whistling Flames to be the Sky-Faring Commission's top guild was always fierce. We would gift each other all kinds of bizarre oddities: Candy that made your leg hair grow, a violin that could shatter glass with its piercing shriek...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: *sigh* ...I was completely unprepared for this. I never thought Tingyun would leave something behind for me that was so sincere and earnest.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: If I don't return a gift, I'll lose our little duel... But what could I possibly gift her back?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow... None of this seems like something Miss Tingyun would've kept. I thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Could there be other things similar to what Yanming got? We should take a look.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I want to take a look in that box...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: There's nothing else... except a handful of seeds.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: It looks like there's something printed on the bottom of the box... The Sleepless Earl. Let me think — where have I seen that name before?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I want to take a look at that knife...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: I can't cook to save my life, but one thing I'm sure of is: That's a kitchen knife.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: I've never seen Miss Tingyun use anything like that to defend herself... It must be another gift that she never had time to send.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: There's an ad in the knife case: "Spices Supreme," Aurum Alley? Which store is that again?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I want to take a look at that bow...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: This bow...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: March plucks the bowstring
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: It's a good bow. It couldn't be meant for me... could it?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Think again...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm sure you weren't the only archer she knew.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Alright, just kidding. Just trying to liven things up around here.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We should get going.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Do you know where we're supposed to take these things, ?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: Tingyun, Tingyun... What am I going to get for you? If only you... *sigh*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: The Sleepless Earl... Was that the name of that teahouse at the port when we first got into town?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Welcome to the Sleepless Earl! I'm the owner here — the name's Mengming. How many of you are there? Which tea would you like today?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We're here on a gift-giving errand for Miss Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Oh! This is... This is the tea Miss Tingyun promised to get for me! She really went to another world for this? She's incredible.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: When I took over this teahouse from my parents, I thought I'd shake things up by creating a new tea product.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Famous brews like Whale-Tide Spring or Vegetations in the Alchemy Cauldron have been around for millennia, and imported mixed teas have also found a niche. Introducing a new product into the industry is really hard.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Miss Tingyun came to the teahouse one day and heard about my troubles — she said she could find me a brand-new strain during her travels — one that nobody on the Xianzhou had ever tasted.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: I just thought she was trying to cheer me up — I never thought she'd actually do it... Where is Miss Tingyun today?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: She's had to embark on another long voyage...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: ...Yes. Now that the crisis has been averted and the ports are resuming operations, Miss Tingyun has been dispatched on business with the Sky-Faring Commission... out to other worlds.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Oh, really? That's a shame. Well... hold on a sec.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: A few moments later, Mengming serves the tea she brewed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Based on her suggestion, I improved the Whale-Tide Spring, Emerald Hills, and Dawndew strains to make a new variety with a sweet, long-lasting taste. I called it "Tingyun's Blend."
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Seeing as she can't enjoy it right now, I'll have to invite all of you to try a cup.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm afraid Miss Tingyun is...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: You tell Mengming about what happened to Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Miss Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: We found this box of seeds among her belongings. I'm sure Miss Tingyun would have liked for you to have it.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: ...Thank you, all of you. I think... I should gift something to Tingyun in return.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: A few moments later, Mengming serves the tea she brewed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Based on her suggestion, I improved the Whale-Tide Spring, Emerald Hills, and Dawndew strains to make a new variety with a sweet, long-lasting taste. I called it "Tingyun's Blend."
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: Seeing as Tingyun won't be able to try it... we should drink a cup to her memory.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: I can't wait for Miss Tingyun to try this tea!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mengming]: I'm sorry you won't be able to try this tea, Miss Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: , how's it going? Did you take some time off? See any more of the Xianzhou?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Have you heard of Spices Supreme?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Isn't that the place on Aurum Alley over in Exalting Sanctum? All the foodies go there. What about it? Planning on treating me to a feast?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Aurum Alley?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Go on...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: It's the main commercial street in the Exalting Sanctum, although it's a lot quieter since the whole Stellaron crisis thing.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Tourists fresh off the starskiff always head to Starwatcher Avenue in Starskiff Haven — it's one of those bustling tourist streets... But, if you want the real deal on local snacks, you've gotta get to Aurum Alley. I've marked it out for you on your map.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Whenever I'm tired of celestial jade or slacking off, I head over for a bowl of Granny Chen's Tofu. Darn it, now that you've brought it up, I suddenly don't feel like clocking in for work anymore.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Spices Supreme... Check out that sign. Here it is!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: Honored guests, welcome to our humble eatery! What can we get for you today?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We're here on a gift-giving errand for Miss Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: Something from Miss Tingyun for me...?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: Hahaha, what a precious person she is. A sweet thing like her, gifting me a kitchen knife.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: When she first ate here, I told her my motto: "You can't better your own food unless you taste it." Then she got me to talk about my hunting and cooking experiences out on other worlds.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: She was captivated — she pestered me about dish after dish... At the end, she mentioned she wanted to get me a gift: "A sword for a hero, and a knife for a chef" — that's how she put it.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: She probably came across some rare mineral and forged it by hand. Look how sharp it is! I bet it'd cut straight through a Thalassa Titanium Terrapin shell.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: *sigh* Miss Tingyun is too kind. Who among the Aurum Alley vendors hasn't been spoiled by the generosity of Whistling Flames? Her Grand Fair puts small merchants like us in touch with big intergalactic vendors. If we're talking gifts, it's us who should be gifting her something.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: I heard the trade port is open again for business. Miss Tingyun must be real busy, right?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Indeed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Miss Tingyun couldn't tear herself away from work, so we've had to gift this on her behalf today.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: Really, thank you so much. Why don't I give you all a demonstration and prepare a dish? My treat — I'd love to repay this kindness.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Yancui goes into the back kitchen and brings out a steaming bowl of food.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: Speaking of which, it was our Chili Beef Offal Stew that first attracted Miss Tingyun to our restaurant, hehe. It's spicy, sumptuous, and guaranteed to get the mouth watering. Not even a girl as refined as Tingyun could resist the temptation.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Actually... Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: You tell Yancui what happened to Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: This... This is real, right...?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: The monster you mentioned... where did it come from? ...I wish—I wish I could take this knife and cut it to ribbons...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: *sigh* Forget it... matters like these are beyond the control and understanding of a cook like me... Thank you, all of you. Let me prepare a dish for you... as a gift for Miss Tingyun.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Yancui goes into the back kitchen and brings out a steaming bowl of food.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: It was our Chili Oil Beef Offal Stew that first attracted Miss Tingyun to our restaurant... I can't believe that she'll never taste it again. Please, you'll have to eat her share too.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: It's a shame Miss Tingyun's too busy today...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yancui]: If only Miss Tingyun could try this one last time...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: About that bow — I think I know who Miss Tingyun intended to gift it to.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Mister Yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: The person who Tingyun trusts the most is Madam Yukong, right?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: The things Miss Tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: It's time to go back to Stargazer Navalia and see Madam Yukong.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: What brings you here?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We're here to pass on a gift from Miss Tingyun...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: This bow... Did Tingyun pick it out for me? She understood my pain — it's a shame I can no longer do anything for her...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Thirty years ago, I fought in a terrible war. My comrade and I set sail together, but only I returned.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: The scars of that war never truly healed. Still, the Luofu traced out its arc of recovery, and continued to trade...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I felt tired of voyaging — like I'd lost the courage to pull on a bowstring ever again. I hid away in the Sky-Faring Commission and buried myself in work, never wanting to see the sky again.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Despite rising to Helm Master, my military career hadn't prepared me for the type of meticulous planning work now confronting me. Tingyun, on the other hand, was a born merchant — always discussing business matters with me and offering up advice — even if she was my subordinate.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: She never fought alongside me on the battlefield, but in her own way, she became a comrade-in-arms. Without the help of Tingyun and the guild, the Luofu would not have been able to recover in the space of just thirty short years.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I used to think that the Xianzhou had changed with the times. Geniuses like Tingyun were the future for the Sky-Faring Commission's next generation — they would bring prosperity to the Luofu. I was only ever suited to the flames of war.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I was wrong. Only when the last minions of the Antimatter Legion are wiped out, will I become useless to the Xianzhou... The Xianzhou needs people like me — those willing to cruise the sky and fight the flames.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Tingyun prepared gifts for others, too? That's just like her...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Thank you for helping her complete all these tasks. She can depart in peace.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: We're still preparing the starskiff for the ceremony. Please, everyone, come back to me when your work is complete.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I heard Tingyun prepared gifts for others, too? That's just like her...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Thank you for helping her complete all these tasks. She can depart in peace.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: We're still preparing the starskiff for the ceremony. Please, everyone, come back to me when your work is complete.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: The starskiff is ready for the ceremony now. Everyone, please place your objects aboard the starskiff.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][???]: W—Wait! Wait for me!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: Miss Tingyun prepared a gift for me. As a fellow amicassador, I cannot fail to honor our custom...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Yanming, what is it that you've prepared?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: I... I've brought a paper kite. I know it may seem simple compared to the precious items that Tingyun gifted others in the past... but it has a deeper meaning.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: I heard that Foxians have a tradition where paper kites are used to comfort the souls of pilots who can no longer take to the skies. Tingyun and I were never pilots in the strictest sense of the word... but we spent much our lives out among the stars.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: For her to be able to take wing once again... would make her very happy.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: , if you're ready, please select a few items to place aboard the starskiff.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: Paper kites are often gifted to children, but as a symbol of spreading one's wings and soaring high up into the sky, they are also a comfort to Foxian pilots. It's an old tradition that's carried on to this day.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: , out of all this stuff we've got, what do you think we should place on the starskiff?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: The amicassador's seal
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Thank you for everything you've done for the Sky-Faring Commission and the Luofu. This small seal is the foundation of the Xianzhou's prosperity.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: The tea named after her
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Hmm? , did you forget that we already drank that back at the teahouse?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: This is the tea that Mengming has made, especially named after you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Her favorite dish
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Uh, you already ate that, remember? I can't just get you another one now, can I?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: This is a gift from Miss Yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on Aurum Alley. You are going to love this.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: The soul-soothing paper kite
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanming]: This time, we needn't compete. Go, fly on to other distant worlds.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: The Sky-Faring Commission shall never forget you, Tingyun. I will seek out the truth, and if it is discovered that you were taken from us, I swear to avenge your unjust end.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: It is time for the soul-soothing ceremony. Please make your way to Earthrise Agora in Starskiff Haven.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: General, the ceremony has finished. You should take a rest.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Not yet. I have things I wish to convey to my Astral friends.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: My apologies, I couldn't get to you any sooner — Yanqing made sure that I was fully recuperated...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Before you leave the Luofu, there are two things I wish to gift the Express.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Two gifts? Has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? Is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: You're too kind, General!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'd like some free real estate, please!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Please, let us reconvene at the Seat of Divine Foresight.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: I once held the same ceremony on the Fanghu, some thirty years or so ago now. Painful memories don't ever fade away with time, and I don't want to bear witness to those scenes again.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Once I've finished handling the various tasks at hand, I want to aid the Cloud Knights in their investigation. I'll fly out on a starskiff and trace Tingyun's original flight path onto the Xianzhou. Rest assured, I will leave no stone unturned.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: So they also hold funerals... huh...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Surprised Visitor]: Is your dream dashed?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: No, I'm just feeling a bit sentimental.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: I wonder what lies at the end of life...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Surprised Visitor]: I've got it. It turns out that this ceremony of theirs is a Xianzhou funeral.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: So they also hold funerals... huh... I thought they'd be...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Surprised Visitor]: Why do you look so disappointed? Is your dream dashed?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: What are you talking about? I'm just feeling a bit sentimental. The hero I'm looking for is one of the Cloud Knights. Unfortunately, he has passed away...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Surprised Visitor]: Are you talking about your hometown fairy tale? The one about the "Longsword Knight" that rescued hundreds of people with a battered sword?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: Yes, it's him... It isn't a fairy tale, but a historical event that took place centuries ago. I thought he was an invincible hero that was spared from illness and death. Little did I know...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: For some reason, seeing the funeral makes me feel a bit sentimental... What do you think lies at the end of life?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Surprised Visitor]: ...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Emotional Visitor]: So they also hold funerals... huh...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exhausted Lady]: I can see him every time I close my eyes...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Concerned Elder]: You need to rest.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exhausted Lady]: I can't sleep...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Concerned Elder]: You have to be strong.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exhausted Lady]: I can see him every time I close my eyes...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Concerned Elder]: How long have you been awake? You need to rest. You can't go on like this.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exhausted Lady]: I have no idea... Since he left, the house was so empty, I couldn't sleep.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Concerned Elder]: Just do it for his sake. I'm sure he wouldn't want to see you in this state. You need to be strong.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Concerned Elder]: Other matters aside, how are you going to attend the soul-soothing ceremony looking like this? Your life must go on, and you need to buck up...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Concerned Elder]: You need to keep on living.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: Did you get the invitation?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Seasoned Woman]: Yup.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: How should we go about this soul-soothing ceremony?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Seasoned Woman]: Let me think about it...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: You have got the invitation, haven't you?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Seasoned Woman]: Are you talking about his soul-soothing ceremony? Yes.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: In fact, I've never participated in this ceremony before, and I heard that your clan is quite experienced in it. Could you give me some advice?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: Do I need to prepare anything for it? Is there anything I should pay attention to?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Seasoned Woman]: According to our practice, you may find out what he liked when he was alive. Then, prepare the gift and put it on his starskiff.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: I see... Thanks for the advice!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Man]: I've never attended a memorial, and I don't know what I should do here...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: Is a funeral happening on the Luofu soon?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: The Outworlders call this a funeral...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: Having lived for centuries, this has been my first time participating in a funeral...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: Can you tell me what I should do?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: Generally speaking, your attendance at the funeral itself...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: ...means a lot.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: I hope so.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: Is a funeral happening on the Xianzhou Luofu soon? It's my first time seeing it.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: So you guys call this thing a funeral...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: I've heard of it, but this has been my first time participating in one in my entire life.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: May I know... what I can do for my deceased Cloud Knight friend?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: Generally speaking, you don't have to do anything. Your attendance at the funeral itself means a lot.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: Your friend will surely feel it.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dejected Man]: I hope so. Thank you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Considerate Outworlder]: Is the Xianzhou Luofu going to hold a funeral?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: Why are you sighing at such a young age?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: *sighs*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: Is it because of... him?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: *sighs*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: ...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: *sighs*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: That's enough sighing for one day. Why are you sighing at such a young age?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: *sighs* You won't get it even if I tell you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: ... Are you bothered because you weren't invited to his soul-soothing ceremony?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: Yes, and no... Everyone else was invited, and even "she" was there. Alas...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: Are you jealous?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: Not at all. I just wonder what got into the beautiful girl's head that made her go to the funeral... *sigh*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Exasperated Woman]: ...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Gloomy Woman]: *sighs*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: I've never taken part in a soul-soothing ceremony before...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: They use a starskiff to send condolences?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Woman]: Has your family member passed away too?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: She had an early-onset mara attack...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: The Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission came...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: ...but missed out on the chance to take her away.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Woman]: Just believe in the starskiff...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Woman]: It will carry your thoughts and affection...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Woman]: ...to the other side where she is located.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: I've never taken part in a soul-soothing ceremony before...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Man]: They use a starskiff to send condolences?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Child]: That lady is bawling her eyes out...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Ignorant Child]: It's because all things come to an end.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Child]: Why are you waxing poetic all of a sudden?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Ignorant Child]: Um, that was what my father said!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Child]: When I was heading out, I heard the lady across the street bawling her eyes out...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Ignorant Child]: She's getting ready for the ceremony, which my parents have been working on lately.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Child]: Ceremony? What's that?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Ignorant Child]: *sighs* You're still a little kid. All things come to an end... You'll only understand it when you're older.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Child]: ... Why are you waxing poetic all of a sudden? This is so not like you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Ignorant Child]: Um, that was actually what my father said...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Confused Child]: That lady is crying her eyes out...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Remorseful Kid]: Dad, is Mom there too?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sad Father]: Yes... I'll bring you to her in a couple of days.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Remorseful Kid]: Is she still mad at me?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sad Father]: No...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Listen
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Remorseful Kid]: Dad, is Mom there too? Uncle told me that Mom and Aunt are both in there...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sad Father]: Yes, she's there... Let's wait for a couple more days, then I'll bring you to her.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Remorseful Kid]: Dad, please tell me the truth. Is Mom still mad at me... Otherwise, why doesn't she come home?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sad Father]: No. How can she be mad at you? *sighs* she [sic] can never be angry again...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sad Father]: Never again... Never...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Remorseful Kid]: Dad, what do you mean by that? I—I don't get it...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sad Father]: It's fine. You'll understand when you're older.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Remorseful Kid]: Why isn't Mom home yet?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Present company is gathered to reiterate the Xianzhou Luofu's esteemed gratitude for the magnanimous actions of the Nameless.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: I am sure Lady Fu has given voice to this already, but the Luofu is greatly indebted to you. Therefore, on behalf of the Luofu Cloud Knights, I hereby present you with a jade abacus — a symbol of our allied friendship.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: A jade abacus?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Is this a souvenir?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: It... could indeed be considered a souvenir of a certain variety. But not one you could find in a gift store.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Back when the Alliance was first established — all those thousands of years ago — the Xianzhou ships swore an oath, etching the record into a jade abacus. The world may crumble and the heavens may fall, but this oath shall never be broken.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: The same is true of this jade abacus — it is a record of the Luofu Cloud Knights' promise to the crew of the Astral Express. It is also a beacon — grip it tightly, and it will send a message to the jade abacus here in my hand.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: No matter how astronomically distant you are, the Luofu Cloud Knights will always come to the aid of the Crew, whatever your need may be.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Wow, now that's what I call a pay-off.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Ahem... Of course, I trust that such an important article will not be used for trivial or inappropriate circumstances. I hope you can understand...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Yup, got it. Say no more. Sure thing.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Thank you for your generosity, General.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Dan Heng.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: General...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: In accordance with the edict of the Ten-Lords Commission, I am hereby authorized to relieve your banishment decree. From this day henceforth, you may come and go freely on the Luofu...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Nice!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Nice!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Not a complete surprise.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...But I must remind you that the crimes of Dan Feng have had far-reaching implications... and some people, such as those in Scalegorge Waterscape, will not be much moved by the issuance of a paper edict.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: While I can guarantee your freedom to come and go as you please, I cannot guarantee your safety. Again, I hope you can understand.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: I understand.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: This issuing of gifts brings with it a sense of relief... Even my wound is feeling much improved. The occasion calls for a line or two of poetry... though I feel my efforts would be overshadowed by the erudition of Lady Fu. Another time, perhaps.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: The Express and its passengers have a long voyage ahead of them. May that voyage be smooth and untrammeled. I bid you Farewell.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: Oh hi, I know we haven't got the chance to get acquainted, but I've heard a lot of good things about the crew from the general. I have to say I'm very impressed.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: So soon?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: *sigh* I wanted to help the general, but things didn't turn out how I wanted them to be. I've learned my lesson.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: Also, I have a rather abrupt request.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: After fighting Dan Heng, I feel like my skills are lacking somewhere. If  have any time to coach me...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I think Dan Heng is a better match for you...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: I'm worried that he still holds some grudge against me. But to be honest, I'd love to have another spar with him.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: We could schedule in a couple of rounds...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: Deal.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: Safe travels.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yanqing]: Safe travels.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: , are you off then?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: The Xianzhou Luofu is all the richer for your brief time with us. I offer blessings on behalf of the Sky-Faring Commission, on the eve of your departure.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: If you require resupplying during your journey, you can always count on us.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Yukong]: Life is fleeting. We hope you'll have the opportunity to return to us on the Luofu soon.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Hi?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Are you listening to Mr. Xiyan's stories?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Sure am. Things have been in constant turmoil since I transferred to the Luofu. Now that I've got a little free time, I'm here to listen to some storytelling.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Are you... Sorry, I've met so many people recently, you seem unfamiliar... Judging by your clothes, you must be an outworlder?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Dan Heng told me all about...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm Dan Heng's friend...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Ahh, I see! Silent But Deadly told me something about meeting up with a friend. You must be them?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: ...Silent But Deadly?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Mm-hmm, pretty accurate nickname, right? That guy has a lot on his plate — it's enough to make you worry.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: The fact you're standing here right now must mean things are pretty much taken care of?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Is that so? Well, before you leave, I recommend listening to Mr. Xiyan's Legend of the High-Cloud Quintet.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: Ever since I was a little kid, I've always wanted to be an epic hero... I never get tired of hearing about the Quintet — I'm sure you'll love it.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: You should bring Dan Heng along next time, we can chat over some tea. Anyway, I'm getting off-track, I won't take any more of your time. Good luck.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Sushang]: You should bring Dan Heng along next time, we can chat over some tea.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: I'm guessing seeing you here probably means your affairs on the Xianzhou are mostly complete?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Is that it? I thought you were gonna stay for at least a little longer...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Did Welt learn how to play celestial jade in the end...? If he hasn't got the hang of it yet, tell him to come see me and I'll show him the ropes.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Oh, I haven't asked you yet — are you interested in learning yourself?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Sure, if it's easy to learn.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: Aha, I thought so. Come back when you have time — I'll teach you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Uhh... I'll pass.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: C'mon... If you learned how to play, then you, Welt, and March would only need to find one more person! You could get a table going and play a few rounds during your travels.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: We're in agreement then. You can come back any time and I'll teach you how to play.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Qingque]: We're in agreement then. You can come back any time and I'll teach you how to play.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: Hello, .
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: ...To start your next journey... That's great. *sigh* I can't wait to escape the Commission again...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: Oh, make sure you come visit! Next time you're here, we'll put my plan into action...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: I've got it all figured out. We sneak out, head over to Aurum Alley, and pig out on the snacks there!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: ...Or I could just go there myself.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: ...Hmph, I know all the best places, — you'll be lost without me.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Better start planning that escape route then.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: Mm-hmm, it's a deal.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: Aaaand don't forget to come see me if you get any headaches, fever, tendon pain, joint pain — anything! My treatment is on the house!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Bailu]: Remember to come and see me!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Are you here to say goodbye?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: There's no need to be so anxious. I predict that you will return to the Xianzhou often, and you will definitely continue to trouble us when you do.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Therefore, forget about any farewells.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Even if I do return this is still a farewell, right?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: ...Is that really everything you want to say?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: Alright, okay, I understand.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: I wish your travels be fleeting of foot, and may your crises be effortlessly resolved.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Fu Xuan]: May your travels be fleeting of foot, and may your crises be effortlessly resolved.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Is that you, big ?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: I knew it was you by the sound of your footsteps.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: It's me. I'm planning on leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: You're leaving?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Thank you for helping me... and thanks to Dan Shu too. I should be taller the next time you're back, so I won't be such a burden on everyone.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: By the way, is Dan Shu okay? Me and my friends are worried about her... We haven't heard from her since the last time she delivered the medicine.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: She's... on sabbatical studying medicinal pellets.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Oh, I understand. Making pellets must be very hard work — we shouldn't bug her.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: When I grow up, I want to be a great alchemist like Dan Shu — making medicine and helping the incomplete ones!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Well... bye-bye, big . Have a safe journey!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: She's dead.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Dead... What does "dead" mean? Does it mean, going to a really really really far away place forever and ever, and never coming back? Like my mommy and daddy?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: That's one way of putting it...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: She committed a serious crime... and was executed on the spot.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: So... Dan Shu will never come to see us again?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: The little girl stares in your direction in silence, but the look in her eyes says a lot.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Thanks for telling me, big . Like Dan Shu always said, we can't expect others to take care of us forever.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Goodbye, big .
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Xiaoyu]: Bye, big .
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: *sigh* What do we do now? We don't really have to turn over a new leaf, do we?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: No way. We pretend to obey the grownups, then get back to business as soon as we get the chance!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Hey, what are you looking at? This is our conversation, okay? Hmm... Why does this outworlder seem so familiar to me?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Hateful Kid]: Hey boss, I recognize ! 's the one who messed with us last time!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: I remember now! Last time we dealt with this one we got into big trouble!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Ah, it's you! You're the one who betrayed us, right?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: We've been ordered to change our name from "The Luofu Trio" to "The Luofu Study Club..." It's so embarrassing! Now no-one's gonna respect us anymore...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: So tell us — how much compensation are you gonna give?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm planning on leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Huh? Trying to flee?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: *sigh* Boss, let's just forget about it. Let this bad omen off the Luofu so we can get on with business.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Hateful Kid]: Just go then, what's it gotta do with us? You think we're friends or something? You wanna say goodbye to us?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Dan Shu asked me to bring you a message.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Dan Shu? Who's Dan Shu?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: She's the leader of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus — the one everyone was talking about!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: *gulp* Sanctus... Medicus? Wh—wh—what do you want with me?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Hateful Kid]: You want us to join you or something?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Stay away from Xiaoyu, y'hear? Otherwise...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Y—You guys must think you're pretty tough, bullying kids like us out in the open.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Have us arrested then.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: Time to throw in the towel boss — they're playing for real. If you wanna start a fight with the Disciples, I'm out.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Hateful Kid]: Ugh, guess you're right, these guys mean business. My mom said they eat three or four kids for breakfast!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Y—Yeah... Ahem! Hey, you — we promise not to bully Xiaoyu again, if you promise not to mess with us.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: And don't bully any other kids, either.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: That depends on your end of the bargain.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: O—O—Okay, we promise! But you have to keep your word too!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Hateful Kid]: Then as the Luofu Trio, we...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Arrogant Kid]: Shh! We're the Luofu Study Club now! Don't say anything about the Trio. You ought to be more afraid of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Mean Kid]: Good thinking, Boss! Long live the Luofu Study Club!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Woof woof!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: *whimpers*
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Rrr—ruff ruff woof! Woof woof!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I... don't understand...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: What's that? You're gonna miss me?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Woof woof! Rr—ruff!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Diting lifts its front paws, draws an arch in the air with its round head, turns around, and runs off into the distance.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: It looks like he has something to show you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Woof woof!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Is this... a gift for me!?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Woof~
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Diting circles around and sits down, expectantly wanting to see you open the chest and get something nice.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I guess a dog really is a man's best friend after all.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Thank you!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Woof!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: )
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Diting]: Woof! Woof woof!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: The Artisanship Commission has come through hell and high water since the incident. Rebuilding what we lost will drain the years, our labor filled with blood, and sweat, and tears!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'm leaving the Luofu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: For a youngster to deliver a farewell to an old man like me is a rare occurrence in this day and age.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: *sigh* I've taken on many a short-life apprentice — after leaving the Luofu, they never return. Time, not distance, is the true separator of souls.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: The lingering sound of bygone music plays, though groweth fainter with the parting ways.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Don't worry. I'll be back.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: I'm glad. I'll still be here at the Artisanship Commission. You're welcome any time.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: You sound touched, Master Gongshu.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: Life is full of farewells, and I've seen more than most.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: *sigh* But farewell it is. I shall not sing for you on your way out... I fear the sound would break my heartstrings...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Master Gongshu]: *sigh* But farewell it is. I shall not sing for you on your way out... I fear the sound would break my heartstrings...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Himeko messaged me — the Express detected the Jade Gate's re-opening. She asked whether we'd be heading back any time soon.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: She was also asking after you, Dan Heng. I think it'd be best for you to update her in person, don't you think?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: She must have been worried. I'll return to the train and put her mind at rest.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Uh, hang on. How could I forget. We should bring something back for the conductor. , have you got any unfinished business on the Xianzhou?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I'd like to visit some of the friends we made along the way...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Oh yeah, there are some people we haven't said goodbye to yet!
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Uhh... don't think so...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: I've got goldfish memory — we haven't had a chance to say goodbye to everyone we met so far on this trip.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Fine, fine. Dan Heng and I will go back to the Express. The two of you come back soon, okay?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Don't worry, Mr. Yang.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Dan Heng and I will go back to the Express first. You and March finish up here and come back soon, alright?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: We've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met — I feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][March 7th]: Who should I go to first? The Master Diviner? Qingque? The miracle doctor? Or what about Master Gongshu? *sigh* , shall we go and meet them all?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: When I left the train, I only had time to say a quick goodbye to Himeko.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Dan Heng]: I should go back and give her an update... and thank her for her guidance.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: There's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the Jade Gate. How long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: From a universal perspective, there is little difference between the lives of long and short-life species. The transcendence that the Xianzhou pursues is nothing compared to the enduring majesty of the stars. And the grief felt here... is no different from our own.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Didn't know you were a poet, Mr. Yang.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: You're back, . Himeko and I were just discussing our journey
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: This little excursion has reached its conclusion — all things must come to an end. Still, some endings spark a new beginning.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Sorry to interrupt the poetry...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: , you're back. Welt was telling me about your experiences — I'm more than a little envious! The Ambrosial Arbor, the Ebon Deer, the Divination Commission Matrix, Scalegorge Waterscape...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: I pestered Dan Heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: Next time, I think I should be the one trailblazing with you guys — Welt can stay on the Express.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: ...Since when did the work roster just change like that?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: What's our next stop?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: Penacony. Do you remember? Before Kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: So, we can warp jump as planned this time?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: Yes. No more Stellaron Hunter interruptions — it's time to get our original plan back on track. Our next stop is Penacony, remember?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Think I need a reminder...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: The Express' records show that Penacony was a prison planet used by the IPC to exile criminals... At least, it was at the time of recording.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: However, following a Stellaron burst, the planet fell into the arms of Xipe. They say it's been transformed into a prosperous and ethereal realm.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: I remember.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: The Family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the Express. I was curious about the state of the planet, so I accepted.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: When the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Narration]: Meanwhile, in The Shackling Prison...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: All who enter here...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...are either jailers...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...or prisoners.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Which are you?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Luocha]: Neither. I'm merely a lost traveler.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: What a spectacle! The Stellaron, the Ambrosial Arbor, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, the Lord Ravager...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...a series of threats...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...that almost succeeded in diverting attention away...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...from the crucial question...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: They who brought the Stellaron onto the Xianzhou...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: What was their motive?
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: Will you surrender...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...or do you require encouragement...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jing Yuan]: ...abomination of Yaoshi.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Luocha]: General, my power does indeed stem from the Abundance.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Luocha]: But I'm the same as you.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Luocha]: We are both enemies of Yaoshi.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: That's right, Jing Yuan.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: Stay out of our way.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: The revival of the Arbor is an omen. It's time for the Xianzhou to choose its next path.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: The Reignbow Arbiter, the Plagues Author, the Ruin Author...
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: This is a chess game between Aeons. If you don't stand with the winners, you stand to lose.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: And this time,
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Jingliu]: We will put the Abundance in their grave.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: Penacony is throwing a banquet — I've received an invitation from The Family.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Himeko]: When the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
[Obsequies Performed, A Long Road Ahead][Welt]: Our time on the Xianzhou has come to an end. Back to the original plan, I suppose?

[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Hey, , did you hear about our next stop? It's a world called "Penacony" — I hear it's a beautiful, dreamy place... I'm so excited...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: ...but Pom-Pom said the banquet we were invited to is still a little ways off. Hmm... what can I do to pass the time...?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: ...Huh? Is that my phone? Must be the group chat.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: That Dan Heng — he can't just ignore Bronya...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Let's go to his room and talk to him.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Dan Heng! Bronya just sent all of us a message. Did you see it yet?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Dan Heng]: Yes, I saw it.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Then why didn't you reply? Bronya's a good friend of ours!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Dan Heng]: ...I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood for idle chat. There's been a lot weighing on my mind since the Luofu... it was tough on the spirit.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Dan Heng...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: I'm the one who should be sorry — I was being too pushy! You're right, you went through a lot on the Xianzhou — take all the time you need...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Dan Heng, stay on the Express and get some rest.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Dan Heng]: Thank you for understanding, .
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Why not come with us for a change of scenery?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Dan Heng]: No, thanks — I'll be staying on the Express.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Dan Heng]: It's great that Belobog is able to host a celebration. I hope your trip goes well — say hi to our friends for me.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Okay! Rest up — you're not allowed to miss the next Trailblaze expedition!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Dan Heng]: Mm, I'll be there next time.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: He won't budge, huh? Looks like it's just the two of us then.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Pity, he's gonna miss out! We never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: He's been through a lot lately.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: I know... But it's still a shame, don't you think?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Stress-free for us, or stress-free for the planet?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Don't get yourself all worked up. If Jarilo-VI is strong enough to withstand a Stellaron, it'll be just fine.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: If only Himeko could come with us...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Should we ask Mr. Yang to come with us?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Mm, maybe not. He's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the Xianzhou. You didn't notice?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: At his age, he might not appreciate the extra... excitement.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: What about Pom-Pom?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Pom-Pom can't just leave the Express whenever they feel like it. You didn't know?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Seems like someone wasn't paying attention!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: , why don't we go ask Himeko to tag along? She might be up for an adventure!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: You've been on the Express a while now, but you've never gone on a trip with Himeko before, right? Well, now's your chance!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Himeko]: Hey, March. That's a big smile on your face — what's the good news?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Himeko! There's a celebration coming up on Jarilo-VI, organized by the Supreme Guardian, and we're invited to go take in the sights and sounds.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Dan Heng won't be going anywhere for a while — he's still resting up, so... wanna come with us?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: I mean, considering how you helped us out with Cocolia, I'm sure Bronya would be happy to see you!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Himeko]: Ahh, so that explains the grin — you're excited about the celebration.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Himeko]: Thanks for the invite, but I'm afraid my hands are full right now. Please send my regards to the Supreme Guardian.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Himeko]: Make the most of the festivities — you've earned it! You two and Dan Heng did help save Jarilo-VI, after all. I'll be sure to join you guys next time.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Navigators really do have their plates full, huh? Seems like it's just you and me this time.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Let me go pack some stuff for the trip first. , come and find me when you're ready to set off.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Himeko]: I've got a lot going on right now, but I'll try to make it next time.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Himeko]: I'm sure you'll have a great time. Don't forget to send my regards to the Supreme Guardian while you're there.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: So? What do you think about my new dress, ? Pretty neat, right?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: When did you buy it?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: It's actually not new, I just never had the right occasion to try it on.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Very fancy!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: It's been sitting in my wardrobe collecting dust for far too long. But now I've finally got the chance to wear it!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: This kind of event doesn't come around every day — why shouldn't I dress for the occasion? ...You're not really gonna wear that same old outfit... are you?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Ugh... let's just pretend I never said anything. As long as one of us is making an effort.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Pajamas, hot water bottle, Pom-Pom doll... That should be everything! Let's go!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Wow, that was fast... Don't you have anything you wanna bring with you?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Nope, just myself.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Huh, you do seem to travel light. But... don't you at least need some pajamas!?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Why are you bringing Pom-Pom doll?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Well, I thought since Pom-Pom can't leave the Express, bringing a doll with us is kind of like taking them trailblazing.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: My relics all have speed attributes.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Other people might fall for that, but I won't!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: I was just taking a look at Mr. Yang's records, and it seems that Jarilo-VI's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. It's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: I wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. I'm so happy for Bronya and Seele.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Ready to go, ?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: You bet! It's time to celebrate!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Belobog, here we come!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Actually, I think I forgot something...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: What? You're still not ready to go?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Alright slowpoke, I'll wait for you here.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Ready to go, ?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: You bet! It's time to celebrate!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Belobog, here we come!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Actually, I think I forgot something...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: What? You're still not ready to go?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Alright slowpoke, I'll wait for you here.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Belobog... 700 years...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: It's never too late...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: ...to pick up the tab.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Brr! How do people living in all this snow celebrate anything...?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: One thing's for sure though, . Where there's a celebration, there's bound to be food, right?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Come on Belobog... don't let me down.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Wait a sec, ! That person over there. That doesn't look like a Silvermane Guard uniform...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: All in black, surely they're not... IPC? On this world? Am I going crazy?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: IPC?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: The Interastral Peace Corporation — who else? The one whose insignia is pretty much everywhere? That IPC!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: You still don't remember? What about "Findie"? That's one of their products... Oh and the Interastral Peace Broadcast! Y'know, the one always being played on the Express!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Never mind, it's not that important. The important question is: What are the IPC doing on Jarilo-VI?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: What are they doing here?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: That's what I'd like to know. If they're here to look for Findie, then they're more than just a little late.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: What an ugly uniform.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: ...You think so? I actually think it's pretty snazzy.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Anyway, that's besides the point! The point is, what are the IPC doing here on Jarilo-VI?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: There's only one way to find out — let's go ask. I've always found IPC staff easy to talk to.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Hi! Do you work for the Interastral Peace Corporation? Or are you just dressing fancy today?
[Future Market (Prologue)][IPC Worker]: ...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: ...
[Future Market (Prologue)][IPC Worker]: ...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: ...?
[Future Market (Prologue)][IPC Worker]: Boss, encounter with two unknowns. Want me to take them out? Over.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: T—Take us out?!
[Future Market (Prologue)][???]: Take them out!? Just hang tight for a second, I'm on my way. Don't do anything stupid.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Glad to make your acquaintance — I'm Topaz, an investment expert from the Interastral Peace Corporation. I'm here on Jarilo-VI for a special business assignment.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: You'll have to forgive my colleague here — people skills aren't his strong suit. Please don't take it to heart.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Whew... You scared the life out of me! We're here for the celebrations — we're not looking for more conflicts...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Oh, right, we should probably introduce ourselves. I'm March 7th, a passenger of the Astral Express — you may have heard of it? And this is my friend and fellow passenger — .
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: No kidding! I could tell you weren't locals from a mile away, but I didn't expect to run into two Nameless here! Fate is such a curious thing⁓
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: I heard that Jarilo-VI only stepped out of the Stellaron's shadow thanks to the direct intervention of the Trailblazers. Surely, you two aren't...?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: That's us. The honor is yours.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Huh? Geez, can you be a little more humble?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: We may have helped out a little bit.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: So humble all of a sudden, huh? Are you feeling alright? Should I call a doctor?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: I never imagined I'd run into living legends here. Must be our lucky day, huh, Numby?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Wow, Miss Topaz, you're really young for an IPC executive! That's impressive!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: More good luck, I suppose. But it's not as cushy as you think — scurrying from one side of the galaxy to the other, going wherever businesses requires me to be...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Huh, your job sounds pretty similar to the Express crew's! Aside from the "business," I guess...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Bronya moves fast! The crisis is only just over and she's already opened talks with the IPC.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Hehe, these "talks" aren't exactly what you might expect, but I have to agree, the Supreme Guardian definitely knows how to govern a city. That's the reason I'm here on Jarilo-VI — to meet with her.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Miss March, you said you were on your way to the Belobog festivities, right? My apologies for delaying you both!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Don't be sorry! It's not like we're in a rush. Wanna come to the city with us? The Snow Plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Thanks for the concern, but I'll manage. It's my first time on this world — I'd like to take in its vast, iconic snowscape for just a little longer.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Who knows, maybe we'll cross paths again during the celebrations. Oh, here's my contact information. I don't usually respond during work hours, but I'd be happy to chat off the clock⁓
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: ...Wowwww, I actually managed to get an IPC executive's phone number without even trying.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Teach me how to get rich!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: M—Me too!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: I'm in charge of a project worth 8 billion credits, by the way.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Pfft! As if anyone would ever believe that!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Topaz]: Hahaha, you two make a cute pair! Anyway, I'd better be on my way, see you next time!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: The universe is huge, yet we somehow stumbled onto the same path. Fate truly works in mysterious ways, , don't you think?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Come on, let's head into the city!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Wow! There are people everywhere. Are you sure we're in Belobog?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Now to check out the main event — the food! C'mon , keep up!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Is that Pela? Looks like she's teaching the kids again.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Listen
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: Next, I'll be introducing the history of the museum. Everyone, listen carefully, okay?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: Belobog's History and Culture Museum was founded 600 years ago, and was originally built to memorialize Supreme Guardian Alisa...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Children]: Soooo hungry... I wish I could have a Redsunset Salmon right now...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: *cough* It was built to memorialize Supreme Guardian Alisa Rand, and also...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Children]: Guess what — I heard there's gonna be a Silvermane adventure camp opening in the Overworld soon. It's gonna be super awesome.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: ...Also, those who sacrificed their lives in the war against the invaders 700 years ago...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Children]: Miss Pela! Peter is falling asleep!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: Enough! From now on, no whispering allowed! If you don't want to have any homework later, you'd better start listening!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Children]: Sorry, Miss Pela...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: That's better. *cough* Now, where was I?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: I never knew Pela had a strict side...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Listen
[Future Market (Prologue)][Pela]: Belobog's History and Culture Museum was founded 600 years ago, and was originally built to memorialize Supreme Guardian Alisa...
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Hang on a sec, isn't that Wallace up ahead? Looks like he's finally made some friends! I wonder what they're talking about...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Listen
[Future Market (Prologue)][Wallace]: ...Norbert, why don't you tell everyone how you were released from jail so quickly?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Wallace]: Selling cultural relics and impersonating Silvermane Guards are both heinous crimes!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Norbert]: Well... it was all thanks to my uncle, you know...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Rossy]: Ahh, I remember! Your uncle is Minister Noel — he heads up the Department of Transportation, no?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Norbert]: Ahem... Yes, y—you knew that, too?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Rossy]: Haha, you're shameless, Norbert! Not to be rude, but if I were thrown in jail, I wouldn't possibly ask my father to bail me out.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Norbert]: Do you think I wanted to? I'm not the type of person to abuse my status.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Wallace]: Well, I... don't really know about that...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Norbert]: Ugh, get off my back, will you? I had to deal with hardened criminals in jail — now that I'm free my supposed "friends" are ganging up on me!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Looks like things are getting heated. I think we'd better get outta here.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Listen
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Looks like things are getting heated. I think we'd better get outta here.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: , quick! Serval's about to start singing!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Listen
[Future Market (Prologue)][Serval]: Woo! Thanks everyone! Hope you're ready for a great show! Let's get started!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Serval and Spectators]: 
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Listen
[Future Market (Prologue)][Serval and Spectators]: 
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Aunt Gertie! It's been too long!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gertie]: Ah! Is that little March!? What brings you this way? I heard you left to go travel the galaxy?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gertie]: ...Oh, you're here for the Solwarm Festival, right? The atmosphere is like no other. Silly me, where are my manners? Grab yourselves a suncake each — get 'em while they're hot!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Queuing Man]: Hey, that's not fair! Get to the back of the line. Ever heard of first come, first served?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gertie]: Tsk, show a little respect! If it weren't for these two, we'd be eating Geomarrow by now!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: Waiting for Gertie's suncakes...
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gertie]: Take a look at these beauties! These are the best suncakes I've made all day.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Wow, they smell so good! They look so crispy and crunchy! I think I'm in love!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gertie]: Well, don't wait for them to get cold now. I'm sorry sweethearts, I'd best see to these other customers before their hunger gets the better of them. Thanks for stopping by!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gertie]: Well, don't wait for them to get cold now. I'm sorry sweethearts, I'd best see to these other customers before their hunger gets the better of them. Thanks for stopping by!
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Ta-da! Guess who's back?
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: It's you two! Welcome back to Belobog.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: The Supreme Guardian mentioned there'd be mystery guests attending the Solwarm celebrations, but I didn't think it'd be the Express crew.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: I hope you had a smooth journey. I should have dispatched Silvermane Guards to welcome you on arrival — my apologies.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: It's fine! You really don't have to apologize. We're just passing through, it's no big deal.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: Understood. I hope you both enjoy the festivities.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: Please make sure you keep your personal belongings safe — pickpockets tend to take advantage of events like this. We'll be performing additional patrols.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Got it! We'll get out of your way, then. Bye!
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: Bye for now.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: The Supreme Guardian mentioned there'd be mystery guests attending the Solwarm celebrations, but I didn't think it'd be the Express crew.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Gepard]: I hope you had a smooth journey. I should have dispatched Silvermane Guards to welcome you on arrival — my apologies.
[Future Market (Prologue)][Narration]: After some time
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Whew... who'd have thought just taking a stroll could be so tiring?
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: , say, I think we should probably pay Bronya a visit. After all, she was the one who invited us here.
[Future Market (Prologue)][March 7th]: Or... we could go check out some other fun stuff elsewhere. Your call!

[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I understand the difficulties that this world is facing, Supreme Guardian. Belobog's current financial burden cannot be pinned on you, nor anyone else for that matter.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: However, objectively speaking, since Belobog has existed as an independent entity to this day, its debt cannot simply be written off.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: ...Oh, it looks like we have some visitors!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Bronya! And... Topaz? You're here too?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I guess you've already started your business talks. We'll get out of your way if—
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: It's no bother, we've pretty much wrapped things up already, anyway.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Please consider my plans carefully, Supreme Guardian. If Jarilo-VI wants to rebuild its connections with the rest of the galaxy, your credit record with the IPC will be of great importance.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: ...You've made yourself clear, Miss Topaz. I'll require some time to consider my next course of action.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Naturally. However, while you're deliberating, my colleagues will need to carry out some operations in Belobog. I hope that your subjects in the Underworld are... cooperative.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I'm sorry our business got in the way of a reunion with old friends. I'll get out of your way.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Is everything all right, Bronya? I didn't know Miss Topaz was so... intense. She seemed nice when we met her.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: It's good to see you two again, welcome back to Belobog. I'd planned a special reception, but I had to deal with an unexpected guest — the lady you just witnessed. She claims to represent the IPC...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: There's no need to keep either of you in the dark. To tell the truth, I've too much weighing on my mind right now to even think about the Solwarm Festival.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: What exactly did Miss Topaz say to you?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: I only heard the word "Debt."
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Mm... Since you've already made her acquaintance, I needn't explain who she is.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: I'm sure you heard pieces of Belobog's history the first time you visited — the Legion's invasion 700 years ago, how the Stellaron brought about the Eternal Freeze...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: It seems that much of Belobog's history from that time was buried deep beneath the snow. Those memories were lost and weren't passed down to the subsequent generations of Supreme Guardians.
[Future Market (I)][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance Future Market .mp4
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Topaz shared with me the story of the Stellaron's descent upon Jarilo-VI — how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Among those outsiders were several investors from the Interastral Peace Corporation. Before they departed, they did something noteworthy...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: They sought out Architects who refused to leave — those who insisted on defending their homes. The IPC provided these Architects with significant funds to aid them against the coming disaster.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: It was with those funds that Belobog was able to construct its immense walls... Even the initial funding for the development of the first batch of automatons was drawn from the same pool.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Wow, that's a pretty incredible story. So... does that mean Topaz's "business" here is to collect a debt from Belobog?
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Yes... I'm afraid so.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: That's ridiculous! And what's with the timing? What took them so long to get here? If it wasn't for us eliminating the Stellaron, they'd have nothing to collect! It's obvious they're just trying to take advantage.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: According to her account, the repayment period agreed upon by the Architects and the IPC investors was... 280 years. However, less than a century after the loan was taken out, the connection between Jarilo-VI and the rest of the galaxy was completely severed.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: The IPC deemed that the disaster had caused irreparable damage and that there was no civilization left to reclaim the debt from. As such, they considered the owed sum permanently lost...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: ...It wasn't until the Stellaron crisis was resolved that the IPC discovered that Belobog had survived...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: And that's when they sent Topaz over to collect the debt...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: ...And the interest.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: How much is owed?
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: An astronomical amount. I don't even know how to read such a long string of numbers.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: What happens if you don't pay it off in time?
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: The debt owed is an astronomical amount. I don't even know how to read such a long string of numbers.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Before you both arrived, Topaz warned me that if payments were delayed, the IPC would give her the authority to employ "strong measures."
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I had no idea things were like this. Here I was thinking the IPC had come to rebuild Belobog, not extort it!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Looks like we'll have to intervene.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Yeah! We have to help Bronya out! The IPC is too big and powerful — the Belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: I doubt the Belobogians can do anything about this on their own...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Right, we need to figure out how to help them. The IPC is too big and powerful — even if Bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: You seem to have a deeper knowledge of the Interastral Peace Corporation than I do, but if the records are accurate and they truly have a presence throughout the galaxy, the IPC could crush Belobog like a bug if they wanted to.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: I'm glad you're both here — I know you came for the festival, but now...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: ...Now I must ask you and the Astral Express for help. Do you think you could persuade Topaz to reevaluate the situation? The Express's reputation precedes it, perhaps there's still hope...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Have no fear, Bronya! When a friend's in need, the Nameless will always be at their side!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Let's go have a chat with Topaz.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Yeah, after all,  is a pretty good negotiator.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Let's bring out the big guns.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Uh... I don't think we're at that stage yet. Miss Topaz seems like a reasonable person.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: With 's silver tongue, I'm sure we'll make some progress.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Thank you so much, both of you. I'm so sorry for dragging you into more trouble.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: While you're out looking for Topaz, I'll see if I can think of a strategy to deal with the situation. Best of luck, and stay safe.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: , I apologize for dragging you into Belobog's affairs again, but when faced with an entity as powerful as the IPC, we need all the external help we can get.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: While you're out looking for Topaz, I'll see if I can think of a strategy to deal with the situation. Best of luck, and stay safe.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Can you tell me again why Topaz is here?
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Topaz shared with me the story of the Stellaron's descent upon Jarilo-VI — how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Among those outsiders were several investors from the Interastral Peace Corporation. Before they departed, they did something noteworthy...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: They sought out Architects who refused to leave — those who insisted on defending their homes. The IPC provided these Architects with significant funds to aid them against the coming disaster.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: It was with those funds that Belobog was able to construct its immense walls... Even the initial funding for the development of the first batch of automatons was drawn from the same pool.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: According to her account, the repayment period agreed upon by the Architects and the IPC investors was... 280 years. However, less than a century after the loan was taken out, the connection between Jarilo-VI and the rest of the galaxy was completely severed.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: The IPC deemed that the disaster had caused irreparable damage and that there was no civilization left to reclaim the debt from. As such, they considered the owed sum permanently lost...
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: ...It wasn't until the Stellaron crisis was resolved that the IPC discovered that Belobog had survived...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: We'll do our best.
[Future Market (I)][Bronya]: Thank you, . I believe in you.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: , I just remembered Topaz gave me her number.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: We might as well just be direct and ask her where she is. She seems like the type of person who appreciates a straight approach.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Okay, got it. She's at the museum — let's get going.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: We better think about what we're gonna say. She might be young, but she is an IPC executive — she's definitely no pushover.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: 600 years old
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Provisional evaluation would value it at approximately 270,000...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: With 34 of this type of painting...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: That comes to 9,180,000...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Oh! It's you two again. This is the third time today we've run into each other.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Cherish the moment...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Why, of course I will! Meeting friends from the Astral Express is always a moment worth cherishing!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Actually, we sent you a message.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Oh, did my Smart-Reply function tell you where I was? It's a system developed by the Technology Department. Pretty neat, right?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: What do you make of this painting? I'm no expert, but just from the artist's strokes I can tell it's no ordinary piece.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: It portrays a certain kind of... sorrow, you know? Not your everyday kind of sadness — it runs much deeper than that.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: It's as if the artist has condensed history into one poignant, but sorrowful image. The artist's brushwork depicts a generation's — no, several generations' hardships...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Seems like you know your art...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Not at all, the analysis of an aficionado. I wouldn't take my word for it.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: The Express has visited many worlds. I'm sure the Nameless have a far greater knowledge of such things than myself.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: I was thinking the exact same thing.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Haha, you flatter me! The Express has visited many worlds. I'm sure the Nameless have a far greater knowledge of such things than myself.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I suppose what I'm trying to say is, what I'm drawn to isn't the style in which a piece is painted, but its overall value. Its intrinsic value may only be 50,000 credits, but its "added value" might push the total up to 200,000.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Ugh... Sorry for crashing your artist party, but we came to talk to you about something else...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Oh? A collaboration between our two sides, perhaps?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Not exactly. Actually, we—
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Let's walk and talk — this way!
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Most exhibits in this museum are of little value.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: But with a keen eye, it's possible to find a diamond in the rough, so to speak.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Miss Topaz, Bronya's already told us about Belobog's debt situation...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: ...Oh? You two are closer than I expected with her.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: So, how can I help? Not sure on the arrangement, or...?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: We... Uh... Help me out here, ! You know I'm not good at this kinda thing...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: We want to ask for a favor on behalf of Bronya.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I see.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: The IPC's demands are unreasonable.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: You're so direct — I like that!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: The Express will pay off Belobog's outstanding debts!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Hey! Nobody agreed to that!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Ahem. We're actually here on behalf of Bronya. It's just, you know... Given Belobog's circumstances, it isn't exactly awash with money right now. The Belobogians don't have the means to pay off such a huge debt.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I understand. From your point of view, I can see how unreasonable it appears.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: However, you must understand that debt collection is a big part of my job. I've dealt with cases far more difficult than Belobog's.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I appreciate each case has its difficulties, but if I treated every late debtor as a "special case," the galaxy's economy would come to a grinding halt.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: What a heartless way of seeing things...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Haha~ I've heard that before — more than a few times, actually.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: ...And if the debt can't be repaid?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: The Strategic Investment Department is well-versed in handling such situations. We can offer the debtor various repayment solutions...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: ...but Jarilo-VI has far exceeded the allotted repayment period. I'm afraid milder solutions aren't the order of the day. So, I proposed to Bronya...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Oops! I almost gave away trade secrets there, didn't I? That was a close one.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: The exhibits here are pretty ordinary — I estimate they're probably not worth much. Let's keep moving.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: So you're basically saying the Belobogians must pay off their ancestors' debts...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: When you think about it, it's just another part of the cycle of life.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: ...Uh, I'm not sure it's as poetic as that...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Wow, look! Is that little critter native to Jarilo-VI!?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: It's so white and fluffy! Where can I find a live one?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: You like animals?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I absolutely adore them! Have you guys met Numby yet? Aw, where'd they go? They must be off playing somewhere.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Hmm... Come to think of it, this little guy's on display here probably means it's already extinct... right?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: It's probably extinct.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I suppose it probably is. Otherwise, it wouldn't be on display here.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: That's such a shame! I absolutely adore little animals! Have you guys met Numby yet? I guess they're off playing somewhere.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: So, Miss Topaz, what exactly will it take for the IPC to go easier on Belobog?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. And now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. It's just so cruel...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: What do you take the IPC for, Miss March? We're just the same as Belobog's Architects — we're all followers of the Preservation.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: No matter what solutions we propose, we will always take the welfare of the people of Belobog into consideration. Otherwise, we'd be no different from the Legion, would we?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: So you're saying there's nothing to worry about? But Bronya...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Don't worry yourself too much. The Supreme Guardian is a wise person. She'll understand.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: But to answer your question directly — it'd take a miracle. I'll complete the Jarilo-VI project no matter what obstacles I encounter.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: This isn't going as planned... What should we do?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I wouldn't waste too much energy on this matter. Why not make the most of the festive atmosphere...?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Oh, looks like one of my colleagues is after me. My apologies, but I should probably take this. Bye!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: So... what now? We spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: We didn't promise Bronya we'd succeed.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Well, yeah, but she'll be really disappointed...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: She sort of made sense...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I guess so, but that still doesn't fix Bronya's problem...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: We should keep pestering her.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: You sure? I really don't think she'll change her mind.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I guess Miss Topaz is just doing her job. And as far as the Express is concerned, I think it'd be unwise to make the IPC our enemy.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: All these vested interests — so hard to undo any of it... they teach this stuff in school. Wait... did I even go to school?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Did someone send you a message?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Huh? The IPC are causing trouble in the Underworld? Already?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Ugh, seriously? Topaz was just talking about "taking the welfare of the people of Belobog into consideration," and now they're pulling this stunt? You really can't trust these money-hungry IPC suits for a minute!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Let's go save the day.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Again... I don't think I have it in me to play the hero today!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Here we go again...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I really did jinx us! I don't think I have it in me to play the hero today!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: That's right! You can't believe a word they say!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I really did jinx us! I don't think I have it in me to play the hero today!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I guess complaining won't get us anywhere. Let's go lend them a hand.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Seele!
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Hey! Am I glad to see you two here — I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: What's going on?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: It's bad — really bad. Their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Nobody's been seriously hurt, but a few Wildfire members got minor injuries. Fortunately for us, it seems like they were holding back.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Is anyone hurt?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Nobody's been seriously hurt, but a few Wildfire members got minor injuries. Fortunately for us, it seems like they were holding back.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: You see those two in black? They've been guarding the mine entrance — they're not letting anyone in or out. Hey! Just because you have fancy equipment doesn't mean you can bully us! Who do you think you are?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: What's the matter? Got nothing to say!?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: What's going on inside the mine? Any ideas?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: A few miners made it out earlier — they looked pretty panicked. They said the whole mine had been seized by the people in black.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: These uninvited guests keep talking about "asset evaluation," whatever that means. All I know is they're seriously disrupting the lives of the Underworlders!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Is Topaz around?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Who?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: We were just talking to her in the museum... Do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: We'll handle this.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Do you think Topaz is around here somewhere? Maybe her cronies are acting without her authorization...
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: The person you're talking about — are they in charge of the people in black?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Potaz, Pazto — whatever her name is, she can wait. Right now, the most important thing is to free those trapped in the Great Mine. Are you two with me?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Hey, you two! Cat got your tongue or something? If you knew what was best for you, you'd get out of my way!
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: ...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: You guys must be exhausted standing here all day. How about you take a little lunch break — I'm sure the IPC allows that, right?
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: I'm a guest of your boss, stand aside.
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Seriously, get some lunch bro.
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: ...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Ugh, what's their deal?
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: You two were talking to the director in the Snow Plains...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Huh!? So it's you! You're the one who was threatening to take us out in the Snow Plains!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Hmph, do you even know who you're talking to? If your boss knows to treat us with respect, you'd better start showing some yourself!
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: I can't let you pass! My team leader said that if anyone gets through, I'll lose six months of performance bonuses!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Team leader? Ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than I thought.
[Future Market (I)][Quiet Worker]: Sh—Shut up! I spent seven years on a forsaken asteroid preparing to join the IPC — I went through 17 interviews before they finally hired me... What right do you deadbeats have to criticize me!?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: ...IPC? Interviews!? I don't know what you're rambling on about, but you're really testing my patience.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: , March — no need to waste our breath on this idiot. Let's do this!
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: That's it? He sure took off quickly.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: 17 rounds of interviews and these are the best people they can find? What a joke.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I've been warned that the ones in the mine won't go down without a fight.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: , let's set off when you're ready.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Caught your breath yet, ? It's time to show these IPC fools who they're dealing with!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: When did you change your clothes?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: ...Right after we finished chatting with Topaz in the museum.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Did it take you that long to notice, ? I thought you were supposed to be the observant one!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: I didn't think we'd have to fight again...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Nobody did, but it never hurts to be prepared!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Just when I thought I could catch a break, things go haywire! Guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: The quicker we handle the IPC, the faster we can get back to enjoying the celebrations. Let Seele know when you're ready to go.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Ready for action? It's time to kick the IPC out of the Underworld.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Let's go.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Let's get moving!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Not just yet.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Mm, make sure you've got everything you need.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Mission Description's Trailblaze Daily Report:Lots of miners look dazed. Need to chat with them. Great Mine
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Meanwhile, at Svarog's settlement...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Hello — it's Mr. Svarog, isn't it? And this cute little girl must be Clara!
[Future Market (I)][Clara]: H—Hello Miss... Are you...?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I'm Topaz! I've come to have a chat with Mr. Svarog.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Clara, go inside and wait for me.
[Future Market (I)][Clara]: Huh? But if you have a guest, maybe I should...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: She is not a "guest," neither is she a friend.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Go, Clara. Everything will be fine.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: So, it seems my source was right: Who'd have thought such a strong bond could exist between a giant robot and a little girl...? So heartwarming!
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: You bear the insignia of the Interastral Peace Corporation. What is your motive for coming here?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Straight to the point, huh? I like your style.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Jarilo-VI — are robots familiar with that term? Anyway, it refers to the planet we're currently standing on. It's about to become the property of the IPC.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: No one can reverse this outcome. Not you, not the Nameless, nor any power in the galaxy.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I only care about one thing right now — demonstrating to the shareholders of the IPC that Jarilo-VI can generate value.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: In the long run, this is a way — the ONLY way — to ensure Belobog's long-term interests. I need your help to achieve this goal.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: "Long-term interests" undefined. Analyzing objectives...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Analysis: failed. Tell me, emissary — how do you plan to convince the IPC leadership?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: That's simple, I'll show you.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: This is...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Source code. Or to be more precise — source code that is able to take control of all mechanized units in Belobog.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I'm sure you're familiar with this — all mechanized units manufactured in Belobog over the last 700 years utilize the underlying systems created by the IPC. The code is so refined that the engineers never saw any reason to change it.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I assume you're also aware that there was once a large automaton factory in the Underworld. Thousands upon thousands of automatons — enough to crush the Legion's vanguard — lay dormant within.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: This is my bargaining chip for negotiating with the higher-ups. I'll convince them that Jarilo-VI has a place in the company's long-term strategies.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: But first, I need a guide to show me where these automatons are buried.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: I understand. Your "long-term interests" can be defined as the survival of civilization at a macro level.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: What are your intentions for the people currently living here?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Their future has already been purchased. All I can do is make them accept this fact, using a relatively peaceful approach.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: I understand. I will assist you with your plan.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: ...Oh? So, you're not as stubborn as the rumors suggest.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: The future you speak of is beyond my computational range. But my emotional analysis indicates that you are indeed trying to find ways to ensure the survival of this world.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Additionally, calculations indicate a 96.4% probability of compliance through force if I refuse to cooperate.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Your calculations are slightly on the conservative side.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Here's to our future cooperation! If you wouldn't mind leading the way, Mr. Svarog.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Meanwhile, in the Great Mine with Seele and the Trailblazer...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: All the miners here huddled together... anyone else getting déjà vu?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Well, the situation here is pretty similar to when you first arrived. It's just that instead of a few thugs and broken robots, now we're dealing with much more formidable adversaries.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Hey, , check it out! Isn't that Topaz's little trotter over there? What was it again... Numby, right?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: What!? Isn't that thing a Fragmentum monster? She's keeping one as a pet!?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: The IPC are all about their sci-fi sorcery, so it's not that surprising. Wanna go take a look?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Step Description's Trailblaze Daily Report:Trotter! Trotter! Little~ Trotter! Great Mine
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: ...Oink?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Oink.
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink... Grunt, oink?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: ...Oink?
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink! Oink oink!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Oink... Grunt, grunt, oink!
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink? Oink, oink... Grunt!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: ...Sounds like you two are getting along! What's Numby saying?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: "Topaz isn't here."
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Seriously!? You actually speak trotter?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: "Life is ultimately meaningless."
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Wow, that's soooo deep... Come on, stop fooling around!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Not sure, strong accent.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I should've known... Don't quit your day job.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Look, you guys. Looks like it wants to leave.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Looks like they want to find their master. Let's follow them, .
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Step Description's Trailblaze Daily Report:The Trotter seems to be leading the way for us. Follow it for now. Great Mine
[Future Market (I)][Fleeing Miner]: H-Help! Those people dressed in black are attacking us!
[Future Market (I)][Bossy Worker]: ...Hey, I'm talking to you! Where do you guys store the Geomarrow?
[Future Market (I)][Timid Miner]: I—I really don't know anything!
[Future Market (I)][Bossy Worker]: Tsk, this place is filled with nothing but incompetents...
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Those cowards! I guess they wanna do this the hard way!
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink! Oink, oink!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Huh? Looks like Numby's in a good mood.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: ...But aren't they on the IPC's side? Strange...
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink... Oink! Oink!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Look — that big guy down there — is he the one in charge?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Hmph! We'll see who's really in charge. Let's go!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Step Description's Trailblaze Daily Report:Found the IPC's rascals. Little Trotter was pretty useful. Time to smash. Great Mine
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Huh? Where'd Numby go?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Wow, for something so short and stubby, he's pretty nimble.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Well, I guess that's that. We're on our own now. Let's keep going.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Hey, you! Are you in charge around here?
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: A local? The IPC is currently conducting asset evaluation work here. Local residents are advised to follow those responsible for evacuation to the—
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Don't lie to us! You seized the mine by force for yourself — you drove the locals out of their homes!
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: I'm warning you — get lost or suffer the consequences! Don't you dare show your face around here again!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: And who might you be? You have quite the attitude... This is our jurisdiction now — we are all-powerful here.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Topaz just lets you do whatever you want?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: I want to speak to your boss!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Yeah! We demand to speak with Topaz!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: You know Topaz? Interesting...
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: It doesn't matter. The Strategic Investment Department has no obligation to talk to anyone not related to this project!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: In cases where debtors fail to repay within the set time frame, the IPC reserves the right to skip negotiations and take over all assets. We're simply following the rules — what exactly is your problem?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Y'know, it's funny how the "rules" always seem to work in your favor, don't you think? This world's been hanging by a thread and now you're here to pull the plug on it!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Hmph, don't blame me, I'm simply following orders. Do you think I get to make those kinds of decisions?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Save your breath, March. I never held out any hope of resolving this problem peacefully.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Didn't you claim the IPC was all-powerful? Well now's the perfect chance to show us what you can do!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Ugh, if I knew things were going to get this heated, I'd have applied for overtime...
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Ahem... Anyway! Since you seem intent on settling this matter with violence, prepare yourselves for my heavy laser cannon!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Ugh... Wh—Who are you people? Not even our tech could take you down...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Pfft! We took down the Doomsday Beast, the Stellaron, and Phantylia. Did you really think YOU could stop us?
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Darn it! I'm all out of ammo...
[Future Market (I)][Nervous Worker]: Sir, we've just received word from the director...
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Director Topaz? What did she say?
[Future Market (I)][Nervous Worker]: Teams are not to disrupt the lives of local inhabitants during the asset evaluation period...
[Future Market (I)][Nervous Worker]: Teams that violate this directive will have their year-end bonuses reduced by 60%...
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: 60%!? We're done for!
[Future Market (I)][Team Leader]: Attention all personnel. Evacuate the mine immediately! Erase all traces of your presence!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Phew... So are we all good here, or what?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Yeah. Judging by the looks on their faces, I don't think they'll be back.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: So who is this "Topaz" anyway? She seems to have no problem ordering these idiots around, or taming Fragmentum creatures, for that matter...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: It's a long story...
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: You're better off asking Bronya.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Belobog is in debt...
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Debt? What do you mean?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: You should probably ask Bronya to explain it to you.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Why did this mess have to happen so close to the festivities? The timing couldn't have been any worse.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: ...Oh! Looks like we've got a message.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Hmm... I get the feeling Bronya's worried about something. We'd better go back and see her, .
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Are you coming with us, Seele?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Go on without me, I still have stuff to take care of. The miners need to know what happened here.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Bronya messaged you, which means she thinks you can help. I trust her judgment.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Got it, Seele. We'll do what we can to help Bronya out.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Come on, , to Qlipoth Fort.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Meanwhile in Rivet Town...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: These guys... don't look pleased to see us.
[Future Market (I)][Gepard]: By order of the Supreme Guardian, proceed no further, Miss Topaz.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Belobog might be in arrears, but I'm out of pocket.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: See you later, Captain!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Meanwhile, at Svarog's settlement...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Hello — it's Mr. Svarog, isn't it? And this cute little girl must be Clara!
[Future Market (I)][Clara]: H—Hello Miss... Are you...?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I'm Topaz! I've come to have a chat with Mr. Svarog.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Clara, go inside and wait for me.
[Future Market (I)][Clara]: Huh? But if you have a guest, maybe I should...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: She is not a "guest," neither is she a friend.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Go, Clara. Everything will be fine.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: So, it seems my source was right: Who'd have thought such a strong bond could exist between a giant robot and a little girl...? So heartwarming!
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: You bear the insignia of the Interastral Peace Corporation. What is your motive for coming here?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Straight to the point, huh? I like your style.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Jarilo-VI — are robots familiar with that term? Anyway, it refers to the planet we're currently standing on. It's about to become the property of the IPC.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: No one can reverse this outcome. Not you, not the Nameless, nor any power in the galaxy.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I only care about one thing right now — demonstrating to the shareholders of the IPC that Jarilo-VI can generate value.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: In the long run, this is a way — the ONLY way — to ensure Belobog's long-term interests. I need your help to achieve this goal.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: "Long-term interests" undefined. Analyzing objectives...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Analysis: failed. Tell me, emissary — how do you plan to convince the IPC leadership?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: That's simple, I'll show you.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: This is...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Source code. Or to be more precise — source code that is able to take control of all mechanized units in Belobog.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I'm sure you're familiar with this — all mechanized units manufactured in Belobog over the last 700 years utilize the underlying systems created by the IPC. The code is so refined that the engineers never saw any reason to change it.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: I assume you're also aware that there was once a large automaton factory in the Underworld. Thousands upon thousands of automatons — enough to crush the Legion's vanguard — lay dormant within.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: This is my bargaining chip for negotiating with the higher-ups. I'll convince them that Jarilo-VI has a place in the company's long-term strategies.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: But first, I need a guide to show me where these automatons are buried.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: I understand. Your "long-term interests" can be defined as the survival of civilization at a macro level.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: What are your intentions for the people currently living here?
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Their future has already been purchased. All I can do is make them accept this fact, using a relatively peaceful approach.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: ...
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: I understand. I will assist you with your plan.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: ...Oh? So, you're not as stubborn as the rumors suggest.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: The future you speak of is beyond my computational range. But my emotional analysis indicates that you are indeed trying to find ways to ensure the survival of this world.
[Future Market (I)][Svarog]: Additionally, calculations indicate a 96.4% probability of compliance through force if I refuse to cooperate.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Your calculations are slightly on the conservative side.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Here's to our future cooperation! If you wouldn't mind leading the way, Mr. Svarog.
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Meanwhile, in the Great Mine with Seele and the Trailblazer...
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: All the miners here huddled together... anyone else getting déjà vu?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Well, the situation here is pretty similar to when you first arrived. It's just that instead of a few thugs and broken robots, now we're dealing with much more formidable adversaries.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Hey, , check it out! Isn't that Topaz's little trotter over there? What was it again... Numby, right?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: What!? Isn't that thing a Fragmentum monster? She's keeping one as a pet!?
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: The IPC are all about their sci-fi sorcery, so it's not that surprising. Wanna go take a look?
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: ...Oink?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Oink.
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink... Grunt, oink?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: ...Oink?
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink! Oink oink!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Oink... Grunt, grunt, oink!
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink? Oink, oink... Grunt!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: ...Sounds like you two are getting along! What's Numby saying?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: "Topaz isn't here."
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Seriously!? You actually speak trotter?
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: "Life is ultimately meaningless."
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Wow, that's soooo deep... Come on, stop fooling around!
[Future Market (I)][Narration]: Not sure, strong accent.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: I should've known... Don't quit your day job.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Look, you guys. Looks like it wants to leave.
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Looks like they want to find their master. Let's follow them, .
[Future Market (I)][Fleeing Miner]: H-Help! Those people dressed in black are attacking us!
[Future Market (I)][Bossy Worker]: ...Hey, I'm talking to you! Where do you guys store the Geomarrow?
[Future Market (I)][Timid Miner]: I—I really don't know anything!
[Future Market (I)][Bossy Worker]: Tsk, this place is filled with nothing but incompetents...
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Those cowards! I guess they wanna do this the hard way!
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink! Oink, oink!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Huh? Looks like Numby's in a good mood.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: ...But aren't they on the IPC's side? Strange...
[Future Market (I)][Numby]: Oink... Oink! Oink!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Look — that big guy down there — is he the one in charge?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Hmph! We'll see who's really in charge. Let's go!
[Future Market (I)][March 7th]: Huh? Where'd Numby go?
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Wow, for something so short and stubby, he's pretty nimble.
[Future Market (I)][Seele]: Well, I guess that's that. We're on our own now. Let's keep going.

[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: These guys... don't look pleased to see us.
[Future Market (I)][Gepard]: By order of the Supreme Guardian, proceed no further, Miss Topaz.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: Belobog might be in arrears, but I'm out of pocket.
[Future Market (I)][Topaz]: See you later, Captain!

[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Welcome back. I appreciate your help more than I can express — it couldn't have been easy running all over the city.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: That's what friends are for, Bronya! ...You don't sound like yourself. Is something wrong?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I'm fine, I just... I haven't rested in a while. There's just too much happening all at once...
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I'm sure we can turn things around.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You couldn't have foreseen all this.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Perhaps, but the IPC won't wait for me to catch up.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: They're moving quickly. Belobog is crawling with their agents — all they talk about is "asset evaluation."
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The silver lining is that apart from the mine incident you mentioned, there haven't been any major conflicts in other areas. I suppose Topaz must have issued an order against harassing the citizenry.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Still, that hasn't stopped panic from building... People are confused — they don't know where these strangers in black came from, nor what their intentions are.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Did you manage to get in touch with Topaz again? We're curious to know what solution she has in mind...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: That's the reason I asked for you to come here. I need your advice.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Look...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: It's...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ...The contract Topaz sent to me a little while ago. There's a handwritten letter attached.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Please, take a look at the contents... and then tell me your thoughts.
[Future Market (II)][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance Future Market .mp4
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Miss Bronya — if you'll permit me to call you that — I'd like to share a story with you from my own life.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: In your eyes, the IPC may seem heartless or cruel, but in reality, we all have a story to tell. As for myself, I was born on a small, unremarkable planet at the edge of the galaxy — a place whose name is known only to the native inhabitants.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: My home planet was extremely resource-poor. To survive, people worked laboriously, manufacturing products for other civilizations in the galaxy — mostly in the chemical or heavy industries.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Given these circumstances, the natural environment of my home planet became increasingly harsh. I don't recall the exact moment when it happened, but people started wearing respirators just to walk down the street. All you could hear were the wheezing coughs of the people — day and night.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: My home was facing its demise. The relatively wealthy chose interstellar migration and started anew. The majority who stayed could only struggle on amidst sewage, acid rain, and dust, waiting for the end.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Finally, one fateful day, the IPC arrived on my home planet. They had the technology to repair our planet's damaged environment. In return for their help, they asked for just one thing — that all inhabitants sign a contract which would make them employees of the IPC.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Two years after signing the contract, the dark clouds and haze disappeared, and people began to take off their masks. After three years, vegetation and trees began to grow and thrive again. After five years, many animals — previously on the brink of extinction — reappeared.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: When I was finally old enough, I officially became a member of the Strategic Investment Department. I witnessed the changes that took place on my home world and was determined to bring the same changes to many other worlds in the galaxy that were experiencing the same plight.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I am writing to you, Miss Bronya, with the genuine desire to express something important...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I know freedom is precious to people, but in reality there are things of much greater value... such as survival.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: How many generations of Belobogians will it take to embrace the stars again without assistance? Who can guarantee that every future Guardian will be as prudent and enlightened as you? How can you guarantee that a disaster such as the Stellaron Crisis will not descend upon Belobog yet again?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I have already negotiated the best possible deal for you. Once you sign this contract, all of Belobog's debts will be forgiven. In addition, the IPC will set up a special team to support the reconstruction of Jarilo-VI.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I can understand that for you, this is an extremely difficult decision, because you, and you alone will bear the fate of all Belobogians.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: But because of this, I believe that you will make the right decision — a decision that will truly benefit your people.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Her words do sound quite sincere... What do you make of it, ?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I think so, too.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I'm inclined to agree... It's hard to imagine she wrote that letter just to deceive me.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: She has a way with words.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Yes... she is a high-ranking member of the IPC, after all. She knows how to use words to her advantage.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: She's a smooth talker, but that doesn't mean she's telling the truth.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I agree, but it struck me as an honest letter — I found the contents quite moving. It's hard to imagine she'd write something like this just to deceive me.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: In any case, she wasn't wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: This planet's fate, the civilization it carries, everything that has happened here and everything that will happen... it all rests in my hands...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: This definitely can't — and shouldn't — be a decision made by me alone.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Perhaps you should gain some insight from others first?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: That thought has crossed my mind, and it comforts me to hear you say that, .
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Right? I don't think it's fair for you to carry the weight alone. Why not discuss it with others first?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I trust your judgment more than anyone else's.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I trust her judgment too, but...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: What if this decision is too much for one person? The impact of this choice could haunt Bronya for the rest of her life.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Topaz hasn't given me much time to consider. She wants me to decide as soon as possible.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I wanted to put it to a vote, and let all citizens of both the Overworld and the Underworld have their say. But with such little time, I'm afraid that's a lost cause.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I'll convene the Qlipoth Fort Architects immediately to discuss the contract. As for the locals, I'd like you to gauge their stance on the matter.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The people of Belobog hold both of you in high regard. They'll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: It's time to race against the clock.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Yes, we need to move fast.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Do I have voting rights?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I... think we should leave this matter to the Belobogians... Don't you agree?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: We've got your back! We failed to convince Topaz, but this should be a piece of cake!
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Thank you, March. I'll assemble the ministers. Let's meet up again here later.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Alright, if we want to make an informed decision, we need to hear from both the Overworld and the Underworld, right?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Let's start with the Overworld.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: Well, well, look who we have here!  and March, paying us a visit. What's the occasion?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: We need your opinion on an important matter.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: Uh-oh, sounds like something serious is happening. You'd better fill me in.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Serval about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: ...What? How is that possible? I need a moment to wrap my head around this...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Serval, we're racing against the clock! No time for head-wrapping.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: ...It's okay, I've thought it through... If it were up to me, I'd... sign the contract.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: What!? Hold on, are you serious? I thought you'd be against it for sure!
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: Surprised? My reasons are pretty simple.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: Signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." For most of the residents here, especially those in the Underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: As for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? If the IPC tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: You know, I've always longed for the stars since I was a child, which is why I devoted myself to science and the studying of the Stellaron. If someone told me that I could do whatever research I wanted, with only a small price to pay... I probably wouldn't hesitate.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I see... I suppose that makes sense.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Thanks for your input. I'll make a note of your opinion.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: I've always longed for the stars since I was a child, which is why I devoted myself to science and the studying of the Stellaron. If someone told me that I could do whatever research I wanted, with only a small price to pay... I probably wouldn't hesitate.
[Future Market (II)][Serval]: I can't speak for everyone, but this is how I really feel.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: We meet again! How have you two been?
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Uh-oh... That look on 's face tells me something's wrong. I hope it's nothing too serious.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: We need your opinion on an important matter.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Sounds serious. I'm all ears.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Pela about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Really...? You better not be making things up!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I wish it were made up... Unfortunately it's all true.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: We don't have much time, Pela! Bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Wait, you're telling me I have to make this huge decision on the spot? At least give me a few seconds to think it over.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Okay, I think I've got it.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: If it were up to me... I'd probably agree to the IPC's conditions.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Huh, okay... Any particular reason?
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: I've looked at some of the climate reports, and based on the data I've seen, it'll take three or four more generations for the snow to completely subside.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: And that's assuming no other disasters occur. I care more about those in the present than a future I can't be sure of.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: If the IPC is able to bring about immediate change, then I think that's a price well worth paying.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Building a better world for future generations sound great, right? But is it any fun for the engineers and Architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I see. So compared to a distant and uncertain future, what you really care about is making sure the people around you have a good life...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Thanks for your input. I'll make a note of your opinion.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: If the IPC is able to bring about immediate change, then I think that's a price well worth paying.
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: Building a better world for future generations sound great, right? But is it any fun for the engineers and Architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?
[Future Market (II)][Pela]: I'm not sure how much weight my opinion carries, but that's my take on the matter.
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: Is that  and Miss March? It's been a while! I didn't think you'd be back in Belobog so soon.
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: It's been pretty hectic in the city lately. All these people dressed in black suddenly showed up, and even the Silvermane Guards have had trouble dealing with them...
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: We need your opinion on an important matter.
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: You need my opinion? Happy to help.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Dunn about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: ...So that's who they are. Huh, it's worse than I imagined.
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: The Madam Guardian must be under a lot of pressure... Is there really nothing we can do to assist her?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: We're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. I know is this a little sudden, but we're running out of time. What's your take?
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: Why, I'd refuse the contract, of course! There is no room for compromise!
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: Just look at them — arrogant, stomping around here as if they own the place. How can such people be trusted? Who's to say they won't breach the contract?
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: Faced with this sort of coercion, we must resist them with all our might! Surrendering is not an option!
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: You must warn the Madam Guardian not to allow herself to fall into their trap!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: A soldier's perspective is always valuable, Dunn.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Thanks for your input. I'll make a note of your opinion.
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: Faced with this sort of coercion, we must resist them with all our might! Surrendering is not an option!
[Future Market (II)][Dunn]: You must warn the Madam Guardian not to allow herself to fall into their trap!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Did we miss anyone in the Overworld? I think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: From what I've gathered, it seems like most people in the Overworld are leaning towards signing the IPC's contract.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: We'd better hurry to the Underworld and see what Natasha and Seele make of it all...
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: Miss March, , what brings you two to the Underworld? And why the long face?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: We need your opinion on an important matter.
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: Seems a little out of the blue, but since you came all this way, it must be urgent. Go ahead.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Natasha about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: That's a lot of information to take in. Sorry, both of you — I know you're in a hurry, but I need a moment to think.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: No stress, Nat. Just tell us what you really think.
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: I've thought about it, and... Well, if I were Bronya, I wouldn't sign it.
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: I won't deny, the offer on the table is a very tempting one... and if we refuse, Belobog will not only have the burden of a huge debt — we may also incite the wrath of a very powerful force...
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: ...but even so, a quote I read back in school came to me just now: "Those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither."
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: Living in the Underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. I'd rather trek through the frigid Snow Plains than live in a beautiful cage.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: ...Wow, that's a pretty convincing argument...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Another vote for the against pile. Thanks for your insight, Nat.
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: "Those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither."
[Future Market (II)][Natasha]: I hope Bronya takes these words seriously.
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Miss March,  ! What brings you to the Underworld?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Hey there, Clara! Huh? Is Svarog not around?
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Mr. Svarog went out for a walk with a lady called Topaz...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: What!? Topaz!? Do you know where they went?
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: I'm not sure... but Mr. Svarog promised he'd be back soon...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Ugh! What now, ? Svarog's super logical, we should definitely get his opinion...
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: At least Clara's here.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Clara's opinion is just as important!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: True. Dan Heng's always saying that Clara's really insightful for her age.
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Huh? Miss March, do you want to ask me something?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Clara about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Uhh... That's complicated... I don't know what to say...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: It's alright, Clara, no pressure. Just tell us how you feel about it.
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: I... I think if we have a choice for the future, it should be everyone's decision.
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Because... when I was playing with Hook, The Moles, and the other kids... We talked about our dreams...
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Everyone has different dreams. If we accept Miss Topaz's offer, then doesn't that mean our dreams will never come true?
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Just taking away people's dreams like that... I don't know... It feels wrong.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: You're right. Children see the world as a place where anything is possible...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: ...just the thought of our lives being predestined from birth makes me shiver!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Thanks, Clara. Your thoughts mean a lot to us.
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: I think if we have a choice for the future, it should be everyone's decision.
[Future Market (II)][Clara]: Hook, Julian and The Moles all have different dreams. I don't think anyone should take them away.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: None other than the saviors of Belobog! To what do I owe the pleasure? To be honest, I'm surprised you even remembered an old geezer like me!
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: But... I can tell by the look on your faces you're probably not dropping by to say hi.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: We need your opinion on an important matter.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: Let me guess — something to do with these unruly people in black showing up everywhere?
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: Well, ask away! It just so happens I'm curious about them myself. Maybe I can be of some help.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Oleg about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: I see...
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: ...That's a tricky situation alright... a lot for anyone to handle, let alone someone as young as Lady Bronya.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Mr. Oleg, out of all the people we know in Belobog, you have the most life experience. What do you think we should do?
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: Wanna hear the truth? I'm afraid great ambitions and lofty plans no longer hold much appeal for an old-timer like me.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: If this "IPC" does indeed possess the magical power to restore Belobog back to its former self overnight, then I think the answer is clear.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: Have you considered the opposite? What about if we refuse? The reconstruction plan already sounds like an endless endeavor. With the added burden of a massive debt... How's that something we can manage on our own?
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: What worries me most is how Lady Bronya will handle the backlash from her people. Will she be able to withstand the criticism? Is she prepared to carry the weight of a tarnished reputation for years to come?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Bronya... "The Last Supreme Guardian..."
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Huh, I guess I never looked at it from that angle... I wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I think she can handle a little criticism.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I think so too. But could you imagine having to hear names like "The Traitorous Ruler" for the rest of your life?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Thank you for your thoughts, Mr. Oleg. Another vote for the "for" pile.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: The truth is, great ambitions and lofty plans no longer hold much appeal for an old-timer like me.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: If this "IPC" does indeed possess the magical power to restore Belobog back to its former self overnight, then I think the answer is clear.
[Future Market (II)][Oleg]: But that's just my personal opinion. In the end, it's all up to Lady Bronya.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: After collecting more citizen opinions, the final result remains a tie...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Whew... All that running around has worn me out.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: So, the final conclusion is...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: ...The votes are completely even! Ugh, I don't know what to do — both sides have really compelling arguments.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: There's still one person left to ask.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Right! We haven't asked Seele!
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Only Bronya can make the final call.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Wait a minute, we forgot to ask Seele! Let's go see what she has to say.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: She's probably still in the Great Mine helping the miners. Come on, let's get going!
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: Back so soon? Any news?
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: A-are you feeling alright, ? You look a little uneasy.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: We need your opinion on an important matter.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: Important matter, huh...?
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: I can tell from your tone this isn't gonna be a lighthearted chat... but I'm ready to hear it.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You tell Seele about the IPC debt and the choice facing Bronya...
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: I... think I get it. At first, I thought it was just a few IPC ruffians overstepping their boundaries...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Yeah, you didn't think the future of Belobog was at stake, right?
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: Right... I need a little time to process this...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: As it stands, the votes are even. Your opinion will make all the difference.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: ...In that case... I... I abstain.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Huh?!
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Your vote is extremely important...
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: I've thought about it... This responsibility rests on Bronya's shoulders, not mine.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You have to shoulder this responsibility.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: No, this responsibility rests on Bronya's shoulders, not mine.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: No matter the choice she makes, she has far greater foresight than I do — she can see the bigger picture more clearly than I can.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: The vote is tied. If I were to give you my view, it would tip the scales and possibly impact her final choice.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: I'll respect whatever decision she makes, but... it's not my place to make it for her.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: ...Understood, Seele. This is a difficult decision to make, and everyone feels differently about it.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: It's times like these that a leader must stand up and do what's needed...
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: Right... It's Bronya's decision. She knows what's at stake — she won't run away from her duty. I trust her wholeheartedly.
[Future Market (II)][Seele]: If she asks you, just let her know my reasoning. She'll understand.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Well, it's all in Bronya's hands now. She has to make the final call.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: She plays a crucial role on this world.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Right? I'm glad Belobog has someone like her in charge...
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Do you trust her judgment?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: You bet! The Express can vouch for Bronya. That says a lot about her character.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: The time has come — let's go fill her in. I'm curious to see how she's handling those Qlipoth ministers.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Whoa, the fort's packed... I've never seen this many people here before.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Geez... I can barely even hear myself think!
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: March, , you're back.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: So... what's the verdict? What do the people think?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: We talked to people in both the Overworld and Underworld. The final result was... a tie.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I see... I suppose everyone has their own way of seeing things. I can't say I'm surprised.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ...What was Seele's perspective on the matter?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: She's behind you, whatever you decide.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: She thought it wasn't her place to say.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ...I should've known. That sounds like Seele alright.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? It's so loud I can't tell what anyone's saying...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: It's pretty much the same situation here. Neither party is willing to compromise.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The time has to come to make a decision... This chaos cannot be allowed to continue any longer.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Enough!
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: All of you!
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ...I know what to do.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Wait!
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I have something to say to the Supreme Guardian.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: But... aren't you—?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Himeko! Wait, is that the real you or a hologram!?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Haha, it's the real me, March — real as they come.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Miss Himeko? From the Astral Express? I—It's an honor — thank you for all your help in our previous... campaign. Things might have turned out differently without your support.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: If we'd known of your arrival beforehand, the Architects would have given you a proper welcome. I'm afraid the current circumstances are quite exceptional...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I understand, Miss Bronya — no need to explain. Your city is facing immense difficulties — my intention is simply to ensure that you have all the relevant intel.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Do you have a solution, Himeko?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I hesitate to call it a solution, but I have some information that might help.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: It is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Couldn't you have come a bit sooner?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: The life of a navigator is a busy one, . You should be glad that I made it in time.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: There is some important information that I must pass on to you, Supreme Guardian. It is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Information? Please, tell me what you know, Miss Himeko.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I happen to have a friend with knowledge of Topaz. What Topaz said about her homeworld is indeed true... which is why she believes that the IPC's takeover of Belobog is the only way of ensuring the city's survival...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: ...but there is one thing she intentionally left out: Not all worlds that have accepted the IPC's terms have been saved.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: You mean...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Performing "ecological reconstruction" on a planet carries inevitable risks.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: According to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the IPC's technology is 63%.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Only 63% of planets succeed? That's not exactly comforting...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: This is the overall average across all IPC projects. The success rate of projects personally handled by Topaz is above 80%. She's undoubtedly one of the most capable people in her field.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. I think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Ultimately, it's up to you, Supreme Guardian, to make the final call.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I understand... Thank you, Miss Himeko. This information is of great help.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Regardless of how alluring their promises may be, this contract is nothing more than a gamble. As leader, I cannot let the future of Belobog hinge on a roll of the dice.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Now that you've decided, I don't have to pretend to be impartial anymore. I think you're making the right choice, Bronya.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Astral friends, I have an idea. But for it to work, I'll need everyone's cooperation.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I need some time to rally all the residents in the city... and then I'll meet with Topaz again.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Please locate her for me. It doesn't matter where she is or what she's doing. And if the IPC is still trying to take over Belobog's assets, I ask that you do everything in your power to stop them.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Don't worry, leave it to us — we'll find her. It won't be easy dealing with her, but March and  will help me get the job done.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Belobog's future is not for sale, and we'll never forget the friends who stood by us in our time of need — not once, but twice.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Stay safe, everyone.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Gepard should be waiting for us in Rivet Town, right?
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: The supreme guardian has briefed me on the situation and asked that I assist you in locating Topaz.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Ready to enter Rivet Town? We'll go in together when everyone is set.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Ready.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Keep your guards up — we might run into IPC agents ahead.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Just a minute.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Take your time — preparation is key.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Meanwhile, with Topaz and Svarog...
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Destination reached.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Well, would you look at that. I never would've guessed it'd be here.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: But I don't see any mech or weapons... This place is completely surrounded by mountains — surely they can't be...
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Affirmative. The weapons are concealed within the towering rock formations.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: No wonder we couldn't find the "automaton factory." It was right under our noses all along.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Wait a minute, you said these weapons have been hidden here from the very beginning? That means the Architects of Jarilo-VI never used them in their fight against the Legion.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Correct. After the IPC departed from this world more than 700 years ago, no one has possessed the necessary knowledge for activating these weapons.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: The Architects used the IPC blueprints to construct replica automatons. However, the overwhelming majority of the combatants, commanded by Alisa Rand, were human.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I see... The stories about this world are truly captivating.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: I would like to ask you a question, Topaz.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Haha, you're awful polite for a big robot. Ask! Don't be shy!
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: "If the IPC does not intervene, this world is doomed." Are you convinced of this conclusion beyond any doubt?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Yes. I've gone through countless case studies and they all point to the same conclusion: Any world that comes into contact with a Stellaron is doomed.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: On the surface, things may appear to be getting better since the Astral Express lent a helping hand, but sooner or later the underlying problems will resurface.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: A looming crisis can often lie hidden beneath the illusion of prosperity, unnoticed by many.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Understood.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: "Understood..." That's it? You don't have any thoughts on the matter?
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Emotional readings indicate that your response is sincere and accurate. That is all I wish to confirm regarding this matter.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: While my opinion on the future of this planet may differ from yours, it ultimately holds no weight. I am merely a tool, not a decision-maker.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Ha... If only my colleagues had the same self-awareness as you.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Come on Numby, we've got some assessing to do.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Topaz disappeared after leaving Rivet Town. In her absence, her subordinates flooded in and took over.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: The IPC soldiers are well-equipped — it wouldn't be wise to fight them head-on. Captain, what do you have in mind?
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: You're right, Miss Himeko. We'll be using the Automaton Stealth Bomb to cover our tracks.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Automaton... Stealth Bomb?
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: I'll explain later. Let's get moving.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Look — down there! It's the IPC!
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Keep noise to a minimum — everyone. We don't want to alert the enemy to our presence.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: It's time to deploy the Automaton Stealth Bomb.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Are you ready, ? Use the Automaton Stealth Bomb to wipe out the IPC threats.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Ready.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Remember, try to avoid being noticed. Remaining hidden will increase our chances of success.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Oh no, they saw right through it...
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: It's alright — we prepared many backups. Try again.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Wow! We wiped them all out in a single explosion! That's what you call efficiency!
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: It's a shame we had to resort to this method, but we had no choice.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: You Silvermane Guards sure are a righteous bunch...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I've seen standard-issue robots like these before. It's an IPC field Team Leader.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Correct — the exterior is similar to the Grizzly, but its weapons and armor are more advanced.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Hopefully, the Automaton Stealth Bomb will still be effective. , let me know when you're ready.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Are you ready, ? Use the Automaton Stealth Bomb to wipe out the IPC threats.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Ready.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: Remember, try to avoid being noticed. Remaining hidden will increase our chances of success.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Oh no, they saw right through it...
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: It's alright — we prepared many backups. Try again.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Woohoo! The coast is clear!
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: To be honest, I didn't think it would be so powerful... Good thing everything went according to plan.
[Future Market (II)][Gepard]: This is the road that Topaz took when she left Rivet Town.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Let's find her and tell her about Bronya's decision.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: This time, the gloves are off!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Mr Svarog! Are you alright? I hope Topaz and her IPC henchmen didn't hurt you.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Greetings, outsiders. System functions are normal — I have had no conflict with the IPC's representatives.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I thought we might be facing off against each other for a moment.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Such a result would be highly undesirable.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: Topaz is ahead. She had the means to force me to comply with her orders, but chose not to.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: From her perspective, the only way to "preserve" Belobog is by incorporating it into the IPC. While I do not agree with her viewpoint, I lack the computational power to provide evidence to the contrary.
[Future Market (II)][Svarog]: While it is unlikely, I still encourage the avoidance of any potential conflicts.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: "Unlikely, potential..." meaning there could still be conflicts...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Don't worry, March. The Express never pursues conflict as a first means... but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. That's how it's always been.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Himeko's right. As long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Why would Topaz come here? Is she looking for something?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: It's possible. Many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Oh, hey there slowpokes! I was starting to think you weren't gonna show up.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Hmm... This lady next to Miss March looks oddly familiar.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Pleasure to meet you, Miss Topaz. I'm Himeko, the Astral Express' navigator.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Oh wow, I remember now, the illustrious Miss Himeko! Some of my colleagues dream about meeting you!
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Himeko is that famous?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Of course! The Nameless have quite the reputation — you're following in the footsteps of the great Akivili, after all!
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Do I have any fans?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I'd be surprised if you didn't! Don't underestimate the reputation of the Nameless out among the stars — you're following in the footsteps of the great Akivili, after all!
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: I'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. Topaz, based on your greeting I presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Of course! The deadline has already passed, but Bronya still hasn't signed the contract. I think I can guess what's holding her back...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Please don't misunderstand us, Miss Topaz. We have no intention of opposing the IPC or its board of directors... but we have very dear friends on Jarilo-VI.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract... goes against everything the Nameless are about.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Um... Miss Himeko, sorry for interrupting, but this doesn't sound like a negotiation...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: We needn't waste our time, March. She made her decision ten minutes ago.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Haha, there's no fooling the Astral Express!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: You're absolutely right. Differing views don't necessarily mean one person is right and the other is wrong. However, to keep things moving forward, there's usually only one solution...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Huh? Wh—What do you mean?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: My superiors have granted me the approval I need.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Approval for what?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: You're very curious about my work, aren't you?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Your vacation time has been approved?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Haha, I wish!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: So many eager faces — I won't keep you in the dark any longer.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Approval to launch an attack on the members of the Astral Express...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: The best-kept secret to getting something over the line?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Always be ready to turn the tables.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Go, Numby!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Projects under my wing... have no room for error!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Incredible! No wonder the Astral Express is so highly regarded!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Finished warming up? Now it's my turn...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Stop! All of you! Put down your weapons!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: B—Bronya? You're here just in time! Things were about to get out of control!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Supreme Guardian? I was starting to wonder whether you'd left the Express crew to fend for themselves! That would hardly be becoming of you.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I would never do such a thing. There was an important matter that required my attention.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...MORE important than this?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Yes. I think you'll understand the significance once you see it... In short, I need you to help us evaluate our current progress.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Help you? Hmm, that's interesting. I was under the impression you'd already decided to obstruct our operations here.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I have read your letter word for word, Miss Topaz, and your childhood experiences truly touched me.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Your hometown once experienced a similar catastrophe to Jarilo-VI, so I can understand your perspective on the issue and the position you have taken.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: It's because of this empathy you have, that I still hold out a glimmer of hope. Despite all that's happened, I hope we can still find common ground... through peaceful means.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...I have to admit, talking to you is always such a pleasure. I apologize for my behavior just now, it was... inappropriate.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I admire your determination. Seeing as we've come this far... I've changed my mind — I'll hold off a little longer and see what you have to show me. But remember — winning over the higher-ups won't be easy.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I understand. That's why I've been taking things one step at a time. The first step was changing your mind.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Members of the Express, we'll need your help, too.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: What a dismal sight. This district... Have you been here before?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Yes... This is where we put an end to it all...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: ...And then began again.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: That's right.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Kyle, sorry for the delay. Are we clear to proceed?
[Future Market (II)][Soldier Kyle]: The path ahead is clear, Madam Guardian. You and your companions can proceed north without hindrance.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Excellent. The mountain road ahead is a little treacherous, watch your step.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ...Let's go.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: ...What is this place? We've never been here before, right?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Mm, we've only recently discovered this domain.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Let's keep moving forward. What I want to show you is just ahead.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Look,
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The people of Belobog have not given up...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ... I just want to give them a chance.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: ...Do you two recognize that broken-down machine over there?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: The Engine of Creation...
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I thought you might.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: It's Cocolia's...
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Hey! Shh! That's a secret!
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: It's called the Engine of Creation. Do you remember it?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Miss Topaz, I know you've done a lot of research into Belobog. I was wondering if there was any information on the Engine of Creation in your records?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Not at all... which is why I find it so incredible... Such a massive feat of engineering, yet there's not a single mention of it in any of the Strategic Investment Department's reports.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I may know the reason why. The Engine of Creation was constructed solely by the people of Belobog, without any external assistance.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The project was led by the first Supreme Guardian — Alisa Rand. While warriors fought on the front lines, the engineers worked tirelessly behind the scenes, designing and constructing it...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: So what you're saying is... the "Engine of Creation" was a weapon constructed by the Belobogians themselves?
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Yes, but not entirely.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The Engine of Creation was commissioned for combat shortly after its completion and played a significant role in the battles against the Legion.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: But Alisa Rand had a long-term vision, one that nobody anticipated. For a long time, this feat of engineering was codenamed the "Geological Reconstruction Unit."
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: It was actually given a much grander purpose: to help the Belobogians rebuild their homeland and restore their world to its former glory... after driving away all those who threatened it.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Remarkable. A vision that would transcend both time and generations of Belobogians. Madam Rand was truly an inspiring leader.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Not to take away from the Supreme Guardian in front of me... Hehe, she's quite the inspiring leader as well.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Thank you, but I didn't really do anything.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: All I did was bring the people of Belobog together and make them aware that our hard-earned freedom was under immense threat once again.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: If we want to preserve this freedom, we must act and show those who doubt us that we, Belobog, have the will and the ability to control our own destiny.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: The outcome of our mobilization speaks for itself. The children of Belobog have made their decision. They have chosen to preserve this homeland with their own two hands.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...I must say, I didn't anticipate this at all.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I'll fight for this opportunity for you, Bronya. I shouldn't have conflated your own circumstances with my childhood. That was a serious lapse of judgment on my part.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: My world never had a resolute leader, so people gave up on the idea of saving themselves long ago. But your civilization has persisted through the snow and storms for 700 years... A truly admirable feat.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Then, are you willing to retract your previous decision? As for the debt... we'll find a way to gradually repay it, but it'll take some time...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Unfortunately the acquisition of Jarilo-VI is a strategic decision that's been approved by the IPC's top brass. Even if I wanted to overturn it, convincing them would be extremely difficult.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Unless...
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Don't worry, Miss Topaz. Myself and all of the Nameless aboard the Astral Express are willing to vouch for this world.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Fantastic! That might just work. As for the reports and potential accountability...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...I'll handle it.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Miss Topaz, you mentioned accountability...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Don't worry, it's nothing I can't handle. There are more important things than titles and ranks — finding the best solution is what matters most.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Will they cut your pay?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: If that's what they want to do, then so be it. I've long passed the stage of working just for money.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Won't you get fired?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Haha, that's unlikely. At most, they might lower my rank and reduce my bonus a bit. But don't worry, I work for far more than just a paycheck.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Thank you so much for all you've done, . I never thought we'd drag the Express into a crisis again, much less one that might cause a rift between you and the IPC.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: A rift? I wouldn't go that far. Also, it's me who's mostly to blame — I didn't keep my subordinates in check.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Mind putting in some good words for me with your bosses?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Oh? Thinking about a career change?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Sure thing! I'll put in the best words I can, .
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: Is it true the IPC requires you to go through 17 rounds of interviews?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: 17? Oh... I think I might know who you're talking about.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: You could say he's a special case. For most people the interview process is much shorter.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Hehe, I'm glad we're able to discuss some lighter topics.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: , you all need some rest after everything you've been through. I've arranged rooms for you all at the Goethe Hotel.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: Miss Topaz, if you need somewhere comfortable to stay...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I appreciate the offer, but I need to head back and deliver my reports.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: , Miss Bronya, it's been great getting to know you both. I hope we can work together again in the future... only next time under better circumstances!
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: , why don't you head over to the Goethe Hotel and relax for a bit? Miss Topaz and I still have a few matters to discuss.
[Future Market (II)][Bronya]: I'm sorry you didn't get to experience the festival atmosphere this time around... I promise I'll make it up to you all next time.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Phew, I was worried things were gonna get ugly again. A peaceful solution is always the best solution.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Speaking of solutions... Are they repairing that giant robot — the one we fought against? I remember you took control of it and helped us defeat Cocolia!
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I wonder if we'll have time to celebrate the Solwarm Festival.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Right! I'd totally forgotten — that's the whole reason we came here in the first place!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Looks like everyone in the city's helping with construction — doubt there'll be much time for celebrating. Still, look on the bright side — we got to meet a top IPC executive! The trip wasn't a complete waste, right?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: I hope Topaz's negotiations go smoothly.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Miss Topaz is definitely up to the job! She has that aura of... what's the word... invincibility!
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: Well, we didn't get to enjoy the festivities this time round, but at least we still got to meet a top IPC executive!
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Y'know, , I'd heard you and March speak highly of the Supreme Guardian before, but seeing her methods firsthand left me in awe.
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: We should also be glad that Miss Topaz is the one in charge of the Jarilo-VI project. If it were someone else from the Strategic Investment Department, things might have gotten... complicated.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: What do you mean, Himeko?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: The Strategic Investment Department comprises the IPC's most elite employees, many of whom can be very... forceful.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: You mean Topaz didn't make things complicated enough?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: That tells me you really don't understand the Strategic Investment Department, .
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Let's talk about this later when you're back on the Express. You and March must be tired after such an incredible journey — it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
[Future Market (II)][Mechanic]: This bridge is structurally unstable, please stay clear until repairs are complete.
[Future Market (II)][March 7th]: I've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on Belobog, Himeko?
[Future Market (II)][Himeko]: Well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: :
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: :
[Future Market (II)][???]: In light of the events that have transpired, we will be taking the following disciplinary measures against you.
[Future Market (II)][???]: Your rank will be demoted from P45 to P44, with corresponding adjustment to your basic salary. All bonuses for the current cycle will be revoked, including stock options and performance bonuses.
[Future Market (II)][???]: You will also need to submit an additional report regarding this incident to Diamond. If you have any objections to this penalty, you may also file an appeal in writing.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: I have no objections.
[Future Market (II)][???]: Understood. Is there anything else anyone would like to add?
[Future Market (II)][Narration]: ...
[Future Market (II)][???]: If there are no further remarks, this meeting is concluded.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...
[Future Market (II)][???]: You only got demoted one rank? Whew, you dodged a bullet there — pretty big project to mess up on. Someone must be looking out for you. Oh, they've already left the call...
[Future Market (II)][???]: Ugh, this voice changer is driving me crazy. Let me turn it off.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Aventurine? Why are you still on the line?
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: Hey, what's with the hostility? It's not like I'm your boss... Oh, wait, I guess I am now? Haha! My apologies — I'm still getting used to my new place in the hierarchy!
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Can I help you? If you've got something to say, say it already.
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: Oh, nothing important — just checking in on you. I told you Jarilo-VI would be a high-risk low-reward case. Why'd you even bother?
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: In our line of work, having a kind heart can be more of a liability than an asset. If you're not careful, you'll end up leading yourself down a dead-end road...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Anything else? If not, I'm hanging up.
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: W—Wait, hold on a minute, don't hang up. I get it, you're not in the mood for this conversation right now... Okay, how about this — something that might interest you...
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: While you were enjoying your playtime on Jarilo-VI, Diamond was busy taking care of the head honcho of the Building Material Logistics Department. That's why he didn't attend today's meeting.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Taravan?
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: That's right, the renowned Taravan — one of the seven board members! He's throwing his support behind us instead of the Marketing Development Department for once. Ha! Oswaldo won't be laughing anymore!
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: Diamond's been a great help to both of us. Your antics on such a crucial day can't exactly have painted the Strategic Investment Department in a good light, y'know?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: Since you get the point, let's get down to business... I'm currently at Pier Point — there's a major deal that could affect the whole department. I just so happen to need a reliable project manager for the job... what do you say, old friend?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Huh, and what prompted the mighty Aventurine to start collaborating with others?
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: Penacony, what else?
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...What?
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: That's right⁓ Now that's the kind of reaction I was hoping for.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: Hold on a minute... Diamond picked you for this project? I was expecting someone like Opal or Obsidian to handle it — at least somebody higher than rank P46...
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: Honestly, who knows? "The Family" has some pretty questionable characters. If you ask me, doing business with them is a lost cause.
[Future Market (II)][Aventurine]: But as we both know, the IPC does more than just "business deals" — guess it's my time to shine. So, how about it? This is a rare opportunity. Consider it. You never know, you might even be able to make up for your blunder on Jarilo-VI.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...I'll get back to you later.
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...Seems it's just one wild ride after another...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: ...but I hope I made the right decision this time...
[Future Market (II)][Topaz]: This snow is mesmerizing...

[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Yo, it's you! You're interested in the supernatural, right?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Lucky for you, I just finished editing my stream — it's all the proof you need...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: But before you watch it, I gotta ask you a question... do you believe in ghosts?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I believe!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I knew it! Curious cats like us usually have a better sixth sense — it's easier for us to perceive the unseen...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Vids or it didn't happen... and no clickbait.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Hehe, I think you're in for a surprise...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: This video is gonna prove that the Xianzhou is full of supernatural phenomena.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: My beliefs aside, your messages...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Uhh, that was me copying video titles from the hottest streamers on the Luofu... I heard they help attract more viewers.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Enough chit-chat — look! This is the weird stuff that happened yesterday when I was streaming in Fyxestroll Garden!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: What's up guys, Little Gui here. We've come to the scariest, most haunted place on the Luofu — Fyxestroll Garden.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Don't forget to like, follow, and share — or else I'm gonna chicken out!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: They say there's been paranormal activity, here—
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: You're such a scaredy-cat... You said you'd protect me!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: How do I stab something that doesn't have a body!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I think I just saw something move!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: D—Don't panic! I've got your back...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][???]: Ooooh, what a terrible way to die...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: A few hours later
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: A—And a group of flames suddenly grew suuuuper big!"
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: A—And then they floated right up to us, and they were like "gahhhh!"
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: A—And Sushang was like "Eeeeek!" A—And then she fell over.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Miss Sushang, can you get up? Aren't you getting cold?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Me and my bestie got kicked out of the garden straight after... but did you see the key moment?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The "ghosts" were cheap special effects?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: What!? No! There was a freezing chill, not to mention the way they drifted through the air... They were legit ghosts! Anyway, the key point was...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Why is it in third-person perspective at the end?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Ugh, it's called editing? I edited it! That way I can show what happened before and after. Anyway, the key moment was...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The comments all look like bots wrote them...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Why are you so focused on all the wrong things?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: It wasn't the Realm-Keeping Commission or the Cloud Knights that came to deal with it. It was the judges from the Ten-Lords Commission!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Judges from the Ten-Lords Commission? That's crazy!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: That's what I'm saying! At first, Sushang didn't believe that Fyxestroll Garden was haunted. But after the judges showed up...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What's... the Ten-Lords Commission?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: You've been on the Xianzhou for this long and you've never heard of the Ten-Lords Commission?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: They're the most mysterious organization on the Xianzhou! Their investigators always pop up out of nowhere, then disappear without a trace. If they show up, you know something serious is going down!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: In other words, something BIG must have happened in Fyxestroll Garden for them to show up.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: They went to Fyxestroll Garden to catch ghosts...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Exactly! Now do you believe that my content isn't clickbait?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Maybe it was just a false alarm?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Possibly... but the judges kicked me and Sushang out of there straight away. It looked like they were setting something up in the garden before we left.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: There has to be a conspiracy... Uh, I mean — ghosts!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Actually, do you have some free time? Do you wanna explore Fyxestroll Garden together, just the two of us? I guarantee you we're gonna reveal the truth this time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Let's face the ghosts together!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Hee-hee, I knew it! This is what people like us live for. Let's go!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You're going despite the risk?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: High risk, high reward, high view count. As we grow up, our curiosity for the unknown gradually fades... I'm not gonna let myself become a boring grown-up.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Why are the ghosts haunting the garden? A lingering grudge, perhaps... or maybe they're an omen of some impending disaster? Aren't you curious?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...Sure.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Don't be scared. When the time comes, just hide behind me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: No.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I get it — you're scared. I'm scared too. I'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. I'll be here waiting for you when you do!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'm a little scared. Let me think it over...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I understand — I'm scared too! I'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. I'll be here waiting for you when you do!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Yo, how's that super strong sixth sense of yours?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Wanna explore Fyxestroll Garden with me? I KNOW we're gonna get to the truth this time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Let's face the ghosts together!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Hee-hee, I knew it! This is what people like us live for. Let's go!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'm a little scared. Let me think it over...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: What? What's there to think about? I get it. I'll be waiting for you here when you're ready!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: It's so dark in here... It feels like we're being watched...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Did anyone ever tell you the scary stories about Fyxestroll Garden?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Don't think so...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Then allow me! As a streamer, I've done my fair share of research. Let me find my script...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: "Wandering Fox Spirits and Ghostly Tails..." Fyxestroll Garden was originally a garden delve constructed by a Foxian craftmaster. It was a place for their kin to rest, write poems, and feast... et cetera et cetera.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: It's said the elite pilots of the Foxians were almost wiped out in the Denizens of Abundance Wars thirty years ago. People went to the Foxsomn Tomb in Fyxestroll Garden to grieve for the departed... Because of this, Fyxestroll Garden rarely saw visitors and was bereft of joy.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Over time, Fyxestroll Garden became full of flickering ghostly flames, and weeping lamentations echoed through the air. The rumor that the garden was haunted spread like wildfire among Xianzhou Luofu residents.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Sounds like the hauntings in Fyxestroll Garden could be true after all?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I know, right? I did a lot of research before I decided to film here...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...Aaaand who wrote that for you?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Ugh, man, is it that obvious? I paid Mr. Xiyan to write it up for me. Sounded a little too professional, huh?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Could you make it quick?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Sure, I guess now's not really a good time for stories... Don't worry — I can sum it up in a single sentence.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Fyxestroll Garden used to be a garden delve, but people started coming here to mourn fallen Foxian fighters at the Foxsomn Tomb, and rumors spread that the garden was haunted.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I know it's easy to cast doubt, but the Ten-Lords Commission actually showed up this time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Speaking of which, we have to avoid running into the judges. If we get kicked out, it'll all be for nothing.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Anyway, that's the background. Let's keep moving, and watch your step...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Whoa, this place feels pure evil... Hee-hee, time to get some footage.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: I wonder if this thumbnail would be approved...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Shh, follow me. Keep quiet and tread lightly...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Wait, wait, wait — stop.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...There are Ten-Lords Commission spiritfarers on patrol. Let's go the other way — we'll head to the Foxsomn Tomb first, then cut through the Locufox Forest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Hey, hey, it looks like there's someone up ahead. Let's go around.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Wow, I didn't know you were so strong, bro! But these are Luofu officials... if we're interrogated, we need to get our story straight...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Wraith Warden]: Halt!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...Wh—What's up guys, hear me out!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Wraith Warden]: State your name and your business! Arrest them immediately!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Wraith Warden]: Suspicious individuals in a restricted area are detained first and interrogated later. No exceptions.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Restricted area? Since when were you in charge of Fyxestroll Garden?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: At ease, Wraith Warden. These two are not your enemies.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Aurumaton Spectral Envoy]: Understood, Your Honor.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: , look how pale she is! And it seems like her eyes aren't even focusing... Is she a ghost?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: As a member of the Ten-Lords Commission, you may as well consider me a member of the dead. I am a judge, alias "Hanya" — responsible for the four duties of detention, incarceration, interrogation, and punishment. Therefore, I know a thing or two about you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Guinaifen, an Outworlder, unemployed... You entered Fyxestroll Garden with Sushang, a Cloud Knight, the day before yesterday.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Huh? Unemployed? I'm a street performer and a streamer who reports on current events! A streamer! It's a legit operation!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: As for this one here...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'm . Nice to meet you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: ...A passenger on the Astral Express and a guest of the Seat of Divine Foresight. You assisted the Cloud Knights in resolving the Ambrosial Arbor calamity and are a friend of the Alliance.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: H-Hello... I'm a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission. My name is Huohuo.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: As a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, you should speak with more confidence, Huohuo.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...O—Okay.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Your Honor, it was all Guinaifen's idea!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: A—Are you really selling me out that fast? Whatever, I'll take the hit... It's true, I persuaded  to come along.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Regardless whose idea it was... This place has been designated as a restricted area. No one is allowed to enter.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You must have heard of... the Galactic Baseballer.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: You are a passenger on the Astral Express and a guest of the Seat of Divine Foresight. You assisted the Cloud Knights in resolving the Ambrosial Arbor calamity and are a friend of the Alliance.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ... the Nameless? From the train?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Tell me, Guinaifen. Why did you return here?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Uh, no reason. I haven't posted anything for ages, so I wanted to film some ghosts for my videos... hehe.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We have already told you there are no ghosts on the Xianzhou — it is a ridiculous superstition. As a resident of the Xianzhou, you should refrain from believing or spreading rumors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: But I saw them! They had ghostly flames coming out of their body, and they were cackling! And Sushang saw them too—
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Miss Guinaifen, it's hard to explain, but those things aren't ghosts. Please don't bring legends from your home world onto the Xianzhou...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: The roaming entities you saw are extremely dangerous energy parasites... We call them "heliobi."
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...I... Really? I don't believe it. "Heliobi"? What's that? Ohh, I get it — "heliobi" is just another word for "ghost" on the Xianzhou, right? That's gotta be it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Maybe we should let Mr. Tail out for a bit... M—Mr. Tail?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][???]: I heard you, I heard you! Tsk, unbelievable... What am I, her pet?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Mr. Tail...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: I'm a heliobus! We're not ghosts. Got it? Now scram!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: GHOOOOOOOOST!!!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: What a strange girl. Here to film ghosts, yet terrified when she lays eyes on one...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Deep breaths, Little Gui, deep breaths...! Ahem, c—can I have a small chat with this... "Mr. Tail?"
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: I said scram. I have no time to talk nonsense with you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What a rude ghost!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: I told you, I'm not a ghost! If I have to repeat myself again I'll be eating every one of you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Please don't be afraid, he's only kidding. Mr. Tail is a vegetarian.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Let's go. He doesn't want to talk to us.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Finally, someone with common sense.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: N—No way! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get something for my vids!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Your Honor, if I may ask, what exactly is this... fire thing? How can we prevent it from hurting people? ...And why is a judge carrying one around with her...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I believe we're done here. We have important matters to attend to. Huohuo, please see them off.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Y—Yes, ma'am.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Sister, don't be angry. Most of your time is spent in the field — you're not accustomed to dealing with others. Leave this to me. If I explain the reasoning, they will leave.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: As things stand, the situation in Fyxestroll Garden is sure to keep drawing attention. If we forcibly dismiss these two today, their curiosity will remain — who knows what might happen if they decide to come back. They might not be lucky enough to run into us next time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: As I said, sister, I will handle this.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: I assume the two of you heard about the damage done to the Artisanship Commission's Creation Furnace? The "heliobi" sealed within escaped and have been haunting this place. The Ten-Lords Commission has orders to capture them. I am strongly advising you to leave — for your own safety.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: If you have any questions, raise them now — I will do my best to satisfy your curiosity. But I hope you will keep any information you hear in strict confidence... and then leave Fyxestroll Garden — never to return.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Th—That's very reasonable, Your Honor! Thank you. I promise we'll leave after asking our questions.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: As a clerk at the Hall of Karma, my knowledge on these matters is somewhat limited, but I will try my best to satisfy your curiosity. Please proceed.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What exactly are heliobi?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: According to the Divination Commission's classification, they are energy parasites from the cosmos itself. They are "Starfire Essence" that materialize in the form of strange fire.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Metaphorically speaking, they are like moths to a flame... but that flame is the thoughts of sentient beings.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Are heliobi dangerous?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Yes. They attach themselves to sentient beings, feeding off their host's experiences and emotions.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: A heliobus will slowly take root in its host's nervous system, using their deepest desires and weaknesses to create wild delusions. They manipulate their host like a chess piece. The host has no choice but to obey the heliobus, so we refer to it as "possession."
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: By that point, the host is no longer who they once were, but a heliobus both similar to and completely different from their past self. The host's body will soon be exhausted by the heliobus — like burnt firewood.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: So, Tail is dangerous, too?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Dangerous!? You don't know the half of it! The other heliobi are nothing compared to me!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail... was subdued and sealed in my tail by Madam Hanya. He won't harm others.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Regrettably, heliobi are not flesh-and-blood, and so they are difficult to destroy. Before the restoration of the Creation Furnace, the Ten-Lords Commission plans to set up an "Evil Binding Matrix" in this abandoned garden to imprison these abominations.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I don't have any other questions.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: As you can see, the Evil Binding Matrix has not yet been completed, and not all the escaped heliobi have been recovered. This area is still very dangerous. I will ask Judge Huohuo to escort you out of the garden.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: "Not all the escaped heliobi have been recovered..." So that means the other supernatural stuff that's been happening on the Luofu might be related? Your Honor! I have loads of info sources! Maybe I can help you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Unnecessary. Those not involved should leave now. Go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Um... Excuse me... We should go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Hanya]: Fyxestroll Garden is full of abnormalities — even the Ten-Lords Commission cannot guarantee your safety. I suggest you leave immediately.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: This place is dangerous. You should leave at once.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Ghosts? Heliobi? Possession...? That was a big info dump, my brain is still loading...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...It all sounds more like an urban myth than a ghost story. "Energy parasite" sounds more cool than scary... don't you think?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Myths are born out of ignorance.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Yeah, I guess so... I still feel like my audience will see them as ghosts, to be honest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Ghosts can't exist without mystery.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...Mm, I never thought about it like that. Nice take!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: My audience likes getting to the bottom of mysteries, secrets, and conspiracies... We streamers have to cater to that, you know?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: *sigh* I've got loads more questions, but my curiosity is satisfied for now. We better leave before the judges decide to arrest us.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...I'm gonna see if I can get a video of Mr. Tail on the way back — I've already got the title: "Demonic Fire Suddenly Appears in Fyxestroll Garden! Innocent Foxian Girl Possessed!" What do you think? That'd get so many views...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ...Can you give me a hand?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What are we gonna do with you...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Wow! That's a yes, right...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Nope.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Okay, fine! No need to be so blunt about it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You'll be handed a few centuries of jail time if you irritate the judges.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Mm, true, but I'd probably only do a few decades, hehe.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Let's go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Yo, remember, I'll need your help. Let's go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Excuse me, can we go now?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Is Tail coming too?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Yes... he's trapped in my tail, so...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Bah — trapped for now... Sooner or later I'll find a way to make you break the seal...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: You think I like spending time with you?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You look nervous...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I'm just a bit scared about the heliobi reports... b—but I'll carry out my duties and escort you out of the garden. I should be able to do that, at least...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Tsk... If you can't then you better give up the day job and start peddling desserts...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Hmph, i—if it weren't for you, I would've opened a dessert stall ages ago!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Shall we go?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Yes. Please lead the way.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Let's go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I still have something to do.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Shall we go?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Yes, thank you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Let's go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I still have something to do.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Let's go this way. It's quicker...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Miss Huohuo, can we have Mr. Tail come out for a photo?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Miss Guinaifen, I'm on official duty right now...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: It's so quiet... It's getting scarier and scarier...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Please stay close to me...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: Did you hear that!? Wh—What was that sound?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: It's a ghoooost!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Wahhhh! Wh—Wh—What's happening?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: D-D-Don't be scared!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I—I'm not scared! I just can't stop my legs shaking...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Is it the same kind of thing as Mr. Tail?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail, is it another heliobus?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: It's nothing. You scaredy-cat, I didn't see a single thing.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: We're all good. Let's keep going.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Oh... I heard Miss Guinaifen yell, so I got scared...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Wait a minute... where did Miss Guinaifen go? Miss Guinaifen...!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...D—Did we lose her...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Oh no... W—We have to find Miss Guinaifen...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You should consider your own safety, first...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Is it me or is this place starting to feel weirder and weirder...? I'm scared... Can you stay close to me? I don't want to lose you, too...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: We need to find Miss Guinaifen, first... Stay close to me — please...!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I thought I'd lost you, too. I'm so scared... Please don't leave me here all on my own...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Guinaifen? Where are you? Huohuo, stay close...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Huohuo? Oh no. Where did she go...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Is this... a mirror? It looks a little creepy...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Hi
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Isn't this where I started?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Faraway Voice]: Hehe, you've noticed it, no? All roads are but puzzles in this place...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Faraway Voice]: Come, lost one! Do you desire to leave? Then come and find me!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: Hmm, you have a strange scent on you. You must be...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: I have heard the whispers of the leaves that fall in Fyxestroll Garden. The flames weep and profess to me that a powerful mortal approaches...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: They carry the scent of a great battle... with none other than Phantylia...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: You... You are the one who drove Phantylia away...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: ...What power... Your presence alone is delicious enough to make one tremble!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: Let me taste you, please! One bite! Just one bite! I can't wait to savor you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : These are no ordinary ingenia.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: Of course not. They are mere pawns dancing to my whim.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: Crush them! Smash them to pieces!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Mysterious Voice]: What a peppery fighting spirit! Such an addictive flavor!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: Let me see...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: The one who defeated Phantylia...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: I wonder...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: ...what they taste like?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: Hehe, you fought well... you were fighting for your survival, after all...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: I'll take that as my invitation to inhabit you for a while...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Who are you? What do you want?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: Oh, my delicious host, you taste so special... different from anyone else I've ever possessed. But what is this at your core? A Sun? Agh! It burns!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You can call me Cirrus. As for what I want... rest assured — I only want to leave this place... I have no desire to harm you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I said no! Get out!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: Argh, resisting are we...? Impressive willpower! How painful, how delectable!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: You're different from anyone else I've ever possessed... but what is this at your core? A Sun? Agh! It burns!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: Worry not, I have no interest in making you my home — I'll be gone before you know it. Let's get along while it lasts, shall we?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You can call me Cirrus. I only want to leave this place... I have no desire to harm you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Fine. Just stay put and don't cause trouble.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: ...Incredible, such a relaxed specimen — a soft cake of a host... It's almost as if... as if this body doesn't even belong to you? What makes you so detached, young ?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: And what is this at your core? A Sun? Agh! It burns!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Unknown Heliobus]: Never mind. I won't be staying for long, so let's get along while it lasts, shall we?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You can call me Cirrus. I only want to leave this place... I have no desire to harm you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Allow me to explain what's happening... The Xianzhou natives call it a "ghost lock." You're walking in a circle, and no amount of walking will get you out of it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: So, I'm going to help you break free of the circle that Furynox created, and you're going to help me evade the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. It's a win-win... How does that sound?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What did you just say? Who's "Furynox?"
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You must have figured out that I'm not the master of this place... It was created by another heliobus named Furynox.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Unfortunately, I'm the only one who can help you escape from here.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I've already found clues that can get me out of here...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You mean the talismans left behind by "little lost fox judge"? Those won't help you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Now that I'm possessing you, I can make you see things that you couldn't see before.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Fine. This is just a strategic partnership.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I refuse to work with you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: What a stubborn fool — you won't ever get out of here without my help. Anyway, I'm not here to ask your opinion.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: As a courtesy, I shall leave you intact, for the time being... As soon as I get what I want, I'll be gone.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Now, go and look at those talismans again — the paper dolls. You'll know where to go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hehe, go — find all those clues your judge friend left behind. Find the talismans...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You can trust me. I want to leave this place, too. We are useful to each other.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: In any case, It [sic] doesn't matter if you don't trust me. It's not like you can be rid of me, hahaha.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hey, use your eyes... I made the talismans float. Pay attention!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: There are so many paper dolls over there. Surely your judge friend left some clues for you. Won't you take a look?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hey, hey! I'm trying to help you. Go and look at the clues.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...Do I have to make you drag yourself over there?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Nighttales of Fyxestroll Garden]: Scene One
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...It is said that, in his mansion that day, General Teng Xiao was in deep thought, devising strategies and conducting simulations to break the encirclement of the borisins' forces. Suddenly, a strange wind blew through the hall, causing the curtains to flutter.General Teng Xiao stood up with his hands behind his back and spoke to the empty room. "It is impolite to be an uninvited guest, and even more so to hide in the shadows. Show yourself quickly!"Laughter echoed through the empty hall and suddenly, a formless green flame appeared, resembling a ghostly eye, fixating its eerie gaze on the general."I've heard that each of the Reignbow's Arbiter-Generals possess exceptional abilities, and seeing you today confirm those rumors.""I entered these halls without prior notice, and for that, I apologize. However, my purpose here is to assist you in breaking the encirclement.""The borisins' forces are closing in with the intention of completely annihilating the Luofu. Your troops are few, and resisting the enemy is as difficult as reaching the heavens."Although the green flame had no mouth, it seemed to converse like a person. It hovered through the air, illuminating the dark corners of the hall. The guards in the hall stood expressionlessly, as if trapped in a dream."Facing life and death in battle, mortals tremble in fear. But if you allow us, the heliobi, to possess you, you'll have no fear of the blade or the enemy. Defeating them will be as easy as turning your hand.""Your help freely offered must come with an exchange. I've heard that the Reignbow once exchanged their mortal body for aid from the Flint Emperor. I assume you have similar intentions?""I, Ignamar, seek nothing more than your body and emotions, General of the Reignbow." The jade flame burned brighter, growing to a size hundredfold bigger than before. "I have been dormant for a millennium, and there's no better corporeal offering for us than this!"The general remained unfazed, signaling Ignamar to continue."At midnight tonight, I shall await your answer in Fyxestroll Garden. At the garden entrance, there will be several porcelain vases, some cerulean and some vermillion. If you refuse my offer, leave the cerulean vases pristine and unharmed. At the same time, with the vermilion vases, you should break them all if you accept my offer and wish for bloody battle.""That is how I will be able to decipher your reply, general. After tonight, if you wish to meet me again, knock with the left door knocker three times, followed by the right knocker three times. No more, no less."The general frowned and sighed, "A mere malevolent spirit dares to steal one's soul and mimic human behavior. Away, and I will respond in time."...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Do you understand? This story of the supernatural is in the illusory maze for a reason. It contains the clue to help us get out of here. Come back and read it again if you need to.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The gloomy doors are silent. You follow the instruction in the book and knock on the doors, three times on the left, three times on the right.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Voice From Behind the Door]: The door will not open without the proper courtesies. Return from where you came, visitors...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Everything returns to normal.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The gloomy doors are silent. You follow the instruction in the book and knock on the doors, three times on the left, three times on the right.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Voice From Behind the Door]: The courtesies have been performed. Enter, oh honored guest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The door cracks open a sliver. Through the crack, you notice that there is no one behind the door, as if the voice from before have [sic] never existed.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: It seems like we're ready. Now, we just have to get out.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hehe, see? I told you I'd help you. The way out is straight ahead. Just keep going...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Stop. Do you remember our deal? You need to help me evade capture.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: There's a judge up ahead. What, are you scared?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Ha! THAT judge? I can taste her fear from miles away! That coward has no right calling herself a judge.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: But... that thing attached to her is the tricky part. That's something I don't wish to face.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'm getting her out of here, too.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Ugh... Is this what humans call "sympathy"? How acerbic. Yuck...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I keep my promises.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Mm, I can taste your integrity — such a rich flavor. A little hard to digest...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I did NOT make a deal with you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Aren't you a stubborn one? But that's okay. You'll come around once you've walked a few more circles in this place.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Forget about the judge — just get us both out of here.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Wait! Please don't leave me!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Please, I'm begging you! Can you please come closer? I'm so scared...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: , it's you! I—I finally found another living soul!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I'm so happy! I thought I was gonna be stuck here forever... I'm so happy to see you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Um, have you seen Miss Guinaifen? I still haven't found her. Is she gonna be okay...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Let's go find her.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: She's probably trapped somewhere around here.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Forget about her — I got possessed by a heliobus!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Give it up. Guinaifen was probably eaten by the heliobi already.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: H—H—How can that be!? If that could happen to someone as lively as Miss Guinaifen... that means I'm in even more danger...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: 
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: 
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: , you can find the way out, right? Please take me with you...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Ugh, not this again! You're a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission — why are you always begging others for help?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: You know I'm not cut out to be a judge. I thought maybe if I worked long enough in the Ten-Lords Commission, I'd get braver. But now... I know it's impossible.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Tsk, useless brat. Why was I sealed in with someone like you?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: You talk tough all day long, then let both of us get stuck in a trap... Who's the useless brat now!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Calm down! I'll get you out of here!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I can't find the way out either. It's all up to you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: HELP! I got possessed by a heliobus!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : There's no point in following me. I'm leaving, and you're not coming with me. Goodbye!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Ah! No! P—Please don't leave. Wait, please...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I didn't say that!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: 
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Cirrus, you beast...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: 
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: 
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : The Ten-Lords Commission needs to overhaul their hiring criteria. How did someone as useless as you ever become a judge?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: *sob*
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Hey, cut it out. I'm the only one around here who gets to tell this kid off... Me and those other judges. Got that!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: ...Wait. Hold on. I smell something familiar...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Cirrus... it's you. Still a fan of your pathetic ventriloquist act, I see.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Haha... Hahahaha! Oh, this is funny! This is just too funny! I thought you'd already escaped the Furnace's destiny of torture!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Who would have thought that a piece of Ignamar the Great — the fragment with the most fight in it — would become a guard dog sealed inside a crybaby...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Oh! Forgive me! Did I say guard dog? No, no, no, that won't do... You're just a guard dog's "tail," right? Just a tail, a tail, a tail!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Laugh while you can, coward! I'm gonna swallow you whole the second you leave that  body!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : H—H t—t—terrifying, ahahaha...! The joke's on you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : You couldn't leave that judge's body if you tried! You can't eat her, let alone escape from her. Ahahaha, "Mr. Tail." You're pathetic~
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: ...Darn it! Think of something, you wimp!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: , take this talisman and stick it to your body — it'll temporarily suppress the heliobus's influence...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: *sob*
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Hey! ! Say something nice to Huohuo. Her crying is like a mosquito in my ear.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Ahhhh, what a feast! Human emotions are simply delicious. Your sorrowful tears are like bottles of potent wine~
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Don't you ever talk through me like that again.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hehe, I'm simply enjoying my freedom. Didn't you use the talisman already? I'm tame as a kitten...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Does it amuse you to make a little girl cry?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Does the Xianzhou sail through the cosmos?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: For a heliobus that enjoys provoking your weak human sentiments, I can assure you there is nothing more amusing.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Now, don't forget about our deal. I will leave only once I've got what I wanted.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Say, are you still possessing me?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Of course. Surely you don't think I've left you just because you can see me? So naive!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I know what you want to ask. Yes, it does amuse me to make a little girl cry, and no, I haven't left your body. There, now you can save your breath.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Cirrus talks nothing but nonsense... but even so, Huohuo has a sensitive heart. You. Go say something nice to the girl.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Aren't you looking down on her all the time?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Yes, which is why she needs other organic beings like you to support her! Get it? Go!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Why don't you go say something nice to her?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Keep dreaming. I have nothing nice to say to anyone.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You can roam free even though you're sealed?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Roam free!? Is that what you call this? This is as far as I can get from her.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You think I'd be here playing house with you numbskulls if I could fly away?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: What are you staring at? Go. Say something nice to the girl.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: *sob*
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'm sorry, Huohuo... Are you okay?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: It's not your fault... It was that bad heliobus making us fight...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Stay strong, Huohuo — you're a judge.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ..If I were any other judge, you'd already be saved...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Someone as nice as you wouldn't say such mean things — only a possession would make you act like that. Still, what the heliobus said was true...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I've always been shy and scared... My life's been a nightmare ever since Tail possessed me...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: When I was at school, people were always asking me why my tail was on fire... Everywhere I went, people would notice.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Oh, so it's all my fault? If you'd just let me devour you at the start, I could've spared you the trouble!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Th—Then I got into the Ten-Lords Commission. Everyone there is weird, so I thought I'd found somewhere I belonged. But the job... the job is too dangerous! I have to fight demons and ghosts and bad guys every day...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I... I'm just not cut out for it. If I make it back alive... I'm handing in my resignation.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Who thought making a heliophobe with a heliobus in her tail hunt heliobi was a good idea... I'm sorry, I've been so useless...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You're doing very well already, Huohuo.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...R—Really?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You're the one who left the paper dolls for me. Thank you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...I—I'm glad it helped...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You hear that? Stop crying. You're useful. And your paper dolls are useful too.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Ugh, I've had enough of this! As soon as I swallow that coward Cirrus, I'm going to devour this little crybaby too!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: What a pity that "Mr. Tail" is nothing like he used to be. If we still had our old power, we could forget about this maze and devour its creator, Furynox.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Your old power?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Well, "Mr. Tail," seems she knows nothing about your past... Little missy, do you know why the heliobi are gathered in this abandoned garden instead of seizing human habitations?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Team-building?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie 1.mp4
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Because over a thousand years ago, this very garden was the site of an epic battle between the general of Luofu and the great heliobus Ignamar.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Now that the furnace is broken and the heliobi have escaped, fragments like us, who once constituted Ignamar the whole, have returned here — with the desire to challenge the general again.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: The battle between the general and Ignamar was an earth-shaking contest of devastating proportions! Ignamar underwent countless transformations, causing floods, fire, and thunderous landslides... They were locked in a standoff — an evenly matched fight!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Evenly matched... Really?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Evenly matched... Really?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Of course!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I didn't know Jing Yuan had such a history.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: The general who fought for the Luofu against the heliobus was named "Teng Xiao."
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...The Ten-Lords Commission records say that Ignamar was soundly defeated by General Teng Xiao...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Of course the human records would flatter their general!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: The great Ignamar absorbed the power of countless fellow heliobi, but ultimately underestimated human deceit... They were narrowly defeated by the general.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: We heliobi could never condense into physical form after that battle. We scattered into fragments and were sealed into the Creation Furnace...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...but there's an exception to everything. "Mr. Tail," I thought you'd escaped to freedom... Who could've guessed you'd be sealed in this tiny Foxian girl? Humiliating...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Sealed my foot! My power was weak when I ran into this fox child. It was bad luck, nothing more!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie 2.mp4
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: When I was littler, I saw a ball of fire that looked like it was about to turn to embers...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I felt sorry for it, so I picked it up and put it on my tail... and then... Mr. Tail tried to eat me! If the judges hadn't arrived, it would've been over...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Bah, I did no such thing — you're barely big enough to be an appetizer.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: All the pain I've suffered since I met you must be retributions for my stupidity back then...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hilarious! it's a pity "Mr. Tail" didn't devour you... He might've recovered his power and turned the Xianzhou upside down... just like Ignamar did!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Why did the heliobi challenge the general?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Why? Does there have to be a reason?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: The official answer is that the Xianzhou is sealing heliobi in a cage and forcing them to supply energy to the ship... In reality, however, we just want to fight the general... and see what the Xianzhou is truly made of!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Do you have a grudge against the Xianzhou?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Grudge? How shallow. If you must know the forced behind our actions...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...there's a pinch of envy — envy towards the potent emotions you corporeal beings have. Then there's a dash of aggression — the desire to see whether the heliobi or bodies of flesh and blood are stronger. Lastly, there's a drizzle of desire. We desire to possess your physical bodies, so we can eat, love, and hate.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: We heliobi were carefree lifeforms, but were tainted with the illness of humanity once we came into contact with it. It's humanity's fault for having such intense emotions and desires — now, we can never, never return to the purity of our past.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I want to be free again! I want to return to the cosmos! Mr. Tail, you don't want to regroup with the fragments, and you don't want to be her tail forever — why don't you return with me to the great beyond?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: ...Don't get ahead of yourself, Cirrus.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: That's impossible. Mr. Tail was sealed by the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. He can't escape... and neither can you...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Wahhhh! That door just opened on its own!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Less screaming, more thinking — this is an opportunity, is it not? Let's go in and check it out.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The gloomy doors are silent. You follow the instruction in the book and knock on the doors, three times on the left, three times on the right.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Voice From Behind the Door]: The door will not open without the proper courtesies. Return from where you came, visitors...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Everything returns to normal.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Nighttales of Fyxestroll Garden]: Scene One
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...Speaking of Fyxestroll Garden, there's a place within its boundaries known as Locufox Forest, which was built by Foxian craftsmen for the enjoyment of the garden's visitors. Over the years, they expanded it with elegant buildings, marking it with exceptional opulence.General Teng Xiao entered this area, but instead of seeing its beauty, he found it in ruins and desolation, filled with eerie and sinister atmospheres. He wondered how a place like this could fall into such disrepair when Fyxestroll Garden had only been completed decades prior. He suspected this was the work of heliobi's illusions.He arrived at a courtyard and was greeted by a young servant who bowed and offered him a food box. When he examined it closely, he noticed that the young servant had milky eyes, indicating impairment of sight."The food is simple, as a mere token of goodwill. You've come a long way, hungry and tired, so my master wishes for you to dine before we discuss matters further.""I've passed through at least ten moon gates to get here, but in all my visits to Fyxestroll Garden, I don't remember encountering so many gates. If your master wishes to negotiate, they should do so openly and with respect. Where does it find the audacity to play tricks on me?"The young servant remained unperturbed by Teng Xiao's stern words, as if deaf to his thunderous reprimand."With the tricks your master has played with dark arts, if I were to eat from this box, I'd probably find a lump of black mud in my mouth." With a flick of his sleeves, General Teng Xiao tossed the food box onto the ground. Sure enough, it grew spider-like limbs and skittered away."General, with your divine insight and clear vision, you've already passed the test. As a token of acknowledgment, my master wishes to present you with a gift," answered the blind servant calmly."In the side room, there are various chests to choose from. Please select the least expensive one.""As for the porcelain vases at the entrance..." The blind young servant's face twisted into a disturbing smile, no longer resembling that of an innocent child. "My master said:'General, after enduring so much on the battlefield, I'm sure you'd show compassion for the wounded and fallen soldiers. Please break all the cerulean vases. As for the vermilion ones, they must remain intact.'""It seems that we are guaranteed to strike this deal." The general let out a long sigh. He looked up and found that the clear moon had disappeared, replaced by thick, enveloping clouds."Let's hope your master doesn't come to regret its decision." Teng Xiao strode forward, pushing open the final gate....
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I feel much safer with you here... Still feel like I'm gonna faint, though...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: May the Arbiter protect us!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The gloomy doors are silent. You follow the instruction in the book and knock on the doors, three times on the left, three times on the right.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Voice From Behind the Door]: The courtesies have been performed. Enter, oh honored guest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The door cracks open a sliver. Through the crack, you notice that there is no one behind the door, as if the voice from before have never existed.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Look! Th—There's a mirror behind the door...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Voice From the Mirror]: That... sound... Huohuo... this way.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: What's going on...? Th—There's a voice in the mirror?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: That voice sounds familiar...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Voice From the Mirror]: Huohuo, are you in the mirror? I finally found you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Madam Xueyi!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Fyxestroll Garden has been enveloped by an unknown power... You must be careful!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: We still haven't found Miss Guinaifen... I don't know where she went...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The task at hand is to save you from this illusion. Come. Pass through the mirror and come to our side.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Are we... back in Fyxestroll Garden?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hmm, so many bronze mirrors. Could it be that...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Not all the mirrors are real.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: This illusion is shifting.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You're right, . This place is changing. It's trying to stop us from escaping.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But one of these mirrors must contain the exit, right? Let's check them all...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Huohuo, sweetie! Come to big sister Xueyi.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Yuck — that judge would never say something so sickly.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Let's go look at the next mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: This is the exit, you useless brat! Come here!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Ah! M—Madam Xueyi can be a bit of a meanie, but she'd never talk to me like that... That doesn't sound like her... Come to think of it, it kinda sounds like Tail.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Constructive criticism!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Hmph... Let's go look at the other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...This isn't the right place. We picked the wrong bronze mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The situation in Fyxestroll Garden is getting worse. Why have you not left? Is something the matter in there?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Over here, that sounds like the real Madam Xueyi.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The real Madam Xueyi? Are there pretenders inside the illusion?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: There are multiple bronze mirrors here.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The heliobus is trying to trick us.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I see. Do not be afraid. Huohuo knows me well — she will be able to discern me from the counterfeits.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: B—But what if I can't tell the difference?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: You must trust yourself. Come.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hurry, Huohuo. Pass through the mirror and come to me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Wait. I want to ask a few questions... to see if you're the real person.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What's the relationship between Xueyi and Hanya?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We are both Judges of the Ten-Lords Commission. Evidently, we are colleagues.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: The heliobus that trapped us here wouldn't know that Madam Xueyi and Madam Hanya are twin sisters...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: How did Huohuo manage to become a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: A powerful heliobus possessed her tail... It is a power that I dream of having for myself.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Never knew you were so popular, Mr. Tail...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Tsk, very funny...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: So, we're gonna...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hurry, Huohuo. Pass through the mirror and come to me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Wait. I want to ask a few questions... to see if you're the real person.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What's the relationship between Xueyi and Hanya?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Who is Hanya...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Uh, never mind. Forget I said anything.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: How did Huohuo manage to become a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Likely through some secret means that I am unaware of.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I didn't have any connections at all!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: So, we're gonna...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...This isn't the right place. We picked the wrong bronze mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hurry, Huohuo. Pass through the mirror and come to me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Wait. I want to ask a few questions... to see if you're the real person.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What is the relationship between Judge Xueyi and Judge Hanya?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hanya is my younger sister, but this alone cannot prove who I am. Ask me something else.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: How did Huohuo manage to become a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: "By decree of the Ten-Lords: Spiritfarer Huohuo is skilled and diligent, capable and worthy of officialdom. She is hereby promoted to the position of judge."
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I still remember the decree for her promotion.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: That's her! This has to be Madam Xueyi behind the mirror...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: So, we're gonna...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Mirrors again... what a surprise.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Look around us, Mr. Tail. I think we're at the edge of the illusion...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Maybe these are the only mirrors left?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Come here, Huohuo. Come through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I need to ask you some questions about myself first...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's personality?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: ...As a judge responsible for capturing criminals, her cowardice is a dereliction of duty. I will reprimand her severely once you leave the illusion.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Huh? That doesn't sound like Madam Xueyi... right?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Stupid girl. This is obviously a fake!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's tail?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Her tail will be extracted and suppressed after the job is over.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Hehe, you fraud... I'll deal with you once I get out!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: So, we're gonna...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Come here, Huohuo. Come through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I need to ask you some questions about myself first...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's personality?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Her caution is a skill all judges of the Ten-Lords Commission should possess.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Ha, That's a funny way of describing cowardice. Nauseating.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's tail?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: It's the most powerful fragment of Ignamar's demise. Who would have guessed it still contained so much power after so many years...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Ha, you've given the game away.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: So, we're gonna...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hurry, Huohuo. This should be the last mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I need to ask you some questions about myself first...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's personality?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: She will be expelled after tonight's operation. She is not fit for her job at the Ten-Lords Commission.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Really? So I don't even need to write a resignation letter...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Stupid girl. This is obviously a trick!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's tail?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: An insignificant demon... I can't wait to devour him myself.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Aha! Not even trying to hide your true colors!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: That's all I have to ask.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: So, we're gonna...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Pass through the mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Investigate other mirrors.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...We already passed through this mirror. The Madam Xueyi behind this mirror is most likely a fake. Let's not go there again.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I'm not the best judge of things... but these mirrors...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Not a single one is the real thing!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: None of them show Madam Xueyi as I know her to be...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: That puppet judge never respected me, but she also never let her guard down.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I've spent a long time working with Madam Xueyi. She's always known that I'm scared and timid, but she never told me off...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Tsk, the Ten-Lords Commission never cared a wink about your frail constitution. You're the only one who makes a big deal about it...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: ...and as long as you don't drag me down, I don't really care how much of a coward you are, either...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Hey, hey, hey — get away from me...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Your judgment was pretty accurate.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: See? People say good things about you. What are you gonna do about it?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You two actually get along pretty well...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: What do you know!? Tsk... And what are we even talking about? We need to focus...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: The illusion wants to keep us in, but it can't possibly keep expanding its borders forever. I think there's gotta be a fourth mirror somewhere.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I think there's a mirror on that floating island... but it's a bit far away...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: C-C-Could I crawl my way there...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Quit stalling and get on with it!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Ha, I didn't think you'd be able to, hehe. All these years and you finally started to grow up a bit.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hurry, Huohuo. This should be the last mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...I don't wanna go back the way we came, but I need to ask some questions about myself to make sure!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's personality?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Everyone is different. A judge is not a soldier, and they need more than just courage.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: It is the decree of the Ten Lords for Huohuo to be elevated to a judge. There must be some meaning in it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: ...Just what do those old fogeys see in this coward?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What do you think about Huohuo's tail?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: It is merely a sealed heliobus, a tool carrying out the will of the Ten Lords.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Hmph. I may not like it, but that is how she sees me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Let's go. This is the right mirror.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Are we... back in Fyxestroll Garden?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: You have returned safely. It seems the Ten-Lords Commission is not down on our luck today.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Madam Xueyi, I'm so happy to see you're alright!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Did you encounter anything strange on your way here?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The game's up, Cirrus.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Cirrus, get out of my body. Now.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I got possessed! Help me!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hehehe, no wonder she's a judge. Very perceptive...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Huohuo informs Xueyi of what you have experienced so far...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I understand. This isn't the time to deal with Cirrus. Fyxestroll Garden has been dragged into a powerful illusion by an even mightier heliobus, and the spiritfarers who went to suppress it have lost contact with me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Huohuo, if both Hanya and I are unable to suppress that demon, then you will have to defeat it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Huh? I-I won't be able to do it! I'm not as powerful as you two... I always run and hide before a battle...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Do not underestimate yourself. A heliobus cannot possess a body that is already possessed by another heliobus — such is your absolute advantage as a judge.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'm possessed too — do I also get an advantage?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Correct. However, Huohuo has had many more years of training and is more experienced in fighting heliobi than you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: That is why the Ten-Lords Commission is not down on our luck today. We're lucky that you have all returned at this opportune time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You hear that, scaredy-cat? You're the ace of the Ten-Lords Commission.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Indeed. Even the weakest person has their strengths.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I know you're trying to comfort me... but that sounded a little weird.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You need to start filtering out the stuff you don't wanna hear. That's what I do.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The heliobi are aggressive beings, but they cannot shake their desire for a flesh and blood body. And yet, during the 38 years you have worked for the Ten Lords, you have been constantly able to suppress the monster within your tail and maintain your personality. You are already a fitting judge. Be confident.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: On that point, none of the other judges can surpass you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Suppress the monster... B—But I don't think I've ever had to suppress Tail! I guess we're more like... friends?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Friends!? Bah! I don't make friends with food.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hehe, "Mr. Tail," puny fragments like us were deprived of Ignamar's power long ago... If a little girl can subdue us, then perhaps it's time for some humility.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Shut your trap!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Though Furynox is powerful, we have a chance of suppressing them if we can break them into multiple fragments.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You have a sound plan, Your Honor... and since the stage is set, allow me to offer my assistance. Let's find somewhere more open first... like Swallowsong Pavilion, over there.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Let's listen to Cirrus's plan.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Let's go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Wait, let me think about it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I understand. Take your time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Cirrus already helped us in the illusion maze. Maybe... we can trust them for now?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Cirrus may have ulterior motives.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You can believe whatever you like. I just want to get out of here. That's all I want.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Both you and Madam Xueyi are here. They can't escape.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Yes, yes, you're right. I can't escape. Do you trust me now?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I guess we can go with Cirrus's plan. It's not like we have any of our own...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Have you made up your mind?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Let's listen to Cirrus's plan.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Let's go.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Wait, let me think about it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I understand. Take your time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You've heard the story of Ignamar and the great heliobus's glorious fight against the general. They were an entity born of many heliobi fusing together...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...but heliobi are gradually tainted by the emotions and desires of those we possess. We tend to spite each other and don't like to fuse together — it's like having multiple personalities inside a single head. It leads to "infighting..."
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: A powerful heliobus like Ignamar or Furynox might be able to swallow a lesser heliobus and placate them for a while...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...but this internal balance is easily broken when exposed to external forces — just like how we were torn apart and reborn after Ignamar fought the general.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Therefore... this might be the way to defeat Furynox. We can cause them to break apart and reduce their power, then the Ten-Lords Commission can use their sacred vessels to seal up all of Furynox's fragments.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I have a question. Why are you betraying your own kin? Why would you help the Xianzhou when we have sealed you for so long?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Why? Must heliobi always have a reason for their behavior? Perhaps I don't want Furynox to devour me. Perhaps I dislike idiots who use force and nothing else. Perhaps I wish to fight the general myself...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...or maybe I just want to do a favor for the Ten-Lords Commission that will ensure I can leave here in one piece?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: We should allow Cirrus to go ahead with their plan.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Don't believe Cirrus!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Judges of the Ten-Lords Commission always keep our promises. If you can truly deal with the problem at hand, I will ask for your freedom from the Ten Lords. However, I cannot guarantee the outcome of the appeal.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: How conventional. Fine, I accept... but you better keep your promise, puppet.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Hehe, me and Furynox were "furnacemates..." I know them well. They are powerful, but as naive as a child and obsessed with victory. I only need to say three things to incite them.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: , I'll need your body for a while longer.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Furynox! Furynox...!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: *There is a vague sound from far away. A response, possibly.*
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Before you duel the general, why don't you fight me?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Distant Voice]: ...Cirrus? What makes you worth my time, weakling?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Distant Voice]: I've turned this garden into my territory and made the dogs of the Ten Lords my puppets! As soon as the general arrives, the heliobi will have our rematch. Why should I fight my own at this crucial moment?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : That group of amateurs you've put together? Hah. They're nothing compared to me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : I have already obtained the most wonderful pawn for myself — a piece that once expelled Phantylia!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Distant Voice]: ...Phantylia? Phantylia! I remember! What a wonderful host... I want it!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: : Then send the spiritfarers under your control to find me. If you can defeat this Nameless I'm possessing, then you can swallow me up and let my strength aid you in your fight against the general. What do you say?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Distant Voice]: Deal! My pawns and I will show you no mercy!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: See? Easy-peasy.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Tsk, does that mean all the spiritfarers out there have fallen? What a useless army.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Does that mean we'll be fighting our friends...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Oh, do puppets feel empathy? Or do you not wish to defeat Furynox anymore? We heliobi think of such matters as business transactions. As long as something can bring us victory, we will destroy everything — even allies and kin.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Make the decision. Furynox's pawns — your companions — must be destroyed.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: ...Please come over here. I need to give you something.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: You two, take this before we fight Furynox.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: This is the Lunaumbra Gourd, a sacred vessel made by the Artisanship Commission. The Ten-Lords Commission has made some changes to it to better suppress heliobi. After you fight the puppets controlled by Furynox, make sure you seal their heliobi fragments in here.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Also...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'll look after Huohuo.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Her time as a judge has been brief — she is still inexperienced. Apart from that, please also have mercy on the spiritfarers that have fallen under Furynox's control.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I'll go easy on the spiritfarers.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The Ten Lords will not forget your acts of kindness. Thank you.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Mr. Tail, we're gonna fight some really dangerous enemies now. Please lend me your strength, too.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Oh-ho? Sounds like someone finally learned to talk tough.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: I would've believed you if your legs weren't shaking so much!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Don't point that out! It took me a lot of effort to be this brave! All this time I've just been hiding behind  . I'm such a bad judge...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Madam Xueyi said those possessed by a heliobus can't get possessed again... I'm the only person who can help everyone!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Exactly! You're welcome, by the way... So, what are we waiting for? Let's go!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Huohuo, though I am of ingenium body, I too am feeling a sliver of fear.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Madam Xueyi... you're afraid too?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Faced with a demon that can manipulate life at will, of course I'm afraid... Afraid that I won't ever work with my sister again.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Huohuo, I'm afraid too.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...I—I guess if even you two are afraid, then... I—I feel a little better now.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Afraid or not, we're still gonna beat the heck out of it!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Let's go! I will find my own way to defeat the pawns possessed by Furynox... and before that foolish heliobus has realized what's happening, I will suppress all of their fragments within the Lunaumbra Gourd.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...So we'll need to activate the Evil Binding Matrix, right?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Once my task is done, I will meet you at the Verdant Terrace and activate the Evil Binding Matrix at its matrix core.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Okay.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: If Furynox is so powerful, why would they allow themself to break apart so easily?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: The stronger you are, the more you underestimate your enemies... sometimes being weak and humble is the way to survive.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Those are... possessed Wraith Wardens...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Don't expect me to hold back.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Help me, Mr. Tail!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: What happened to talking tough!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Furynox's Fragments: Aaaah—
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Fragments of Furynox have been sealed in the gourd.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Thank the Arbiter!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Take your paper dolls out, quickly! Do you remember the incantation?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: P—P—Paper to might, carry this fight! Talisman of strength, evils to spite!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Furynox's Fragments: Let us go. Let us go!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...There are plenty of heliobi in the gourd now. Let's go and meet up with Madam Xueyi.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: It's Madam Xueyi... and Miss Guinaifen! Thank goodness she's alright...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: There are so many spiritfarers lying on the floor!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: ! Huohuo! I'm so glad you're okay!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: I have defeated all the spiritfarers controlled by Furynox... It was quite troublesome taking them down without doing any harm.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: How goes your task?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: We're doing well. We've sealed most of Furynox's fragments.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Now, we shall seal the fragments absorbed by the Lunaumbra Gourd into the Evil Binding Matrix. Once Furynox's power has been stripped, it will no longer be able to influence reality in Fyxestroll Garden.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: This gourd is so pretty! Is this what they call a "sacred vessel" on the Xianzhou?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Miss Guinaifen, please be careful... You might feel dizzy if you get too close to the matrix...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Guinaifen]: It's okay. It's okay. This is my first time seeing the Ten-Lords Commission's exorcising tools up close~
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Huohuo, get her away from her!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Her face emotionless, Guinaifen smashes the gourd on the ground and countless heliobi break free.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: She faints right after.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Oh no!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Escaped  Heliobi]: Cirrus~ It's Cirrus~ You won~ You won...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Escaped  Heliobi]: Don't leave us... help us... take us... to restore Ignamar's glory together!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Muahahahaha⁓
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Thank you, Your Honors, for helping me clear so many obstacles and collect so many heliobus fragments.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I told you I'd leave your body,  .
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Excellent. I will keep my promise.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Escaped  Heliobi]: Absoooorb ussss⁓! Absoooorb ussss⁓!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Oh no! They're stealing the power of other heliobi.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: With this strength...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...I will be...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...undefeatable!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Pawns, let's go again, shall we?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: You monster!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: This demon... is quite troublesome...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Is everyone okay!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: They've consumed too many heliobi...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We'd die from exhaustion before we manage to weaken it.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: We've still got a chance, puppet...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Cirrus said it themselves. There's a fragile balance when heliobi fuse together.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: You know what to do, don't you, Huohuo?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: But...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: But what? Aren't you gonna be living the life you've always wanted once I'm gone?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Ugh, these pawns are no fun. Why don't you join in too, hmm?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Why struggle? Be my subject!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: If you can't win... you just cheat!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Grrrr, useless!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Get yourself together!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: *sob* They just won't die!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: We can't beat them...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Not so fast... you've got me, haven't you!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: See you on the other side, Huohuo!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: You wretch! What are you doing!? Get out... get out!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: G—Get out!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Hey Cirrus, why don't you try swallowing ME too, huh?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Are you insane? Why are you helping humans!?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: Why? You need a reason? How about this one...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Tail]: I'd rather help a human than a conniving simpleton like you!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Uwhaaaa—!!!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I—I won't let Mr. Tail sacrifice himself in vain!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: T—Talismans. On my command!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Talismans! Talismans!! Talismans!!!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: The unanticipated turmoil of the Heliobi Disaster turned in a rain of fire. Cirrus grasped the chance to possess a spiritfarer, only for the Ten-Lords Commission to subdue it. Tail, however, is nowhere to be seen...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: :
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The one possessing Huohuo... seems to have disappeared. I don't know if I should be happy or sad for her...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Never mind. I've never been good at figuring out emotions.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Thank you for your assistance, Nameless. Reinforcements from the Ten-Lords Commission will be here soon, and Guinaifen will be sent to an apothecary.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Your body seems to be severely malfunctioning.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: It is only an artificial ingenium body. I can swap into another one easily. Do not worry.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I don't see Judge Hanya anywhere...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hanya returned to the Ten-Lords Commission after you left. She is coming with the reinforcements as we speak.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Is Cirrus dead?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: No. The demon lives on. They even possessed a young spiritfarer under my command. "As Starfire Essences, the heliobi will never die" — the records in the Ten-Lords Commission's evil-binding tomes were all real...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Cirrus lost most of their power and poses no danger for the time being. But they will remain a threat for as long as they exist...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Thankfully, the Ten-Lords Commission had prepared other sacred vessels to suppress the heliobi. We will construct a matrix all over this abandoned garden and seal the heliobi within. The Xianzhou will live to see another day.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We can leave the rest to the Ten-Lords Commission from here... Even I feel like I need a rest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We can leave the rest to the Ten-Lords Commission from here... Even I feel like I need a rest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Possessed Spiritfarer]: ...Grahhhh, don't even think about sealing me in the matrix!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Possessed Spiritfarer]: You wretched fools! Tail, the judges, you... One day...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Possessed Spiritfarer]: ...one day, sooner or later, I'll tear you all to pieces. I'll crunch your bones to dust, sap every drop of your strength, and spit you out into the dirt where you belong...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...Cirrus?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Already forgetting me?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Wanna hug, sweety?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Tsk, your human tongues are no less poisonous than ours.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I hope you repent.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Heliobi are faced with only a single punishment — eternal imprisonment. They can lock me up, but they can't kill me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Leave the kid alone.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Kid? As a spiritfarer, he's already experienced more than you could in a lifetime.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: For as long as I'm sealed in the matrix, I will inhabit this body. The judges can stick as many talismans and pour as much enchanted water on this flesh as they like — I don't care. As long as they want to save their own, I still have a bargaining chip.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What tricks can you possibly pull as you are now?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: There are many, ... I will exist forever.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I have lived for countless years. I existed before the Alliance was even an idea. And once the Alliance has turned to dust, I will continue to exist for countless more Amber Eras.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I can wait. I'll wait for humans to let their guard down. I'll wait till the matrix drawn over Fyxestroll Garden collapses. Time and opportunity will always be on my side.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Goodbye.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...We will meet again.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I wasn't the only heliobus to escape when the Creation Furnace was destroyed... there are more of us than the mere few in Fyxestroll Garden. Where are they now? And what will they do to the Luofu?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I look forward to seeing how the Ten-Lords Commission responds in the coming days...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Cirrus stares at you in silence, and you can tell from their eyes that they are conspiring.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail... Mr. Tail...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What happened to Tail...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail distracted Cirrus... He helped us so much... B—But now he's gone...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I can't sense him anywhere... He's gone.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Huohuo...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: What kind of judge am I...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: If I were stronger, Mr. Tail wouldn't have had to sacrifice himself...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: It was because of him that I ended up in this terrible job...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...and I've thought so much about how much better my life would be if I never met him... but now that he's actually gone... I feel so empty inside...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I really am useless... I've been looking forward to this day for so long, but now that it's here... I don't feel happy at all.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Heliobi don't die that easily.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Wait, you're right... Madam Xueyi said that heliobi are eternal flames that will never burn away. Mr. Tail... He must still be out there somewhere.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: He's free now.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...I guess he is...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Don't worry,  ... I'm okay. I need to pull myself together and finish the job...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Oh, the Ten-Lords Commission contacted Miss Guinaifen's friend — Miss Sushang. I can't leave my post, so... could you let Miss Sushang know what happened...? She'll be relieved.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Thank you. I'm much better now. Could you please let Miss Sushang know what happened...? She'll be relieved.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Step DescriptionThis has now all come to an end, for the time being. Huohuo is worried about Guinaifen, and she hopes you can pass the news on soon to Guinaifen's bestie, Sushang.Not going with Guinaifen to Fyxestroll Garden may have been the correct decision for Sushang to make, but it may also be one that she might come to regret... Anyway, let's go have a chat. Aurum Alley
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: Little Gui kinda gave me an outline of what happened in the apothecary... Can you tell me more?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You explain what happened in Fyxestroll Garden to Sushang, and she seems to realize the seriousness of the situation
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: Thanks for telling me everything. I didn't think things would get so out of hand...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: I would've been able to help you if I were there too... and maybe Little Gui wouldn't have ended up in the apothecary... *sigh*
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: You don't need to worry about Little Gui. She won't be able to sit still, even in a sick ward. I'm sure she'll come find you again in no time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: I'm heading to the apothecary to check up on her. Catch you later.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: The one possessing Huohuo... seems to have disappeared. I don't know if I should be happy or sad for her...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Never mind. I've never been good at figuring out emotions.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Thank you for your assistance, Nameless. Reinforcements from the Ten-Lords Commission will be here soon, and Guinaifen will be sent to an apothecary.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Your body seems to be severely malfunctioning.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: It is only an artificial ingenium body. I can swap into another one easily. Do not worry.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I don't see Judge Hanya anywhere...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Hanya returned to the Ten-Lords Commission after you left. She is coming with the reinforcements as we speak.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Is Cirrus dead?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: No. The demon lives on. They even possessed a young spiritfarer under my command. "As Starfire Essences, the heliobi will never die" — the records in the Ten-Lords Commission's evil-binding tomes were all real...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Cirrus lost most of their power and poses no danger for the time being. But they will remain a threat for as long as they exist...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: Thankfully, the Ten-Lords Commission had prepared other sacred vessels to suppress the heliobi. We will construct a matrix all over this abandoned garden and seal the heliobi within. The Xianzhou will live to see another day.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We can leave the rest to the Ten-Lords Commission from here... Even I feel like I need a rest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Xueyi]: We can leave the rest to the Ten-Lords Commission from here... Even I feel like I need a rest.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Possessed Spiritfarer]: ...Grahhhh, don't even think about sealing me in the matrix!
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Possessed Spiritfarer]: You wretched fools! Tail, the judges, you... One day...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Possessed Spiritfarer]: ...one day, sooner or later, I'll tear you all to pieces. I'll crunch your bones to dust, sap every drop of your strength, and spit you out into the dirt where you belong...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: ...Cirrus?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Already forgetting me?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Wanna hug, sweety?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Tsk, your human tongues are no less poisonous than ours.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: I hope you repent.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Heliobi are faced with only a single punishment — eternal imprisonment. They can lock me up, but they can't kill me.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Leave the kid alone.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: Kid? As a spiritfarer, he's already experienced more than you could in a lifetime.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: For as long as I'm sealed in the matrix, I will inhabit this body. The judges can stick as many talismans and pour as much enchanted water on this flesh as they like — I don't care. As long as they want to save their own, I still have a bargaining chip.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What tricks can you possibly pull as you are now?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: There are many, ... I will exist forever.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I have lived for countless years. I existed before the Alliance was even an idea. And once the Alliance has turned to dust, I will continue to exist for countless more Amber Eras.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I can wait. I'll wait for humans to let their guard down. I'll wait till the matrix drawn over Fyxestroll Garden collapses. Time and opportunity will always be on my side.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Goodbye.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: ...We will meet again.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I wasn't the only heliobus to escape when the Creation Furnace was destroyed... there are more of us than the mere few in Fyxestroll Garden. Where are they now? And what will they do to the Luofu?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Cirrus]: I look forward to seeing how the Ten-Lords Commission responds in the coming days...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Cirrus stares at you in silence, and you can tell from their eyes that they are conspiring.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail... Mr. Tail...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: What happened to Tail...?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Tail distracted Cirrus... He helped us so much... B—But now he's gone...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I can't sense him anywhere... He's gone.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Huohuo...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: What kind of judge am I...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: If I were stronger, Mr. Tail wouldn't have had to sacrifice himself...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: It was because of him that I ended up in this terrible job...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...and I've thought so much about how much better my life would be if I never met him... but now that he's actually gone... I feel so empty inside...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: I really am useless... I've been looking forward to this day for so long, but now that it's here... I don't feel happy at all.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: Heliobi don't die that easily.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Wait, you're right... Madam Xueyi said that heliobi are eternal flames that will never burn away. Mr. Tail... He must still be out there somewhere.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: He's free now.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...I guess he is...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Don't worry,  ... I'm okay. I need to pull myself together and finish the job...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: Oh, the Ten-Lords Commission contacted Miss Guinaifen's friend — Miss Sushang. I can't leave my post, so... could you let Miss Sushang know what happened...? She'll be relieved.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Huohuo]: ...Thank you. I'm much better now. Could you please let Miss Sushang know what happened...? She'll be relieved.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: Little Gui kinda gave me an outline of what happened in the apothecary... Can you tell me more?
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Narration]: You explain what happened in Fyxestroll Garden to Sushang, and she seems to realize the seriousness of the situation
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: Thanks for telling me everything. I didn't think things would get so out of hand...
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: I would've been able to help you if I were there too... and maybe Little Gui wouldn't have ended up in the apothecary... *sigh*
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: You don't need to worry about Little Gui. She won't be able to sit still, even in a sick ward. I'm sure she'll come find you again in no time.
[Sojourners' Ghastly Reverie][Sushang]: I'm heading to the apothecary to check up on her. Catch you later.

[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: This boredom is killing me... the only entertainment I have around here is watching the insects fly by.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: Speaking of which, it seems one of them has come to visit me. I wonder, is  here to taunt me, or implement some sort of restorative justice? We'll just have to wait and see...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Still haven't given up?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: The Ten-Lords Commission judges won't abandon one of their own... but they won't let me off the hook either.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: So now I'm stuck here, condemned to eternal boredom. Hehe, I wonder which will last longer — the lifespan of my jailors, or the patience of a heliobus...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: In any case, time is on my side, so long as the Xianzhou are willing to maintain some facade of humanity.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: What are your terms of surrender?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: Surrender? Why would I do that? To you, I may as well be fighting an unwinnable battle — wasting my time away in someone else's body...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: ...but for me, the game has only just begun. The Ten-Lords Commission doesn't have any moves left... and I still have time to turn the game in my favor.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: You know, it wasn't that long ago that you and those judges would have become my pawns — if it wasn't for that meddling guard dog...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: I'm speechless.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Cirrus]: If you have nothing to say, then run along and let me be.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Yo, what's up! You're finally here! Without you, our ghost-hunting squad would be nothing!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Hey, I'm a reliable squad member too!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Sure, when you're not passed out in fear! Hehe...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Cut it out — if you keep teasing me, I—I... I'm not gonna perform my boulder-smashing trick for you anymore!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: What's this ghost-hunting squad all about?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: The official name is the "Ten-Lords Commission Special Operations Team for the Heliobi Containment Breach Incident."
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: That was the name given to us by decree of the Ten Lords. Since we managed to survive the Fyxestroll Garden incident, the Ten Lords decided to entrust us with hunting down and subduing the heliobi using our special skills.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: By decree of the Ten Lords?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: That's right — this expedition was commissioned by the Ten Lords themselves. I am unsure as to why they attached so much importance to this endeavor, but I have a theory.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Using our special skills?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Huohuo is a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission and I'm a Cloud Knight — we must answer the call to the best of our abilities. And  is an outworlder who's done great things for the sake of the Xianzhou...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: But why did Little Gui have to get dragged into this? This mission is too dangerous for a civilian!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: ...I get it. You don't think I have any special skills, so I'll just get in the way?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Every flower and tree on the Xianzhou is significant in its own way — Miss Gui has her own strengths too. As a famous street performer and livestreamer, she has precisely the skills we need to acquire intel for our mission.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: I don't have any more questions.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Miss Gui has set up a social media account under the guise of investigating paranormal phenomena and unexplained mysteries... we can use it to gather intel for our mission.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: You hear that, Sushang! I'm a key member of the squad! They said I could be a Ten-Lords Commission intelligence hawk!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Uh... I might not be a scholar, but I don't think calling someone a "hawk" is a compliment.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: The Ten-Lords Commission has specially entrusted Judge Huohuo with commanding the ghost-hunting squad, so please make sure to follow her lead in all matters related to the heliobi.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: ...Th—That's right. I won't let us down.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: After Hanya delivered the task to the ghost-hunting squad, she left to continue resolving matters at Fyxestroll Garden.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Captain Huohuo, should we start the ghost hunt now?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: C—Captain? You can just call me Huohuo.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Understood, Captain Huohuo.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: I'm really surprised that Madam Hanya asked me to be the leader of the ghost-hunting squad.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: After Tail disappeared, I thought for sure the Commission would ask me to resign, but for some reason... A—Anyway, I'll do my best to carry out my duties!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: We're all counting on you, Judge Huohuo.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Actually, I'm not sure if I can be helpful anymore...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: After Tail disappeared, I thought for sure the Commission would ask me to resign... but for some reason, Madam Hanya asked me to be the leader of the ghost-hunting squad.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: A—Anyway, I'll do my best to carry out my duties!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: As for our mission... Cirrus was locked up in Fyxestroll Garden, but there were a lot of other heliobi that escaped after the Creation Furnace was broken.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: According to the Ten-Lords Commission's understanding of heliobi behavior, they tend to roam densely populated areas in search of hosts... and wherever they go, there are bound to be reports of "supernatural phenomena."
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Little Gui, can you show us the website we'll be using for intel?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Ta-da! This is the paranormal lovers' website, Ghostly Grove.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: I've created a new account to gather paranormal experiences from the site.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: This account is your personal account, right? Is that really okay?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: The Ten-Lords Commission has to stay hidden, but I don't have to. I've been instructed to gather fans at all costs.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: That's right. As the number of fans increases, we can receive more assignments to investigate paranormal activites.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: There aren't any help requests posted yet, so let's check back in a bit. Tap here to close the page.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: I'm a new user, so I only have a few followers on this site... but based on past experience, once you get a following, people start flooding you with stories and news about paranormal activity.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: What if all the leads we get turn out to be fake?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: A lot of paranormal activity is just people in costumes.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: We have our work cut out for us, that's for sure. Sometimes a lead is obviously fake, but other times... it's hard to tell from just a few words on the Internet.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: After all, some people will make up all kinds of nonsense to attract attention.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: So we still have to go out and fact-check the leads?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Mm. Plus, the spiritfarers from the Ten-Lords Commission will be carrying out their own investigation in secret as well.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Speaking of attracting attention... how do we get a following on a paranormal activity website? Sounds like Little Gui's department — she used me in some of her performances just to draw a bigger crowd.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: That's the easy part — we just post some videos of us ghost hunting... Uh, I mean, subduing heliobi! We're working for the Ten-Lord's Commission after all — we're gonna have the best content out there!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Will the Ten-Lords agree to this?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Madam Hanya has already given us the green light. We'll record our heliobi-hunting expeditions to get more followers, and then use the intel from our followers to find more heliobi. It's like a vicious cycle... W—Wait — a virtuous cycle!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Does sound kinda effective...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Wait, aren't we supposed to be operating in secret?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Another thing we have to think about is that heliobi feed on the emotions of their hosts. They can even manipulate a host into revealing their deepest secrets...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Wouldn't posting a victim's personal information online... cause even more harm to the victim? I—I'm not trying to pick holes... just raising some concerns.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: The way I see it, "operating in secret" and "exposing the paranormal" go hand-in-hand.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: We won't reveal the names of any victims. We'll just post some pics and videos of the squad engaging in fierce battles with the supernatural! And then come up with some dramatic titles...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Like Little Gui Investigates: Ghost Tries to Scare Young Cloud Knight Girl on Creepy Road — Gets Owned..." Y'know?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: We'll turn the entire heliobi-hunting process into regular uploads. Viewers will see that there's nothing that scary about it, and there won't be any public panic!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Why are you looking at me? Want a medal or something...? It does kinda sound like a good idea...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Hee-hee, thanks bestie.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: I feel like some of you aren't convinced by the whole online ghost-hunting thing... How about this — we take a look at the leads we have so far, and pick one to try out as a test run.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Take a look — this post is getting tons of comments.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Look, it didn't take long for a help request to be posted, did it?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Help request posts usually have clues leading to heliobi. Click it to have a look.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Oh, so that's how it is. Mhm... Okay, I get the picture.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: As you can see, after completing assignments, you will receive fans and gratuity!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Best not to dilly-dally. Go accept the investigation assignment.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Let's begin our investigation!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Lady Bailu disappeared? That's nothing new — she sneaks off all the time.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: That's not the point — here, read this part...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: "One of the healers from the Alchemy Commission had Lady Bailu cornered, but then she disappeared into thin air..."
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Maybe they were seeing things.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Maybe they made it up.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Judging from the comments, there were several witnesses. Sure, Lady Bailu runs away all the time, but disappearing into thin air?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: It looks like the work of a heliobus... The heliobi are masters of manipulating the senses. There are stories of heliobi changing their shape and appearance to disguise themselves as someone else.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Okay, so what are we waiting for? Let's get moving and see if we can find some witnesses.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Before we head out, let's make sure we have our intel in order.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: If we can better understand what a heliobus wants to do — and what it's capable of doing — it'll be easier for us to help the victim.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Interviewing witnesses might give us some clues, but they won't know anything about heliobi. I... I think I have an idea... We have another source of intel we could use...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: You mean... Cirrus?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: That's right! Those heliobi were locked up in the same space for ages! They probably got to know their fellow prisoners like the back of their... Huh, I guess they don't really have hands...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Why would Cirrus help us?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: I heard from Miss Hanya that Cirrus is caught in a stalemate — the Evil Binding Matrix has trapped them. Will they really cooperate with us?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Th—The thought of seeing Cirrus sends shivers down my spine... but I bet Cirrus would be eager to see me again... they'd devour me whole if they could.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: I think Tail made a fool of Cirrus, and Cirrus has a held a grudge ever since. If we can get them worked up over it, we might be able to use them to our advantage.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Let's see... Ghast—ly Grayv... ee? Ghastly Gravy!? What kind of website is that?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: Ugh, it's Ghostly Grove, not Ghastly Gravy!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Ghostly Grove is the most renowned website for paranormal enthusiasts on the Luofu. Everyone who loves the mysterious and the unexplained knows about it.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: I used to go there to read first-hand accounts of ghost sightings whenever I needed to build up my courage.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: We can get our leads from this website and then investigate them posing as paranormal investigators.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: That means we can operate more efficiently, and with a low profile... If people started to see a spiritfarer making door-to-door visits, they might begin to panic... and that would give the heliobi even more power over their hosts.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: I'm a new user, so I only have a few followers on this site... but based on past experience, once you get a following, people start flooding you with stories and news about paranormal activity.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: What if all the leads we get turn out to be fake?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: A lot of paranormal activity is just people in costumes.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: We have our work cut out for us, that's for sure. Sometimes a lead is obviously fake, but other times... it's hard to tell from just a few words on the Internet.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: After all, some people will make up all kinds of nonsense to attract attention.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: So we still have to go out and fact-check the leads?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Mm. Plus, the spiritfarers from the Ten-Lords Commission will be carrying out their own investigation in secret as well.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Little Gui's methods can be a little unorthodox, but that's just because she has a vivid imagination... When it comes to getting things done, she's actually pretty reliable.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Why did you suddenly feel the need to say that?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Haha, I'm worried you don't trust her plan. Just relax — Little Gui is unbeatable in her area of expertise.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: You two seem to have a lot of history.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: You two sure like getting each other into trouble...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: That's just the sticky glop that holds friends together!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Guinaifen]: ...Glue.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Like the time Guinaifen dragged me to Fyxestroll Garden so I could protect her, but I was so scared I ended up fainting...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: While I was passed out, she went and caused all kinds of trouble... I neglected my duty of keeping her from making a mess of things.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: But I'll redeem myself this time! I'll make sure to protect her— uh, and also keep an eye on her...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: That being said, why did you decide to come back into this mess? Dealing with Heliobi isn't an easy task...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: I'm not sure I was given the choice...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Hahahaha, oh yeah! No one asked you if you wanted to join the ghost hunting squad — we just took you in by default.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Sure you don't wanna reconsider? It's not too late to change your mind!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Well, since I'm already here...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Good point! May as well see it through!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: I have a score to settle with Cirrus...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Oh, that's right, you were possessed by a heliobus once before — guess it wasn't a pleasant experience, was it?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: It was too short — I want to try it again.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: C'mon, don't act tough.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Not great.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: I'll bet, poor you... This time we're gonna avenge you! I'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: I'M TAINTED!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Ah! Can you not do that...? Don't worry, this time we're gonna avenge you! I'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: You come for me, you best not miss.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: What are you, a mob boss?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: You're brave, I'll give you that... Just seeing a heliobus makes me weak in the knees. You... won't laugh at me if I faint, right?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: Ugh, I can't stand the thought of those things roaming free. After what Little Gui and I went through, I'm not about to let them have their ghostly way.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: I have to redeem my honor this time! I have to protect Little Gui!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Sushang]: I have to redeem my honor this time! I have to protect Little Gui!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: , do you think we can really catch heliobi this way?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: The Internet is a very powerful tool.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: I sure hope so...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: We'll be trusting random strangers...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: That's what I'm worried about too — doesn't feel very reliable...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Let's feel it out.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: I guess we have to give it a go... I don't see any other options.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: I can't help thinking that if Tail is out there, there'll be traces of him on the Internet. He had a big personality...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Do you want Tail back?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Yes... Do you think I'm just getting myself into more trouble? It's not like we were good friends to begin with...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: ...but when Tail disappeared, my tail — my real tail... it disappeared too. Now my reflection looks weird to me, and I hate work even more than before...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: ...M—Maybe that's all just a bunch of excuses... The truth is... I miss him.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: We'll find him.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Thank you... if we're ever going to find Tail, now's the best chance we have.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: He might not be around anymore.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Mm... I guess so. Maybe he ran away, or broke into tiny pieces... Either way, I'd like to know what happened to him.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: O—Of course, finding Tail isn't our top priority right now — we need to catch and subdue all the fleeing escaped heliobi as soon as possible.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Huohuo]: Tail... The important thing right now is stopping the heliobi from causing chaos.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: , it is good to see you are doing well.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: During the Fyxestroll Garden incident, my sister gave the order to seek reinforcements. It was thanks to your support in that critical moment that we were able to get the situation under control. I wanted to thank you.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: And now this small team needs your help, too.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Where's Xueyi?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: She sustained heavy injuries in the previous incident.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Fortunately, my sister is using an ingenium body. As long as she returns to the coffin and is tended to by the spiritfarers, her life is not in jeopardy. I still worry about her, though.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Creatures of flesh and blood fear death and will always strive to preserve their life... but not my sister. Her human instinct for survival is slipping away — she sees herself more as a "tool," driving her body to the point of total exhaustion.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Every time she fights like that, I can't bear to watch.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Can we really handle this better than the Ten-Lords Commission?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: In most matters, I would say no. But when dealing with heliobi... I think the answer is quite clear.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: The Ten-Lords Commission have long specialized in suppressing abominations, but they were negligent in guarding against the dangers of the Creation Furnace. Once it became a problem, the spiritfarers and aurumatons were powerless against the heliobi, proving that the traditional means of subduing them were no longer effective.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: As fate would have it, the girl we unwittingly rescued many years ago became the key to defeating Cirrus.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: After this is all settled, we intend to make contact with the Xianzhou Zhuming. That ship is under the influence of the mythical Reignbow Arbiter — the people there are able to coexist with the heliobi and at the same time be free from their manipulation. We hope that from them we can learn the art of breaking free from the influence of the heliobi.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Is it true that the Ten-Lords Commission is located in... the netherworld?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Did you really think we were messengers from another plane visiting the world of the living? Hehe, how cute of you.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: And maybe we are... don't get too close, or you might turn into a ghost too.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: The precise location of the Ten-Lords Commission is highly confidential... but you have contributed much to the Xianzhou and are very close to the secret. If you wish to know more about it, I will have to ask you to spend time with our ghost-hunting squad.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: About Huohuo and Tail...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: A judge of the Ten-Lords Commission has no past. Once one has entered the service of the commission, all links with the outside world are severed...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: However, since you are now a member of the squad, and in the interest of everyone working together, it's best that we know each other a little better... — I'll tell you some of the secrets I know.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: After Ignamar was defeated by the general in a great battle, the Ten-Lords Commission was ordered to seal away the heliobi fragments. To make them atone for their actions, most of the heliobi were sealed inside the Creation Furnace.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Decades ago, the Ten-Lords Commission was asked to investigate an unusual case — a Foxian girl's tail had been consumed by a strange fire of unknown origin... so we set out, ready to subdue whatever foul demon awaited us.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: It turned out that the fire was none other than a heliobus. The remaining fragments of Ignamar — the heliobi — had found some way to escape from their furnace prison.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: That heliobus's power was weakened to the brink of death, but he was kept alive thanks to the kindness of the Foxian girl. Gradually, he regained his strength and rekindled his desire to manipulate humans.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Normally, I would have just purged the heliobus and sent it back into the furnace. But Huohuo's body was too frail and weak to perform a purging. The best I could do without harming her was to inscribe a talisman seal — enough to subdue the thing living inside her, at least for a while.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: The Ten-Lords Commission took Huohuo in as a spiritfarer apprentice, teaching her the arts of purgation and ghost hunting. This way the Commission could keep an eye on Huohuo — and ensure that she wasn't taken over by the heliobus.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: But Tail doesn't seem like an enemy.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Perhaps all those long years with Huohuo have bestowed upon that heliobus some form of human compassion. Though Tail has never given up on attempting to break free of his bonds or usurping his host, he has fought against his own kind to protect Huohuo.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: Tail betrayed his own kind.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: You could say that. Who would have thought Tail would have sacrificed himself to defeat Cirrus? Granted, heliobi have no obligation to be loyal to one another, but Tail's willingness to side with Huohuo is significant.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Narration]: This has to be the strangest group of people on the Xianzhou...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: I would save the jokes for later! As the saying goes, with great work comes great rewards. The Ten-Lords Commission will compensate you accordingly.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: I've wondered at times what the Luofu should give the Nameless in return for their great deeds...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: Alas, questions like that are above my pay grade. That is for the Ten Lords and the General to figure out.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: I leave the matters of the ghost-hunting squad in your hands. If you have further questions, just ask Huohuo.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (I)][Hanya]: As always, I have mountains of paperwork to finish... Piles of paper... I'll never get it all done...

[Twins][Cirrus]: Ugh, this tedium... even the insects can't hold my attention any longer. I wonder if these ones will prove to be more entertaining?
[Twins][Sushang]: Cirrus, we've come to ask you a few questions. I hope you'll be cooperative.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Oh, if it isn't the little girl who fainted in Fyxestroll Garden the moment she encountered the heliobi? Already talking to me like a detective, are you?
[Twins][Sushang]: Hey! Where's my sword? Y—You just wait...
[Twins][Narration]: Can we destroy Cirrus already?
[Twins][Cirrus]: Hmph, there are plenty of beings in this garden that would like to kill me... Why don't you line up one-by-one and take turns trying?
[Twins][Huohuo]: D—Don't be ridiculous... We can't allow the host to be harmed.
[Twins][Narration]: Don't let them get to you.
[Twins][Sushang]: Okay, okay... I just wish I could teach them a lesson!
[Twins][Huohuo]: Cirrus... you must be unhappy with how things turned out, right?
[Twins][Cirrus]: What do you want from me, little fox girl? You want to know what happened to the guard dog? He turned to ashes a long time ago!
[Twins][Huohuo]: I... I don't care about that at all... but I can't help but notice — you managed to escape the furnace, and now you're stuck here, unable to move an inch, while the other heliobi are roaming around the Luofu enjoying themselves... Must be quite frustrating.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Hahaha... You want me to assist you and betray my own kind?
[Twins][Narration]: Cirrus stays silent, sizing everyone up through the eyes of the spiritfarer they possess. Finally, they decide to talk.
[Twins][Cirrus]: ...I can do that — under one condition... I wish to arrange a challenge — one akin to the struggle between the great heliobus Ignamar and the general of the Luofu. As long as you can bring me the current general... anything can be negotiated.
[Twins][Huohuo]: The general...?
[Twins][Cirrus]: What, is that too much to ask? It seems the judge here doesn't have what it takes to negotiate with a heliobus!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: That's just another way of saying they don't want to cooperate...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Huh? Wait, Huohuo, you can't seriously be thinking about—
[Twins][Huohuo]: Deal! I'll submit a request to the Seat of Divine Foresight.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Bring me the current general of the Luofu, and we can talk.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Oh? What do we have here? A Nameless, a Cloud Knight, a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, and a street performer? Quite the group.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Wow, the general recognizes me? I didn't realize I was so famous!
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Haha, my retainer, Yanqing, has mentioned you. You are one of the only people on the Luofu that was able to deprive him of his sword.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Huh? Oh! I—I remember... I should apologize — I did a sword-swallowing performance on the spur of the moment, but forgot to return the sword to him when I left the stage...
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: So, what wind has brought you to the Seat of Divine Foresight?
[Twins][Narration]: Huohuo tells Jing Yuan about the heliobi crisis and the Cirrus's demand.
[Twins][Huohuo]: General, we know you have important matters to attend to, and the Ten-Lords Commission shouldn't be bothering you with something as trivial as the heliobi... but if we allow those creatures to roam freely, I'm afraid...
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: I heard stories of a skirmish between a previous general and a monster of sorts — I'd always assumed they were an old wives tale. I never imagined the villain of such tales would come to my doorstep seeking revenge. I must say, it seems a bit unfair that I should assume the debt for a conflict I had no involvement in.
[Twins][Narration]: It wasn't your fight to begin with.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Precisely! In principle, the instigator should bear the burden. Still...
[Twins][Narration]: Masterstroke them! Please?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: It would appear you are eager to see me assume the debt.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: General Teng Xiao is a venerated predecessor. If I am to honor his legacy, then sitting idly by is not an option. If an audience with the general of the Luofu is requested, then I will honor such a request.
[Twins][Huohuo]: General, heliobi are vile creatures capable of taking over the bodies of mortals... If you're unsure...
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: I appreciate the Ten-Lords Commission having such high regard for my welfare. It is true I am rather inexperienced when it comes to heliobi, but as general of the Luofu, I cannot look on while these fugitive creatures wreak havoc on the populace.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: I still have some paperwork that needs attending to — once I am finished, I will make my way to Fyxestroll Garden without delay.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: As soon as I finish my paperwork for the day, I will make my way to Fyxestroll Garden. Please, go ahead of me.
[Twins][Cirrus]: I have never seen this one before... Human, who are you?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Heliobus, is it not your deepest wish to hold a rematch with the general of the Luofu? I have come to grant you an audience.
[Twins][Narration]: He's the present-day general!
[Twins][Narration]: This is General Teng Xiao's successor!
[Twins][Huohuo]: Cirrus, we have brought you the person you wish to see. This is General Jing Yuan, the one who now sits at the Seat of Divine Foresight.
[Twins][Cirrus]: ...This is the current general of the Luofu?
[Twins][Cirrus]: Look at that expression — he's barely half-awake! Where is General Teng Xiao? Why did he choose such a lightweight to take over for him? I suppose it's already too late for the Xianzhou to rid themselves of this clown...
[Twins][Cirrus]: Very well then, General Jing Yuan — how about we settle our score right here in Fyxestroll Garden? If I win, I must be free to come and go as I please...
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: I agreed to grant you an audience, not meet you in combat.
[Twins][Cirrus]: ...What? You refuse? You won't fight me!?
[Twins][Cirrus]: He comes here after I demand a rematch, and won't even fight... Is he conceding that I already won? No, there can be no victory in eschewing combat — human logic negates it...
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: You misunderstand — I came for a rematch. It's just that... you are not a worthy opponent.
[Twins][Cirrus]: WHAT!? UNWORTHY!?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Teng Xiao, as general of the Luofu, was commander-in-chief of the Cloud Knights. Ignamar commanded the heliobi. The two were as great as the sky and the earth — equally matched like yin and yang. It is only natural that they were worthy opponents.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: As it stands, I am the general of the Luofu... but you are no Ignamar. Merely a prisoner. If you wish to engage me in battle, you must follow my rules. Defeat my army — only then will I grant you the fight you seek.
[Twins][Cirrus]: ...Your army?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: That's right. You must defeat my four companions gathered here — then you will have proved yourself a worthy opponent.
[Twins][Huohuo]: Wait... he means us!? W—W—W—We'll be okay, right?
[Twins][Narration]: We got this.
[Twins][Sushang]: That's right! For us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
[Twins][Narration]: That escalated quickly...
[Twins][Sushang]: We'll be fine! For us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
[Twins][Narration]: Can we practice our masterstrokes first?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Why is the general putting his trust in us? I'm too young to die!
[Twins][Cirrus]: ...So I only need to beat your pawns here?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: It would serve you well not to underestimate them. They are as skilled in combat as they are tenacious in spirit. I worry they might pose a problem for you.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: If you win, you can have your rematch. If you lose, you will answer one question of their choice — no lies, no tricks. Can you accept these terms?
[Twins][Cirrus]: ...
[Twins][Cirrus]: It's a deal! The game is set — this platform will be our chessboard, and the fighters will be the pieces!
[Twins][Cirrus]: Hmph, trying to humiliate me with lowly pawns...
[Twins][Cirrus]: No matter then, I have my pawns to play...
[Twins][Cirrus]: Heed my command!
[Twins][Cirrus]: Receive my power!
[Twins][Cirrus]: Now you will experience the might of the heliobi!
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: You've lost, Cirrus.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Hmph, don't get complacent — if I had all of Ignamar's power, I'd never have lost to the likes of you!
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Should you decide to try again, my offer still stands... but you must defeat them.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Then what are we waiting for!
[Twins][Huohuo]: Not so fast! Before we fight again, you need to answer one question, like you promised.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Pesky devil of a girl... Alright, what's your question?
[Twins][Huohuo]: Look... is this something a heliobus could have done?
[Twins][Narration]: You show Cirrus the post about Bailu's sudden disappearance
[Twins][Cirrus]: There are countless heliobi that escaped from the Creation Furnace, and every one of them could have done such a thing. It could have been vengeance, curiosity, or simply hunger... So how would I know which one abducted your Dragon Lady?
[Twins][Cirrus]: Of course, I do have my suspicions. For example, Luxie...
[Twins][Narration]: What kind of heliobus is Luxie?
[Twins][Narration]: Sounds like a childish name for a heliobus.
[Twins][Narration]: Sounds like a made-up name to me.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Disbelieve it if you like — that's up to you. Unlike humans, I get no joy from telling lies.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Luxie loves mischief. They give no thought to interfering in mortal affairs — their only concerns are entertainment and freedom. Among all the fragments of Ignamar, the one most likely to abduct your precious Dragon Lady... would be Luxie.
[Twins][Cirrus]: We were sealed away for a thousand years — it's been ages since we last tasted the joys and sorrows of the world of humans. I'm sure Luxie was eager to find a new friend and wander the world with them.
[Twins][Huohuo]: I think they're telling the truth... Heliobi do have different personalities, and they can be influenced by the personality of their host.
[Twins][Huohuo]: If a heliobus possesses a great warrior, they might gradually take on a braver, fiercer persona... and if their host is a playful child, they may adopt a childlike spirit.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Hmm... "wander the world with them." It sounds like Lady Bailu would've been an ideal target — she's always running off to play in Aurum Alley.
[Twins][Huohuo]: Mm... This intel should be a big help.
[Twins][Cirrus]: Hey! We're not done here! You still owe me a fight!
[Twins][Narration]: We'll get to it sooner or later.
[Twins][Narration]: You wouldn't win anyway.
[Twins][Narration]: We have to run some errands first — be patient!
[Twins][Cirrus]: You bunch of meat bags! One minor victory and you think you're something special! Come on, show me what you've got!
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: The clues are all pointing in the same direction now. It would be wise to strike while the iron is hot.
[Twins][Sushang]: Thank you for your help, general. Let's get going!
[Twins][Cirrus]: Are you done running around yet?
[Twins][Narration]: Not quite.
[Twins][Narration]: I'm just stopping by to say hi.
[Twins][Narration]: Miss us?
[Twins][Cirrus]: Hah, spare me! Have you forgotten that I once controlled you like a puppet?
[Twins][Cirrus]: I provided you with information as promised — why am I still empty-handed?
[Twins][Cirrus]: Tsk, don't bother me again until you're ready to fight!
[Twins][Cirrus]: You'll be begging for a rematch later... just you wait.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: The heliobi are like a flame that burns eternal, with no need for sustenance. But alas, their curiosity got the best of them, and they became prisoners of humans. It is a pity.
[Twins][Narration]: Do you sympathize with them?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: ...I lament that we share the same weaknesses.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Our situation is no different from that of the heliobi. From the moment we gain sentience, we are driven by desire and instinct, bound to our destiny, moving unceasingly towards our own demise.
[Twins][Narration]: Aren't you afraid we'll be defeated by them...
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: The most important thing in a soldier is one's intuition for victory or defeat. And you have given me confidence in victory.
[Twins][Narration]: Why is Cirrus so obsessed with fighting the general of the Luofu?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: The ancient legends recount that the Xianzhou once faced an invasion by a great enemy that threatened the annihilation of every race aboard the Xianzhou ships. In order to save the Alliance, a hero made a pact with the Flint Emperor — the predecessor of all heliobi.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: The Flint Emperor would aid the Xianzhou in battle, and if they were victorious, the hero and their followers would lose their physical bodies for eternity.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: When the fighting had ceased, none of the heroes survived, and the Flint Emperor was gravely wounded. Thus, the pact was unable to be fulfilled. As the centuries came and went, the story faded from memory. But the heliobi remember.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: They hold claim to this debt for all time. The great battle between General Teng Xiao and Ignamar was fought largely for this reason.
[Twins][Narration]: You're not going back to the Seat of Divine Foresight?
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: Aiding the Ten-Lords Commission in subduing the heliobi is a legitimate reason to take a leave of absence.
[Twins][Jing Yuan]: I shall treat it as a vacation and enjoy the scenery of Fyxestroll Garden — though I must admit, the wind here does chill the bones.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Ahh, I haven't been here for a while — it's nice to be back in the old stomping ground.
[Twins][Sushang]: Oh yeah? Since you're so familiar with the place, you can lead the way and conduct the interviews!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Did I hear something from the peanut gallery?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Look! Those two are wearing Alchemy Commission uniforms. They're probably looking for the Dragon Lady...
[Twins][Huohuo]: Lady Bailu disappeared into thin air — they must be pretty confused. Remember, we have to keep our identities secret when we interview them... and don't mention anything about the heliobi — people might start panicking...
[Twins][Sushang]: Don't worry Judge Huohuo. Effective communication with the public is one of the basic skills of a Cloud Knight~
[Twins][Sushang]: Hello there! Judging by your clothing, you two must be healers from the Alchemy Commission. My name is Sushang — I'm a Cloud Knight Soldier. Are you looking for the Dragon Lady who suddenly disappeared?
[Twins][Experienced Medic]: Uh... Even the Cloud Knights are getting involved? Did you file a report or something?
[Twins][Young Medic]: Report? I haven't said a word to the Realm-Keeping Commission, let alone the Cloud Knights. People would think we were crazy if we reported this... There's something fishy going on — how did the Cloud Knights find out?
[Twins][Sushang]: Uh... Hah, good question! So, actually, we're affiliated with the Ten—
[Twins][Guinaifen]: The Tenth Squad! Cloud Knight Security Squad Ten, to be precise, hehe... We patrol the streets and respond to all kinds of unexpected incidents! It's grunt work, essentially...
[Twins][Young Medic]: I can relate. We're no stranger to grunt work ourselves.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Anyway, we heard about the Dragon Lady's disappearance, so we hurried over to see if we could help.
[Twins][Young Medic]: Oh! We know this  here —  from the Astral Express. I've heard the Dragon Lady mention  before.
[Twins][Narration]: She and I are best buddies.
[Twins][Narration]: Am I that famous?
[Twins][Narration]: That's right, I'm her long-term meal ticket!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Psst, be normal!
[Twins][Experienced Medic]: Well, it's great that you all are willing to help. But we haven't actually figured it out what exactly is going on...
[Twins][Young Medic]: Just when we had her cornered, the Dragon Lady disappeared with a "bang."
[Twins][Experienced Medic]: And while we were chasing her, we saw two of her! It really is a mystery.
[Twins][Narration]: It must be cloudhymn magic.
[Twins][Young Medic]: That's what I was just saying! ...But can cloudhymn magic really do that?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: It sure can! This Foxian beside me... well, she's actually the Xianzhou's top expert on intangible cultural heritage — she's super knowledgeable about cloudhymn magic. Huohuo, could you share some expert insight with us?
[Twins][Huohuo]: Huh? Umm... Ah, yes! I—I'm a very professional expert... and I'd be happy to share my expert knowledge! In fact, Cloudhymn magic isn't the only magic out there that can achieve such feats — we Foxians can use our foxfire to make ourselves invisible!
[Twins][Narration]: Maybe you were experiencing double vision?
[Twins][Experienced Medic]: I'm not even 500 years old yet! My eyes are as sharp as they come!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Hmm, maybe you're overworked. Alchemy Commission healers are saving people 24/7 — I'd start seeing things too if I were that busy. As the face of medicinal mastery on the Xianzhou, you two need to be living healthier lifestyles.
[Twins][Young Medic]: Huh, you really get what we're up against... After this is behind us, I say we take a holiday and get rested up.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: So where did you last see Lady Bailu?
[Twins][Young Medic]: On that road there... and I swear I can hear a child giggling whenever I walk by. Must be the wind...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Be sure to get some rest! We'll take over from here. Lady Bailu must have seen you and gone off to hide... but with her old friend  here, maybe she'll be willing to come back out.
[Twins][Experienced Medic]: Fantastic. Well, we'll leave you to it.
[Twins][Young Medic]: *sigh* Why does the Dragon Lady always have to run off... I swear they should be paying us extra for this...
[Twins][Experienced Medic]: Hah! I should get worker's comp for listening to you complaining all day. If you don't like the work, you can always transfer to the military.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Lady Bailu! Lady Bailu, where are you?
[Twins][Sushang]: Lady Bailu, come out and play with us!
[Twins][Huohuo]: ...W—Why are there two of her?
[Twins][Bailu]: They're asking us to play with them!
[Twins][Narration]: Pseudo-Bailu: Silly-head, they're trying to trick you! They're just gonna catch you and take you back!
[Twins][Narration]: Pseudo-Bailu: I know! Let's play a game called "don't let anyone catch us!"
[Twins][Bailu]: Run!
[Twins][Sushang]: Ghoooooooost!!!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Seriously...? That ghost twin was one thing, but your screaming nearly sent me to the grave...
[Twins][Sushang]: Ah, sorry! But seriously — I knew it was a heliobus, but seeing double Bailu like that sent shivers down my spine!
[Twins][Huohuo]: I—It's okay, Miss. Sushang... I've worked in the Ten-Lords Commission for many years now, but I'm still not used to their tricks...
[Twins][Narration]: How do we catch them now?
[Twins][Huohuo]: They're eluding our senses, but they won't have gone far... We just need to look around.
[Twins][Huohuo]: I can hear laughter, but where's it coming from...?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Ugh, now I'm starting to get the heebie jeebies...
[Twins][Sushang]: You can say that again...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: It seems to be coming from this room. I'll open the door and take a look. Everyone, stay on high alert.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Huh? It won't open.
[Twins][Narration]: You try to open the door but it won't budge.
[Twins][Narration]: You try to ram the door open but it won't budge.
[Twins][Narration]: You try to kick the door open, but it won't budge, and your feet hurt.
[Twins][Sushang]: Strange... Is this also the work of the heliobus?
[Twins][Huohuo]: They must know that we're following... but now that we know its hiding spot, it's time to use this.
[Twins][Huohuo]: This is the Harmonic Chime. It's an item that the Ten-Lords Commission forged to help deal with the heliobi after the Fyxestroll Garden incident.
[Twins][Huohuo]: Heliobi create illusions to isolate their victims... but if we ring this chime, our thought-waves will synchronize with those of the heliobus. As for how it works... I'm afraid that would take the rest of the day to explain.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: In other words, we'll be able to enter the heliobus's illusion?
[Twins][Huohuo]: Exactly... but once we're inside the illusion, we'll still have to figure out a way to catch Luxie.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: , you're the powerhouse of this team, we'll leave the door to you.
[Twins][Narration]: Doors are my specialty.
[Twins][Huohuo]: Mm... please be careful.
[Twins][Narration]: Why, how generous of you...
[Twins][Huohuo]: Mm... be careful not to hurt yourself.
[Twins][Narration]: I'm a jack of many trades, but master of none...
[Twins][Sushang]: Come on, you're too modest for your own good.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: When you're ready, ring the chime — we'll all charge in together.
[Twins][Narration]: I need a moment to get ready.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Don't wait too long. They might make a run for it before we get there.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: I never thought this would be behind the door...
[Twins][Huohuo]: Remember, it's just a heliobus illusion...
[Twins][Sushang]: Hey, you over there! Release Lady Bailu!
[Twins][Narration]: Pseudo-Bailu: Don't be a bunch of fun-suckers! She doesn't wanna let anyone take her away!
[Twins][Bailu]: Luxie, they came here looking for me... It's starting to get dark, maybe it's time for me to go back now?
[Twins][Luxie]: Lulu, didn't we say before that we wouldn't let any grown-ups find us? And never let them take us home? Why... why did you change your mind?
[Twins][Bailu]: Hmm... you're right! Grown-ups break their promises, but we don't!
[Twins][Luxie]: That's right! Remember, if you ever get hungry, I can conjure up anything you like — berrypheasant skewers, startaro bubble tea — you name it. We have it right here!
[Twins][Bailu]: Okay! Make some right now!
[Twins][Luxie]: Not yet — why don't we play a game first? You bad guys over there, okay? You're gonna be in the game too!
[Twins][Luxie]: Lulu, let's make a run for it — if we escape from them, I'll conjure up all of your favorite snacks and drinks!
[Twins][Bailu]: Wow! Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!
[Twins][Luxie]: We're free from the grown-ups! We can play all day every day!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Wait, stop!
[Twins][Luxie]: I just wanna play a little longer! What's so bad about that?
[Twins][Bailu]: Why do I have to live the way grown-ups do?
[Twins][Bailu]: Grown-ups are always saying "study now and have fun later..."
[Twins][Bailu]: ...but the grown-ups I see at the Alchemy Commission never have time for fun!
[Twins][Luxie]: Stop chasing us!
[Twins][Bailu]: Can't you just let me have some fun!?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: That door over there is the only way out... We'd better close it...
[Twins][Sushang]: Whew... By the Arbiter... They sure know... how to run...
[Twins][Huohuo]: That's... the power of a... heliobus!
[Twins][Sushang]: ...Catch your breath... before you pass out...
[Twins][Sushang]: Let's... let's try a new strategy... I don't think we can beat them like this. We need to use our heads...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: ...Sushang's... gonna use her head...? Now we're really done for...
[Twins][Narration]: I barely broke a sweat.
[Twins][Sushang]: Then... good for you! But you should probably catch your breath first... I could hear you panting from a mile away.
[Twins][Narration]: I think I'm hyperventilating.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Ha, you're fine! Just take a breather...
[Twins][Narration]: Anyone bring a hunting trap?
[Twins][Huohuo]: Huh? We can't hunt the Dragon Lady like a wild beast...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Wait, I have an idea! How about we use a little reverse psychology? Instead of chasing Lady Bailu, we get her to come to us!
[Twins][Sushang]: Are you serious? Does that little dragon girl look like she's gonna come running over to us?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Chasing Bailu around like this reminds me of something I saw back home when I was a child. On my home planet, resources were scarce, and if you wanted to eat meat you had to risk your life by going deep into the mines to hunt an animal called a sky mink.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Sky minks fly so nimbly and are so alert that even the quickest of hands will have a hard time catching them.
[Twins][Narration]: Why are we having story time all of a sudden?
[Twins][Narration]: Did you get the meat? How does the story end?
[Twins][Sushang]: Gather round children!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Ugh, don't interrupt! Hear me out. The sky mink's ecology is unique — it lives in symbiosis with a venomous creature called a shrieking lizard. When a sky mink goes out to feed, it lets the lizard protect its young.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: So we used to go to sky mink nests to catch shrieking lizards, instead. When a shrieking lizard gets caught, it calls to the sky mink with a loud shriek to warn it to return to the nest and protect its young... which of course, led the sky mink right to us.
[Twins][Narration]: Sounds a little cruel...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Well, the competition for survival went two ways — shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom, and failure to take proper precautions cost many a hunter their life.
[Twins][Narration]: Sounds pretty smart...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: I'd hesitate to call it that. Shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom — many people lost their lives trying to catch a tiny morsel of meat for dinner.
[Twins][Sushang]: Nice story. But what's it got to do with chasing Lady Bailu?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Isn't it obvious? If we can catch one Bailu, the other will come running to us!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: I remember one of the judges had a precious item called a Lunaumbra Gourd, which could absorb and imprison heliobi... Uh, come to think of it, I think that's the thing I smashed... I wonder if they fixed it?
[Twins][Huohuo]: Actually, I have one with me, but it's only effective when a heliobus is close by.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Nice! In that case, you can take the gourd and camp out in a corner — the rest of us will chase Lady Bailu back over here.
[Twins][Sushang]: If we catch Lady Bailu, will Luxie really follow her into our trap? Do heliobi really have a sense of loyalty to their victims?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Who knows? Cirrus said that Luxie is kinda childlike — it's worth a try.
[Twins][Huohuo]: The Lunaumbra Gourd is in place. If we can chase Lady Bailu to this spot, we should be able to catch her...
[Twins][Huohuo]: Umm... b—be careful, okay?
[Twins][Luxie]: Why do grown-ups always say that life is harder for them. So weird...
[Twins][Luxie]: Weren't grown-ups kids once too?
[Twins][Luxie]: Would you spoil the fun for younger you just because older you isn't happy?
[Twins][Bailu]: Exactly!
[Twins][Bailu]: Why do they always talk about things I don't understand!
[Twins][Bailu]: I just wanna have fun!
[Twins][Bailu]: Lemme go! I don't wanna be locked in here!
[Twins][Huohuo]: Lady Bailu — please calm down. You're not yourself right now — you're being influenced by a heliobus.
[Twins][Bailu]: You're lying! I never had playmates. Today I finally found one, and you guys are trying to take them away...
[Twins][Luxie]: Grown-ups are so mean! As soon as they see children having fun, they wanna ruin it!
[Twins][Narration]: Hee-hee! I'm a big meany head!
[Twins][Narration]: You're right. Sorr... Sowwie!
[Twins][Huohuo]: Careful! Don't let them manipulate you.
[Twins][Narration]: Yo boss, maybe we should let her off with a warning this time?
[Twins][Huohuo]: Careful! Don't let them manipulate you.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Phew, sure enough, they walked right into our trap.
[Twins][Luxie]: Hmph, I was considering letting you join the club and have fun with us... but since you're so determined to spoil everything... I'm afraid we'll have to settle our differences through violence.
[Twins][Luxie]: Yes, violence, the only language you grown-ups know how to speak, right? The one you use when you're telling us off!
[Twins][Luxie]: I'm sorry, Lulu... Th—The grown-ups won, I can't play with you anymore...
[Twins][Bailu]: Luxie, we said we'd never go back with the grown-ups! They break their promises, but we can't!
[Twins][Luxie]: There's nothing I can do about it... playtime can't go on forever...
[Twins][Luxie]: ...but we still had lots of fun — let's play again next time!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: There won't be a next time! Huohuo, you know what to do.
[Twins][Bailu]: Luxie, how long before the next time we can play together?
[Twins][Luxie]: We both have many years ahead of us, so in that sense it won't be long at all... but for now I have to leave with these grown-ups!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Alright, alright. Lady Bailu, it's getting late — you need to go home now.
[Twins][Narration]: As the heliobus disappears, Bailu's eyes regain their clarity. She has retook control of herself.
[Twins][Bailu]: I... everything's so fuzzy... Did I do something bad?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: No need to feel bad, Lady Bailu. You were in a dreamworld — none of it was your fault.
[Twins][Bailu]: But... but... I made everyone chase after me for so long... I shouldn't have done that...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: It's only natural to want to escape when strict rules are being forced on you. I know there are a lot of grown-ups trying to control you — telling you what you can and can't do... they're the ones to blame.
[Twins][Bailu]: I was ready to apologize to everyone... but now you've made me forget what I wanted to say.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Apologize for what? You know, you and me have a lot in common. I'm almost a grown-up now, but I still miss my childhood days and running about barefoot.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: My big brother used to boss me around... He'd give me chores, constantly telling me to grow up, that kind of thing... Then one day, I decided to rebel. I ran away to prove that I could get by without my family... and eventually settled on the Xianzhou.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Whether it's a Dragon Lady like you or an ordinary person like me, I feel like many people's lives follow a similar trajectory.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: One day, you'll have the strength to leave your current situation and move on to the next phase... In the meantime, I suggest you try and cherish the good rather than apologize for the bad.
[Twins][Bailu]: Hehe, alright, alright, I don't want everyone to feel too sorry for me... Hey, did you ever think about joining the Alchemy Commission as a psychotherapist?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Geez, and there I was pouring my heart out... Now I feel like this kid's lived longer than I have...
[Twins][Huohuo]: Umm, c— can we not linger around here too long? This place is really spooky... Maybe we can chat somewhere else?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Truth be told... Luxie didn't seem as evil as the other heliobi we've seen.
[Twins][Sushang]: They sure made us run, though. If I ever have to run like that again on the job, I'm filing for worker's comp.
[Twins][Huohuo]: Heliobi don't really fall under "good" or "evil" — they just act according to their desires and emotions. I hope the others will be just as easy to subdue.
[Twins][Narration]: I had fun.
[Twins][Narration]: I nearly had a heart attack.
[Twins][Narration]: Just glad it's all over.
[Twins][Bailu]: I should go surrender myself to those two medics — they were looking so hard to find me...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Wait!
[Twins][Bailu]: Huh? What is it?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: We're going to make a post about this "paranormal incident" online to attract more followers — it'll help us get more intel.
[Twins][Narration]: You tell Bailu about the website Ghostly Grove
[Twins][Bailu]: Oh, I get it... We can't just tell the public that the Dragon Lady was possessed by a heliobus, right? So... we won't mention my name right? And we'll make up a headline?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: That's right, we wanna report this incident like it's a paranormal phenomenon — the more exaggerated the better — and then announce that it was solved by our ghost-hunting squad! Then we add on a few photos and videos — it'll be sure to get lots of views!
[Twins][Bailu]: Um... That's great and all, but I'm not good at making stuff up on the spot...
[Twins][Guinaifen]: I heard that you helped Mr. Xiyan write stories before — you must be an expert wordsmith!
[Twins][Narration]: I'm afraid you're overestimating me...
[Twins][Narration]: Aren't you the one in charge of social media engagement?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: It's all a team effort. Come on, help me think of something!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Sounds good. Let's have a think about it.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Here's a picture I just snuck for a post.
[Twins][Sushang]: That's a nice shot, but when did you take it?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Don't worry about it too much. You people need remember to take more pictures too, okay? More pics equal more fans.
[Twins][Huohuo]: N—Next up is a little creative liberty, am I right?
[Twins][Guinaifen]: A plain and simple retelling of a supernatural experience won't get any fans interested. We need to add a little pizzazz.
[Twins][Huohuo]: The Ten-Lords Commission also hopes to reduce the panic caused by the escaped heliobi. So, adding in some embellishment would be good...

[Twins][Narration]: Who is this body double for Lady Bailu? Find out now!
[Twins][Guinaifen]: Hmmm... I say that's a good title. What does everyone think? Alrighty then, it's decided.
[Twins][Guinaifen]: You should go back soon, Lady Bailu. Those two medics have had a rough day.
[Twins][Bailu]: Okay, I'm going back now. Thanks for the rescue~
[Twins][Sushang]: Case closed! I never knew catching heliobi would require so much work...
[Twins][Huohuo]: We're not done yet... Madam Hanya said that once we've subdued a heliobus, we should return to Fyxestroll Garden and lock them inside one of the Evil Binding Matrix's suppression towers.
[Twins][Narration]: Expel evil and capture stray spirits... With the support of the Ten Lords Commission's spiritfarers, you seal the heliobi within the Lunaumbra Gourd.
[Twins][Sushang]: It's over! Whew... Now I can finally get some rest.
[Twins][Huohuo]: But there are still lots of heliobi roaming around out there... we can't rest for too long.
[Twins][Narration]: Let tomorrow worry about tomorrow.
[Twins][Sushang]: I couldn't agree more.
[Twins][Sushang]: I'd rather focus on resting first... I need to wait for my heart rate to recover before I go chasing another heliobus.
[Twins][Narration]: Let's continue in a group chat.
[Twins][Narration]: Remember to share the account updates.

[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Huohuo]: Hello. Let's get started with today's operations.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: The Ten-Lords Commission Special Operations Team for the Heliobus Containment Breach Incident — A.K.A the ghost-hunting squad — is ready for action! Yeahhh⁓!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: Yeah...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Huohuo]: ...?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Yeah!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: Looks like we're the only ones in good spirits today...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Clocking in...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: Yo, why the exhaustion? You look like the officers over at the Realm-Keeping Commission.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Can I switch to a four-day week?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: I don't think that was included in the job posting. Actually, I don't think there ever was a job posting.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: I'm sleepy... Little Gui, what kind of magical elixir did you take to make you so energetic?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: Every time I see our follower count increase, I get so excited I can't even sleep — it works better than any kind of tea or coffee.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: Well aren't you lucky. As soon as I closed my eyes, I dreamt of endless running and circling and chasing after Lady Bailu... it was even more exhausting than doing it in real life.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: Sushang, you slept for an entire day!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: Catching ghosts is a night job — it only makes sense to sleep during the day.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: I have an idea — how about we all just pretend that I've been possessed by a sleep ghost, let me sleep for another ten hours, and then call it a day's work?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: You sound like someone I know...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: A certain Celestial Jade-playing Divination Commission employee, perhaps...?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: Divination Commission? Celestial Jade? Shouldn't they be doing... divinations?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Sounds like you've spent time with Qingque...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Huohuo]: That's the Celestial Jade player over at Exalting Sanctum! Whenever I pass through on official business, I always see her with loads of other players.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: Even a judge knows her! Her reputation sure does precede her...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: Who is this, exactly?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Guinaifen]: It's this girl. Here, look at this post.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: I'm late as usual for work today and everyone's acting sus)
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: ...I take my job seriously! I'd never post something like "late as usual" on a public forum.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Huohuo]: Miss Sushang, I think you missed the interesting part...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Huohuo]: The description in this comment is really suspicious, it definitely sounds like heliobi activity to me... and if heliobi have managed to infiltrate the Divination Commission, that spells big trouble for the Luofu.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Sushang]: You're right... Maybe we should contact Miss Qingque and warn her not to go to work today.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Since when does she need reminding to skip work?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Huohuo]: That's a good idea. We should send out a message, or people's curiosity will get the better of them.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: I'll do it.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: : Is everything all right on your end?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Don't go to the Divination Commission
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: : Stay away from the Divination Commission for now. It could be dangerous there.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Qingque]: ?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Qingque]: Don't worry. I just saw what happened and posted about it as soon as I took a left turn out the door.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Qingque]: So, what exactly has happened? Why is everyone looking so sluggish?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: Guard the gate.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: : Guard the gate, Qingque. Don't let anyone in or out of the Divination Commission.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Narration]: : Stay safe. We'll be right there!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (II)][Qingque]: Got it. Now I'm a real door guardian.

[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Notification sent. I guess now we should go to the Divination Commission and see what's going on?
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Mm, but let's talk to Cirrus again first.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: So, you imprisoned Luxie in the matrix... and I heard the cries of other heliobi longing to break free.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: It would seem the Ten-Lords Commission has everything under control... What is it you want from me?
[Percipient][Narration]: Same old same old.
[Percipient][Narration]: Just came to vent some anger.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Outside the confines of our agreement, you would be unwise to attack.
[Percipient][Narration]: We miss you.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: You have managed to disgust me still further...
[Percipient][Huohuo]: One victory equals one question... don't forget the agreement you made with the general.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Don't be so sure of victory before the battle begins, young one. Without Tail to protect you, isn't subduing a heliobus a bit overwhelming for you?
[Percipient][Cirrus]: You know, if you can accept me with an open heart... I can take his place and help you.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: ...R—Really?
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Of course.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: That's what I wanted to hear.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Oh?
[Percipient][Huohuo]: The fact that you're trying so hard to persuade me means that you're not sure of victory either.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: If you were, you'd have devoured us without hesitation. Am I right, Cirrus?
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Then have it your way — I'll destroy Jing Yuan's pawns here and now!
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Don't let your previous victory go to your heads...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: ...the slightest misstep will be your undoing!
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Let's see how you perform without the general here to watch your back...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: I will never rest...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Your mortal bodies will fatigue and breathe their last breath... and I will endure.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: We did it...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Ask your question.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: We think the The Divination Commission has been infiltrated by a heliobus, but we don't know which one.
[Percipient][Narration]: You tell Cirrus what's happening at the Divination Commission
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Entering the Xianzhou's window to the future... It must be none other than Keralum.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: They always relished hounding your prophets and seers with questions of destiny — watching them flounder between the random and the pre-ordained.
[Percipient][Narration]: Destiny... is pre-ordained.
[Percipient][Narration]: Destiny... is not pre-ordained.
[Percipient][Narration]: ...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Hahaha, that pile of protein in your human skull is computationally inefficient — your conjectures on destiny are little more than analogies and illusions...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: ...but we, The Shapeless, are different. When we come together to harmonize and observe, destiny is clear and vivid as firelight cast into darkness.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: In warfare, nothing is more important than being able to predict your opponent's movements. Among the fragments of Ignamar, Keralum was in charge of knowing the past and predicting the future.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: It is said that during that fateful battle, Keralum had a premonition of failure, but Ignamar ignored their warnings.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: It looks like we have a clear target this time. Let's get going.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: I may not have the same predictive power as Keralum, little fox girl... but one thing I do know is that sooner or later, you will beg for my help.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: ...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Time will tell!
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Lonely? Nothing to do? Shall I wake you up?
[Percipient][Cirrus]: If you have something to say then say it!
[Percipient][Narration]: What do you think about destiny?
[Percipient][Cirrus]: If you open your heart to me, I can take you to witness your destiny.
[Percipient][Narration]: Okay~
[Percipient][Cirrus]: ...Forget it. I don't like tasting the same dish twice — the same goes for possessions.
[Percipient][Narration]: Take a hike.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: You're the one who brought it up.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: If it's destiny you wish to discuss, I might as well tell you that I never think on it, or anything of the sort.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Everything in this world will come to an end. It could be a trillion years from now, or tomorrow afternoon. It could be as a result of Nanook's pawns, or a sigh from the Nihility, or something else entirely...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Eventually, this universe will be over, and all the species — long and short-life together — all of them will end up in the same place. It is inevitable.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: But does the knowledge of this fact change anything? What does it have to do with you?
[Percipient][Cirrus]: If you knew the Luofu were to perish tomorrow, would you skip dinner tonight? The flame of the heliobi will be extinguished in the hot silence of the universe... but that won't stop me from burning today...
[Percipient][Cirrus]: Destiny... why should a fish worry about where the river flows?
[Percipient][Narration]: Cirrus seems lost in thought, not answering anymore questions
[Percipient][Narration]: I just came by to look around.
[Percipient][Cirrus]: You should be paying me for the privilege.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Oh, you're here! Is that a Ten-Lords Commission judge?
[Percipient][Narration]: What's the situation inside?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Something's amiss in the Divination Commission — everyone is mumbling to themselves. Is this some workforce overhaul? Did I set a bad example?
[Percipient][Huohuo]: I—I'm afraid not, Miss Qingque. Something unexpected happened... I'm just not sure how to explain it...
[Percipient][Sushang]: The Divination Commission may have been infiltrated by some unknown creature... If you rush in, you could become a target too!
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Miss Sushang, we're supposed to be operating in secret!
[Percipient][Sushang]: I want Qingque to have an idea of the gravity of the situation.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Hmm... I suppose Miss Qingque should be safe enough — the one we're chasing probably has a more... complicated target...
[Percipient][Qingque]: That sounds like a compliment, but at the same time... Eh, I'll just take it as a compliment.
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Well... anyway, there's a dangerous situation at the Divination Commission at the moment, so just don't go in there!
[Percipient][Qingque]: Good idea, with working conditions like these, I wouldn't be able to concentrate anyway...
[Percipient][Qingque]: I heard from Awei that the Artisanship Commission is also experiencing strange phenomena — several of the apprentices have started babbling nonsensically, it's kinda scary... Of course, it could just be a side-effect of being denied graduation.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: In that case, Miss Qingque, could you stand guard here for us while we investigate?
[Percipient][Qingque]: It doesn't seem like a good idea to just stand here under such dangerous circumstances, does it?
[Percipient][Huohuo]: I mean, you could leave, but... Wait, are you thinking of coming with us? Didn't you see how bad the situation was...?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Yeah, yeah, I've seen it alright... but if I leave now, won't that count as unauthorized absence? I can get away with slacking off, but the Master Diviner won't tolerate complete abandonment of my post.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Besides, you guys need someone familiar with the Divination Commission to show you the way, right? Then let's go.
[Percipient][Qingque]: What's going on...
[Percipient][Huohuo]: , s—stay close to me, okay? I'm... I'm a little scared...
[Percipient][Sushang]: What are they looking at?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Is everyone... okay?
[Percipient][Divination Commission Diviner]: There is only one way...
[Percipient][Divination Commission Diviner]: Divination is meaningless...
[Percipient][Qingque]: How did the Matrix of Prescience become like this?
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Look, Diviner Fu is standing at the center of the Matrix of Prescience... what is she doing?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Judging by her chanting, I think she's performing navigation calculations, or divining...
[Percipient][Qingque]: But something's not right — the Matrix of Prescience isn't moving at all.
[Percipient][Narration]: She's probably already been possessed by a heliobus...
[Percipient][Qingque]: A heliobus... is that the danger you were talking about?
[Percipient][Qingque]: I read about them in a book. "Starfire Essence that can transform itself — enjoys manipulating the dreams and desires of mortals." You mean the Master Diviner is being controlled by something like that...?
[Percipient][Qingque]: How can we snap her out of it?
[Percipient][Huohuo]: We could try ringing the Harmonic Chime... If we're close enough, we should be able to enter the heliobus's illusion.
[Percipient][Narration]: Shake Harmonic Chime
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Silence! Idle chatter is not permitted in the Divination Commission!
[Percipient][Qingque]: Master Diviner, you're awake!
[Percipient][Huohuo]: ...Or perhaps we should call you Keralum?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: It doesn't matter what you call me — I am the master of the Divination Commission.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: The current divination has reached a delicate stage, and no one is permitted to disturb it — not even a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission or a guest from the Astral Express!
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Qingque! I have grown weary of your insubordination! Are you the one who brought these outsiders into the Commission? Have you turned a deaf ear to all the rules I've laid down?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Qingque, you are hereby expelled from the Commission!
[Percipient][Qingque]: I...? Th—That's...
[Percipient][Sushang]: Darn... Now we're down one person!
[Percipient][Qingque]: ...a great idea!
[Percipient][Qingque]: Eh-he, my days here really have been unproductive — loafing around outside and playing Celestial Jade — all while taking a Divination Commission salary. It's... how to put it...
[Percipient][Narration]: Compensation without labor?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Not exactly, I do complete all my assigned work on time...
[Percipient][Narration]: Living high on public expense?
[Percipient][Sushang]: That's not quite the right way to describe it...
[Percipient][Narration]: Too much of a good thing?
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Sure sounds like it. I could only dream of having a cozy job like that.
[Percipient][Qingque]: I would call it: wasting my life away. Thank you, Master Diviner, for giving me the push I needed. Since you feel that my skills could be put to better use elsewhere, it's time for me to think about making some changes.
[Percipient][Qingque]: But before I leave, I have to help these guests take care of some trouble here at the Commission. If I don't, people will think I was fired because of cowardice in the face of danger.
[Percipient][Qingque]: What next? What do we do now?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Hehe, giving a dramatic speech to my boss was cool and everything, but it's not gonna help her break free from the heliobus clouding her mind.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: I'm not sure what to do... The heliobus isn't trying to trap us inside the illusion, and it doesn't look interested in attacking us either...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: "Clouding my mind"? I've never been of clearer mind than I am right now.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: From now on, I will dedicate myself to divining the predetermined futures of the Xianzhou Alliance, and will make these futures known to the world so that all can live in clarity.
[Percipient][Narration]: I think you've gone off the deep end...
[Percipient][Narration]: ...How is it possible to divine every future?
[Percipient][Narration]: Since when is the future predetermined?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: I know what you want to say. Spare me the lecture on "human wisdom prevailing over nature" and those ridiculous notions of "free will..." These are but crude illusions created by the brain. From the beginning, there was only one path.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: You, , you are nothing more than a pawn at the mercy of the Stellaron Hunters.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: What day you boarded the Express, who your enemies are, where you go... These choices that you think you make freely of your own accord are mere tributaries... that will eventually converge on the path of destiny.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Your journey to the Xianzhou, the defeat of Phantylia — all these were written into a script long ago by that slave to destiny, hidden in the shadows.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Even in this very moment, your options are few: Ready your bat and charge at me, argue with me loudly and futilely, or fall into silence.
[Percipient][Qingque]: , don't let her words get to you! There are always other options!
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: The rise and fall of the tides are dictated by the fire trigram and the water trigram — you are powerless against such a force. You have no hope of defeating me.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Venting your anger is meaningless.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Anger cannot change that which is already ordained by destiny.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: All offense, no defense. Is that your strategy?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Your attacks won't land on me — only on these innocent puppets.
[Percipient][Narration]: Fu Xuan seems disappointed
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Come back to me when you've thought it through.
[Percipient][Narration]: Fu Xuan seems disappointed
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Come back to me when you've thought it through.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Such trivial choices cannot change the inevitable.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: If you're still not convinced, I can demonstrate to you the true nature of destiny — in a way that your human brain can comprehend.
[Percipient][Narration]: Okay, sounds good to me.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Then follow me.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: If you have gained clarity on the true nature of destiny, you may leave... and stop interfering with my divinations!
[Percipient][Huohuo]: What is this...?
[Percipient][Qingque]: This place is what the Divination Commission calls the "Pathfinder." It's a sandbox game that diviners use to simulate future paths and exercise our minds. But why did the Master Diviner bring us here?
[Percipient][Narration]: You want to play a game with us?
[Percipient][Narration]: Is this where you show us the true nature of destiny?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: That's right. Now listen, . If you place an ingenium in this little maze and give it a command, it will find its way to the exit precisely as it was commanded to do so. Are humans not the same as they navigate the path of destiny set before them?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: But you're probably thinking: "humans are not machines, there is more than one path in the universe!"
[Percipient][Narration]: Humans are not machines.
[Percipient][Narration]: There is more than one path in the universe!
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: And yet machines we are — complex, sophisticated, but machines.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: We are just like the ingenium in this maze — we have no options to speak of... We can only navigate one path — the one that takes us to our destination.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Let's begin. Lead the ingenium to the exit. Show me how many choices destiny gives you.
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: It feels like we're just dancing to the heliobus's tune...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Let's begin. Lead the ingenium to the exit. Show me how many choices destiny gives you.
[Percipient][Narration]: Alright, make sure you're paying attention.
[Percipient][Qingque]: We did it!
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Well done. Your choices are as the omniscia foresaw them. You should know that there was only one answer to this puzzle from the beginning, just as destiny has only one path!
[Percipient][Narration]: It's just a game.
[Percipient][Narration]: This puzzle was designed by you.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Yes, for a puzzle that was designed from the start, choosing any other path would be a pointless mistake.
[Percipient][Qingque]: But the universe isn't someone's game, and no one is designing puzzles for us to solve. The universe doesn't have a single answer... we can do anything we want while we're in it.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Even if it's the same work every day, I can hide in the library and read a book or find someone to play Celestial Jade with... and that's freedom.
[Percipient][Sushang]: I never thought slacking off could convince me of anything... the sign of a true scholar! A diviner of the Divination Commission after all!
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Sushang, snap out of it! A slacker heliobus is getting into your head!
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Qingque, Qingque... For you, life may have a seemingly infinite number of choices. That is because your choices are simply different ways of slacking off and wasting time — they are of no consequence to anything... but for me, choices come with very real consequences.
[Percipient][Qingque]: That's the most "divinery" thing you've said so far...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: As the Master Diviner of the Luofu, I have a heavy responsibility. I must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Some paths look promising, but lead to an abyss of despair. Then there are small trails that plunge deep into unimaginable darkness. And in the end...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: ...I realized that we have no real choices. There is only one path to follow, only one way to the optimal solution, even if it is paved with ashes and bitterness.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: There is only one way — and there only ever was.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: What do we do... I don't think we can persuade her...
[Percipient][Qingque]: I have a proposal — why don't we try a more advanced sandbox?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: However long you want to play this game, and whatever tricks you try to pull, I'll happily play along.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: ...Miss Qingque?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Use your "free will" to guide the ingenium out of the sandbox.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Let's begin. Lead the ingenium to the exit. Show me how many choices destiny gives you.
[Percipient][Narration]: Alright, make sure you're paying attention.
[Percipient][Qingque]: The path changed slightly, but it was just as simple. I'm sure the Master Diviner would say—
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Destiny only has one path. Your choices are just a predetermined solution to the puzzle.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Actually, I don't think I agree. Master Diviner, let's reset the sandbox and give it another go, shall we?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Again? Do it all over again, exactly as it was? You can try it a million times over, and a million times over it is doomed to the same fate — because there is only one path.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Hehe, I see what you're thinking, Qingque... you're an interesting one.
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Qingque, I've been thinking through the calculations for this puzzle — there really is only one solution.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: This maze was designed by Keralum. It's no use — there aren't any other solutions. As long as we're playing this so-called game of destiny, we can't win.
[Percipient][Qingque]: No, there's a second choice. There will always be another choice.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: , quick, say something to persuade her...
[Percipient][Narration]: I see where she's going with this...
[Percipient][Narration]: I have no clue what she's thinking...
[Percipient][Narration]: It's all yours, Qingque.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: I didn't mean like that...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Ready to begin?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Of course there's another solution to this sandbox. , listen to my idea.
[Percipient][Qingque]: You're all gonna help, right?
[Percipient][Narration]: Of course.
[Percipient][Narration]: There is more than one path...
[Percipient][Qingque]: Correct.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Miss Qingque, I don't know how you're planning to solve the puzzle... but I'll support this squad to the end...
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Count me in. I'm sure Miss Qingque has something up her sleeve.
[Percipient][Sushang]: If we can help, I'm in.
[Percipient][Qingque]: I only need two people for my plan to work.
[Percipient][Qingque]: , you go stand in the sandbox... right about that spot over there.
[Percipient][Narration]: Stay put
[Percipient][Qingque]: Next, Judge Huohuo, you stand on the other side — and stop shaking!
[Percipient][Narration]: Stay put
[Percipient][Qingque]: All right, we're ready.
[Percipient][Qingque]: And now the second path appears.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Let's begin. Lead the ingenium to the exit. Show me how many choices destiny gives you.
[Percipient][Narration]: Alright, make sure you're paying attention.
[Percipient][Qingque]: This is the other solution — the alternative choice. I created a new solution.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Master Diviner, you're not the only one who can design a puzzle, and I don't tread the path of destiny alone.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: ...Hahahaha... you think that by calling on your companions for help, you created a new path out of thin air?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: You're just playing with semantics. I could weave a thousand routes for you, but they lead to the same destination — so what significance is there in having a choice?
[Percipient][Narration]: You don't even understand what Qingque is saying.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Creatures like you don't understand humans.
[Percipient][Qingque]: The universe is like jade tiles on a game table. When the tiles are shuffled, the outcome is already predetermined.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Which tiles can be played, which tiles are leftover, what kind of hand the person next to you is trying to make — all of these can be determined through calculations. But if everything is just a calculation, the game loses its flavor.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Randomness and adaptability, ambushing your opponent, twists and turns, the balance of the elements — it's a mix of calculations, unknowns, and loss of complete control that makes Celestial Jade the kind of game it is — and those are the same things that give life its color and vibrance.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Do my "choices" at the game table mean nothing if I have a sure loss in front of me? No — the choices are what make the game meaningful in the first place.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Even if I lose, I'll still make choices to lighten the loss — just like Master Diviner is making choices for her own agenda.
[Percipient][Qingque]: You were right when you said that as Master Diviner, you must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
[Percipient][Qingque]: In this vast universe — a game where there are only losers — our Master Diviner is making endless choices, fighting against the odds just so the Luofu can safely travel for another day. Hehe, in my book she's the best player there is.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Why would someone as talented as the Master Diviner go through the trouble of making endless choices if the end result is predetermined?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Heliobus, you cannot fathom the joys of humanity. You are imprisoned by the illusion of destiny, unable to free yourself, and you want everyone who peeks into the future to suffer the same pain as you.
[Percipient][Qingque]: You... You don't understand humans at all.
[Percipient][Keralum]: Aghhhhh! Don't let them trick you, Fu Xuan! Don't push me away! Don't let her words fool you!
[Percipient][Narration]: Fu Xuan is breaking free from their grasp!
[Percipient][Narration]: Now!
[Percipient][Qingque]: Keralum, release the Master Diviner!
[Percipient][Keralum]: I see through your trickery! I see through every bit of it!
[Percipient][Keralum]: I'm going to lose! Victory is beyond my reach!
[Percipient][Keralum]: Why... why is there no alternative?
[Percipient][Keralum]: Everything in this universe is predetermined!
[Percipient][Keralum]: No, I... I had no path to victory...
[Percipient][Qingque]: Master Diviner! A—Are you alright?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: I... I'm fine. Just a small headache, nothing more.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: It's normal to experience some discomfort after being possessed by a heliobus, but nothing a few medicinal pellets can't take care of.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Is that... Keralum? Hmph, they may not be the most powerful fragment, but becoming entangled in their illusion can lead to endless despair.
[Percipient][Keralum]: Hurry... just hurry up and... seal me in the darkness...
[Percipient][Keralum]: I've foreseen what happens next... you're going to imprison me...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Qingque, thanks to you, the Divination Commission is safe again.
[Percipient][Qingque]: No need to thank me, Master Diviner. By the way, while you were possessed, you fired me from the Commission, so... that counts, right? I'll have to ask you to give me written notice that my contract has been unilaterally terminated.
[Percipient][Qingque]: Then, with all the years I've spent in the Divination Commission, I'll be able to get a great severance package...
[Percipient][Qingque]: ...and I already planned what to do with all the money — I'm gonna open a gaming parlor, hire a couple of workers to run it, and spend the rest of my days living off the profits. I'll have started a new life without having lifted a finger, hehe.
[Percipient][Sushang]: Are there two Qingques?
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: I see... What a pity, I don't recall anything I may or may not have said while possessed by the heliobus.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: In any case, Qingque, why are you still here? Shouldn't you be on duty back at the repository?
[Percipient][Qingque]: Huh!? M—Master Diviner, you can't back out now!
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Of course I can. After all, there are always choices in life. You taught me that.
[Percipient][Qingque]: I can't convince real you, let alone possessed you... Master Diviner, you should get some rest. I'm gonna go take a br— uh, I mean... get back to work...
[Percipient][Narration]: Fu Xuan brings herself to inspect the commission, and order is soon restored.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: My actions today brought great shame on the Divination Commission...
[Percipient][Narration]: At least no one else got hurt.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Yes, all is well, minus my headache...
[Percipient][Narration]: Don't worry, Qingque's the only witness in the Commission.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Hmm, I shall have to think of a way to keep her from talking... Hehe, just kidding.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Heliobi are good at finding people's weaknesses and exploiting them... Everyone has some kind of weakness — you're not to blame.
[Percipient][Sushang]: That's right — you were just a victim of the heliobus's trickery, Diviner Fu — no need to blame yourself.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: I must express my sincere gratitude to all of you for your help.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Apologies, but the Divination Commission is in disarray at the moment. I must return and set things in order — I'm afraid I cannot see you off in person.
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Wait! There's something we need to ask you.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: What is it?
[Percipient][Narration]: You tell Fu Xuan the details of your operation
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: Mm, I agree that "Master Diviner Gets Possessed" wouldn't make for a good headline...
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: I don't care how you spin the story, so long as you leave my name and identity out of it.
[Percipient][Fu Xuan]: I have many things to attend to — please allow me to save my thanks for another day.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: We won't delay you any longer. We need to go to Fyxestroll Garden and seal Keralum away.
[Percipient][Narration]: Expel evil and capture stray spirits... With the support of the Ten Lords Commission's spiritfarers, you seal the heliobi within the Lunaumbra Gourd.
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: It seems that your operations have met with some success.
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: I've been browsing through some of the stories on Ghostly Grove myself — they make for good reading.
[Percipient][Narration]: Did you hear about the Master Diviner?
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: As the saying goes, serious divination concerns serious matters. It is inevitable that someone performing divination day in and day out for the Xianzhou would acquire inner demons, and heliobus can take advantage of those. Fortunately, with your help, Fu Xuan prevailed over her intruder.
[Percipient][Narration]: What do you think about destiny?
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: Do you enjoy listening to storytellers and watching immersia?
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: In both cases, tales have a predetermined ending — but you shouldn't let that stop you from enjoying them, should you?
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: The same is true of life. Whether the end is predestined or not, it's worth living.
[Percipient][Narration]: I'm heading off.
[Percipient][Jing Yuan]: Very well, then. Miss Hanya is waiting for you by the suppression towers.
[Percipient][Hanya]: On behalf of the Ten-Lords Commission, I commend you for your great service in resolving the Divination Commission crisis. I will honor all of you before the Ten Lords.
[Percipient][Huohuo]: Thanks, Madam Hanya...
[Percipient][Huohuo]: ...but we really couldn't have defeated Keralum without Miss Qingque's help.
[Percipient][Hanya]: I didn't realize that one as skilled as Diviner Fu would also be susceptible to the power of the heliobi.
[Percipient][Hanya]: That said... I can understand her plight. After all, we are all moving forward on our own unseen paths... in no uncertain terms.
[Percipient][Hanya]: Judges are instructed by the Ten Lords to carry out their orders, but no one ever explains their meaning to us...
[Percipient][Hanya]: Just like the master diviner — no matter what cruel and horrible paths she foresaw, as long as it benefited the Luofu, she had to make a choice.
[Percipient][Hanya]: Those choices may be correct and far-sighted, but we are, after all, flesh and blood, and we cannot help but agonize over the process of making them.
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Madam Hanya
[Percipient][Hanya]: I apologize, I was getting carried away. I think all the paperwork must have worn down my mental acuity. Today's business is finished. Please get some good rest!
[Percipient][Guinaifen]: Right! Let's call it a day. And you too, Judge Hanya — don't work yourself to death.
[Percipient][Sushang]: It's finally time to get back to bed. Goodbye, everyone.
[Percipient][Narration]: I'm totally beat, too. Chat more in the group later.
[Percipient][Narration]: Remember to share the account updates.
[Percipient][Hanya]: My apologies for rambling on just now...
[Percipient][Hanya]: Today's work is finished! Please make sure to get some rest!

[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: I don't think searching like this is the best way...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: "Diner haunted! Evil spirit breaks into restaurant and eats double its body weight in food!" ...Do you think Tail did this? Seems like his style...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: Sounds like a very hungry criminal came up with a very poor excuse...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: What about this one... "Paranormal activity reported at exclusive horror immersia! Guests experience haunting within seven days of screening!"
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: It reminds me of when I used to watch horror immersia to train my courage... whenever there was a suspenseful moment, Tail would jump up and scare me.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: Guys, I feel like this is just some sort of prank... or a marketing stunt to boost ticket sales.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Narration]: What are you guys up to?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Narration]: Have we planned out our next steps yet?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: Huohuo has been browsing Ghostly Grove for hours. Every time she finds a suspicious incident, she says: "Do you think Tail did this?"
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: The problem is, any suspicious incident could be Tail-related when you think about it...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: I feel like Tail is still around... but if so, why didn't he come back to see me?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Narration]: He'll come back.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: He was your tail for so many years, I'm sure he'd come back to say hi... or bye.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Narration]: Well, he is a heliobus.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: That's right — we can't really know what a heliobus is thinking, right? Tail was sealed away for ages and then suddenly let free... If it were me, I'd want some away time.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: You'll just have to be a little patient.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: Anyway, even if you don't find Tail, you're still a great judge — the success of our ghost-hunting squad proves it.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: I... Thank you, Miss Gui. I... I don't really get compliments. Without the encouragement of you squad members...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: Ahem. Working with you guys has made me feel a little more confident... but it's hard not to think about the days when Tail was still around...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: Back then I was a useless coward — I'd hide at the first sign of trouble. Tail would always complain about it... but he'd also get me out of danger.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: Reminds me of me and my brother — sort of a love-hate relationship.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: Hey! Look at this!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: Did you find Tail?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: Hey! Look at this!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: Is this... something Tail would do?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: Tail or no Tail — it's definitely the work of a heliobus!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Sushang]: Let's hurry up and get to the scene — there'll be trouble to pay if we're too late.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Narration]: Let's go.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Narration]: Shouldn't we talk to Cirrus first?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Guinaifen]: We don't have time for that. Even if Cirrus does know something, by the time we've finished asking questions, it'll be too late!
[Fyxestroll Gathering (III)][Huohuo]: Be careful everyone — this sounds like a very aggressive heliobus.

[Sword Essence][Vigilant Cloud Knight]: Hey, calm down!
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: I just learned a new technique — I'll use it to end your life!
[Sword Essence][Narration]: What's with this guy?
[Sword Essence][Vigilant Cloud Knight]: Unauthorized personnel should keep their distance — it's dangerous here!
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Actually, we're... not really unauthorized, are we, Judge?
[Sword Essence][Vigilant Cloud Knight]: Is that... Sushang? And a judge... Why are the Ten-Lords Commission here?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: It's a very long story, so let's deal with the problem at hand first.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Mr. Cloud Knight sir, the Ten-Lords Commission will handle this. Thank you for your cooperation.
[Sword Essence][Vigilant Cloud Knight]: Understood... Please, take mercy on him.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Don't worry, this sort of thing is our specialty.
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: See how you like this!
[Sword Essence][Narration]: After a struggle, you subdue the crazed Cloud Knight.
[Sword Essence][Vigilant Cloud Knight]: Judge Huohuo, is he... alright?
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: His life isn't in danger, but his hands and feet are spasming... and his speech is incoherent. I think he's experiencing a delusion that he can't snap out of.
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: I feel... like I've been drained of my strength...
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Mr. Cloud Knight sir, are you okay? Can you answer a few questions for me? Do you remember what happened to you?
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: I... I think so... Let me think for a moment...
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: I received a report today about an infestation of abominations here at the Alchemy Commission — the captain sent me to clear it out. What happened after that was like a dream... I can't explain it.
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: My weapon suddenly started talking to me... it taught me fighting techniques — which moves to avoid, which moves to use, which stances to adopt to retain balance... then it told me to relax and let it take control against the enemy.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: That sounds just like... a heliobus!
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: I followed its instructions... To my surprise, it felt like my combat skills had greatly improved. Still, it told me I was incompetent, like a piece of rotten wood. It wanted to find a new apprentice to carry forward the art.
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: It was only then that I realized — there was a sword-wielding child beside me, staring right at me.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: A child?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: A sword-wielding child?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Your weapon wanted to take the child as your apprentice?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Lots of children grow up learning to use a sword on the Luofu, but for a child to be walking around with one...
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: ...I sure hope we're not thinking of the same person.
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: I realized the boy was the General's retainer, Yanqing.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: I knew it...
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: When I heard my sword say the name, I was in disbelief... and then, for some reason, I just... attacked Yanqing.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Was Yanqing alright?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Are YOU alright? You should be asking the Cloud Knight.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Are you okay?
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: Yes, I'm fine. The funny thing is that I didn't even see him move — I just fell straight to the ground.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Seems like you both came out unscathed...
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: He must have spared me. The funny thing is that I didn't even see him move — I just fell straight to the ground.
[Sword Essence][Delirious Cloud Knight]: What happened next was even more outlandish — Yanqing looked like he was talking to the sword in his hand. He turned around and left without looking back. And my weapon... my weapon never spoke again.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Not good!
[Sword Essence][Vigilant Cloud Knight]: I'll take care of the Cloud Knight. You go after Yanqing!
[Sword Essence][Narration]: A blue sword swishes by.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Upon detecting your presence, it approaches and starts flying in circles around you.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: It that a new cycrane model!?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: It's Yanqing's sword — I saw him wield it one time when I was doing drills with the Cloud Knights.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: It seems to be calling us...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: I heard that Yanqing's sword is a famous weapon crafted by the Artisanship Commission. It resonates with its master — reacting to his movements in battle like it has a mind of its own.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: He must have encountered some kind of danger... and his sword flew away to find someone to help, right?
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: D—Danger...? Miss Sushang, don't scare me like that — what kind of evil would be strong enough to pose a threat to Yanqing?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: I'm not sure, but the heliobi are strange creatures — even the sharpest sword can't cut them.
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Uh-oh. I just had a thought...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: If it's not auspicious, you'd best not say it out loud!
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Based on what that Cloud knight [sic] said, it isn't that Yanqing's in danger...
[Sword Essence][Narration]: It's that we're in danger?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: It's that Yanqing has become the danger?
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Exactly.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Follow the sword. No matter what, we have to find Yanqing before things get even worse.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Investigate
[Sword Essence][Narration]: The body of an abomination, with only a single sword cut on it.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: We've got to catch up with him before things get out of hand.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: The waves ride on the howling wind, bashing the ford with great intensity.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Yanqing's sword hangs in the air, pointing to the distance across the Lunarescent Depths.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: This is the dock for Dragonprayer Terrace. Judging by the sword's behaviour... that's where Yanqing is [sic]
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Should we really be charging over there? Even without a heliobus, Yanqing is a swordsmaster among swordsmasters.
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: A—Are you scared, Sushang? Me too... Compared to the other heliobi we've dealt with so far, this one seems like it could do some serious damage.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Scared? Hmph! My mother taught me swordplay as soon as I could walk. I might not be as good as the general's apprentice, but I would never let cowardice dishonor the name of the Cloud Knights or the family sword...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: ...but I am worried... If the heliobus possessing Yanqing is too strong, I'm afraid I might not be able to guarantee everyone's safety.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: The General has been supporting our ghost-hunting squad from the very beginning — it's time to return the favor.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Even if it wasn't for the general's sake, as a judge, I can't let a heliobus take over someone as dangerous as Yanqing.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Sushang, Miss Gui, , please help me rescue him.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Yanqing is at Dragonprayer Terrace. , let's go.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Let's catch a ferry and head for Dragonprayer Terrace.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Let me get ready first...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: What are all these swords doing in Dragonprayer Terrace...?
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: It must be a heliobus illusion...
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Shouldn't we ring the Harmonic Chime and see if we can talk to Yanqing inside the illusion?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Illusion?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Since each of you can see it, wouldn't that mean you'd fallen into the illusion as well?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Don't be alarmed. To me, these swords form a precious arsenal. When I gaze upon any one, a thousand sword fights dance before my eyes — the swordplay far exceeding anything I have learned.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: And better yet, they welcome those who wish to pursue higher realms with open arms.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: A heliobus is leading you astray.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: I know that this is an illusion created by a heliobus. The General sent me to assist the Ten-Lords Commission — I know a thing or two about your work...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: These cosmic flames are not good nor evil, they are simply a mirror... As long as a host's mind is clear, a heliobus cannot control them.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Take me, for example... At this moment, I am free of all distractions... and I see the potential for greatness in these swords. Isn't that right, Master Apyra?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: I'm not interested in swordsmanship.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Swordsmanship isn't the only thing you can learn. As long as you want to become stronger, these swords will show you countless ways to do so. Isn't that right, Master Apyra?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: The general sent us to bring you back...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: The General? You lie. I've already finished my assignment at the Alchemy Commission. I have no further orders...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: This is my own time. I came here to learn from Master Apyra... to learn from these swords.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Apyra? That heliobus's name is Apyra?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Correct. Master Apyra promised to show me the flaws in my swordplay, and how to take it to the next level. That's why I brought them to Dragonprayer Terrace... where I suffered my most serious setback...
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Young one, with me, everything will be different.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Whether it be Imbibitor Lunae, the Stellaron Hunters, or that woman, your accomplishments will exceed them. You will be matchless, without limits.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Matchless, without limits...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: You're just in time. The swords have taught me something already... I'd like to see how sharp my skills have become...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: My skills are lacking... I've been through countless defeats...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: ...but with Apyra as my master — no longer!
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Why is he attacking us!?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: A swordfight must be fought with sincerity of heart and mind... Give it your all!
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Lieutenant Yanqing, snap out of it! We don't want to fight you!
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: But I want to fight you... and we're just getting started!
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Their skills are nothing compared to mine... what can I learn from any of them...
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Then why not hack them down right here?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Hack... them down? I thought we were just sparring.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: The laws of the battlefield are no different from the laws of the universe — life for victory and death for defeat. Swordsmanship is the art of victory, and only the victorious swords can be passed on — swords defeated are buried among the barren wastelands.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: But...
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: You're resisting me? Tsk, rid yourself of these needless notions of clemency. How can you move forward without casting these distractions aside! Raise your sword!
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Hmph, "life for victory and death for defeat," huh? All this talk of laws of the battlefield and the universe — you think that gives the appearance of a grand master? You're just using someone else's ambition to satisfy your own desire to shed blood.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: This Xuanyuan Sword in my hand has been passed down through my family for generations. When my mother gave it to me, she said: "The bread may bake, but the hearth remains..." and for a long time I had no idea what she was talking about.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Today I just realized I misheard her. I think she actually said: "The edge may break, but the heart remains..." probably.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Lieutenant Yanqing, the winner and loser of this battle have yet to be determined. Don't give me that "there's no point in fighting any longer" speech!
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Hahaha, this little wench's fighting spirit is on fire! Young one, since she insists on fighting, will you give her our answer?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: I... I won't back down.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Miss Sushang, you—
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: This is between fellow Cloud Knights. Losing a fight isn't a big deal, but if I abandon my fellow soldiers and bring dishonor to the Knights, how could I wield my sword again?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Granted, I might not last more than a few moves. You guys go get the general — quickly! I'll try and hold him off until he gets here!
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Sushang, my bestie... why is she so stubborn...?
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Still, that was pretty freaking cool...
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: A spiritfarer told me that the General is still in Fyxestroll Garden — let's hurry!
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: I think the only one that can break Yanqing's illusion is Jing Yuan himself...
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: , is something the matter? You seem out of breath.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: You tell Jing Yuan what happened on Dragonprayer Terrace
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: A heliobus that creates illusions for the sole purpose of instructing someone in swordplay? I wouldn't mind learning a few tricks from them myself... Unfortunately, it sounds like this one is a little too aggressive to be a decent sparring partner. This is not an adversary that someone as young as Yanqing is equipped to deal with.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: General, we need to move fast — if we wait any longer, I'm afraid that Sushang might be—
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: I can understand your sense of urgency. But before I leave, I have a question for Cirrus, who has been listening this whole time — I trust you are familiar with Apyra...
[Sword Essence][Cirrus]: Naturally. Among the heliobi, Apyra manifests the courage and warring spirit of Ignamar — they are the most aggressive of all the fragments... but who is this swordmaster? Who is Yanqing?
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: My apprentice.
[Sword Essence][Cirrus]: Hee-hee, no wonder I smell a hint of sadness in you... In order to rescue his incompetent apprentice, the master must fight on the battlefield himself? I must say, I'm very envious of Apyra...
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: You know the flavor of sadness, but not its meaning. An apprentice obsessed with victory and defeat has lost his mind to a heliobus, and is now trying to shortcut his way to mastery of the sword. This is my failure to him as a master, and the source of the grief you see in me now.
[Sword Essence][Cirrus]: Then you should hurry — Apyra has an insatiable bloodlust. Once they've enslaved your mind, they can make you turn against your friends, your kin... even your own master.
[Sword Essence][Cirrus]: Go. I don't wish to delay your deathmatch with your apprentice.
[Sword Essence][Cirrus]: Come to laugh at me again, have you, little brat?
[Sword Essence][Cirrus]: I'm not in the mood for your chatter — go away!
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: Sushang is awaiting our timely arrival at Dragonprayer Terrace. , let's go.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Dragonprayer Terrace it is...
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Let me get ready first...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Lieutenant of the Seat of Divine Foresight... Is that the best you can do? And I was thinking I'd be done for the moment you drew your sword.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: I didn't think... I didn't think I would last this long. I... I'm not half as bad as I thought.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Young one, you're hesitating again. You're always hesitating...
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Your opponent is no match for you, yet they have managed to fend you off for this long. As a swordsman, have you not any pride? Do you want to repeat the disaster you suffered at Dragonprayer Terrace?
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: It's time to finish it. Only blood can cleanse the shame of the sword.
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: He won't do it.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: General...
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Young one, your old teacher has arrived.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Under his tutelage, you never experienced true failure. But after suffering your first major setback, your confidence in your swordsmanship has been faltering.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: You worry that the General is disappointed in you. You worry that you don't have what it takes to be the person the General wants you to be.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Now... show him what I have taught you. He'll be very proud of your progress. Tell him that with your sword, you will bring victory to the Xianzhou!
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: With... With my sword...
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing would never draw his sword on me to prove himself. I have confidence in him.
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: This confidence is not a belief that he will win every contest... It is a belief that he will one day break free from the paradigm of victory and defeat and realize his true reason for wielding the sword... The pleasure of swordsmanship, the saving of life, and the dispatchment of enemies...
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: This truth must be discovered by himself — no one can teach it to him. Now is the time for him to take that step.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: General... I...
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Break free from victory and defeat? Those are just empty words to comfort the dead and the defeated! Think of your crushing defeat at Dragonprayer Terrace! Think of how you felt then — teetering on the brink of death.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: If the sword of that Stellaron Hunter had pierced your flesh, you wouldn't be standing here pondering the meaning of victory and defeat.
[Sword Essence][Voice From the Sword Formation]: Now is the time to break all your chains. Draw your sword on your master — to the general who is trying to imprison you... draw your sword!
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: General... allow me... to demonstrate my swordsmanship. I hereby challenge you...
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Apyra! I challenge you! I challenge these swords, to battle!
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: ...Young fool, how disappointing. Your accomplishments would have been limitless... but you were led astray by empty idealism.
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: None of that matters anymore. While teaching you, I studied your every move inside out...
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: ...and now you wish to throw down the gauntlet. Very well. In your own image and with your own techniques, I will teach you one final lesson!
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: Your swordplay, every stroke and sway — I've committed it all to memory.
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: Now, allow me to demonstrate...
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: ...with merciless intent, how powerful I am.
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: No, Yanqing.
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: Conceal your form and hide your intentions, don't fall for their distractions.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Understood!
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: One hit, one stroke of luck, one victory.
[Sword Essence][Apyra]: Impressive... I am bested...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Phew. It's about time we got this guy into the gourd.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: General...
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: I know what you wish to say Yanqing. We can move past the melodrama.
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Then... to the rest of you, thank you — for briging [sic] me out of that daze... Especially you, Miss Sushang.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Why does everyone that gets "heliobused" love to apologize for it? You're the victim here. They're the ones stirring up chaos.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: It should be me thanking you for holding back during our battle...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Or maybe, just maybe, it's due to a sudden skill improvement? Don't you think?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: When you're not passed out in fear, you're pretty good.
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Haha, right — conscious Sushang is pretty badass.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: A little pleased with yourself, aren't you...?
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: She went toe-to-toe with the general's star pupil! I'd be pretty pleased with myself, too.
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: We're gonna need to get you a front page news story for this one. Heck, let's get some billboards!
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: So you've made it your daily mission to tease me, huh?
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: With respect to this incident, what is your plan for posting on the Luofu's Ghostly Grove? Since it concerns the Seat of Divine Foresight, I am hoping you could...
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Well, about that... let me discuss it with  first.
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: ...Is everyone okay with this?
[Sword Essence][Yanqing]: Thanks for covering for me... I'm so embarrassed.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: All's well that ends well. We should hurry back and lock Apyra in the Evil Binding Matrix... They're a dangerous one — I'm afraid they might escape!
[Sword Essence][Jing Yuan]: Well then, Yanqing and I will take our leave now.
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Alright, let's get out of here!
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Expel evil and capture stray spirits... With the support of the Ten Lords Commission's spiritfarers, you seal the heliobi within the Lunaumbra Gourd.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: Phew, th—that was a big risk, Miss Sushang...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Actually, I'm well aware of my own limits. If it weren't for Yanqing resisting that heliobus, maybe I wouldn't have been able to hold on until you brought reinforcements.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: ...Why did it take three people to get reinforcements?
[Sword Essence][Narration]: ...Was it crucial for ALL of us to retreat?
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Come to think of it... we only needed one person to fetch reinforcements... Why didn't we get  to stay behind with you...? And why didn't you ask!?
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: ...Hehe, it's kinda embarassing but... I was caught up in the moment — I guess I never thought it through...
[Sword Essence][Guinaifen]: Sometimes I wonder whether your head's screwed on right. We need to take you to the Alchemy Commission for a check-up.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Maybe, but my actions kept everyone safe, and that's what matters! Miss Huohuo needed someone to look out for her, and Little Gui is just a civilian — you shouldn't be putting yourself in risky situations. As for ,  a distinguished guest of the Seat of Divine Foresight — if anything were to happen to , it could turn into a diplomatic crisis.
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: After weighing things up in my head, it made the most sense for only me to stay put.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: I—If I still had my tail... I wouldn't be slowing everyone down...
[Sword Essence][Sushang]: Sorry Huohuo, I didn't think it through. You were never a burden.
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: It's not your fault Miss Sushang, it's just... I've been wondering — how can someone average like me keep up with the affairs of the Ten-Lords Commission without my tail?
[Sword Essence][Huohuo]: ...Forget it. We should get some rest — there could be even bigger dangers waiting for us tomorrow.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: You can always find Tail. Don't worry too much about it.
[Sword Essence][Narration]: Let's sync up the rest of the intel in the group chat...

[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Guinaifen]: I'm looking at the reply — see, here. Miss Hanya said she's on her way.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: It appears we are all present. The spiritfarers who were supposed to report to Huohuo mentioned they didn't see her today.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: I'll get straight to the point — I have no idea where Huohuo may be. However, if we combine our efforts we may be able to piece together some clues. Each of you are close to Huohuo, did you notice anything unusual about her yesterday?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Narration]: She was concerned about her Tail.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Guinaifen]: Yeah, Miss Huohuo has been trying to track down Tail — in addition to helping the squad, that is.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Narration]: It seems like there's something weighing on her mind lately.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Guinaifen]: She's been down in the dumps ever since she lost Tail.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Narration]: She thinks she's slowing us down.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: Since becoming a judge, Huohuo has often thought about resigning. She thinks she might not be cut out for the task.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: If you ask me, after she lost Tail, I think her urge to resign became even more apparent.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Guinaifen]: What if Huohuo came across a lead today — something that sounded like Tail's doing...? Knowing her, she's probably gone looking for him...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: ...And yet she didn't come to any of us for help. That's not like her.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: Given the type of person she is, if she did have any clues, she would seek out our help. If she hasn't shared anything with us, it means there is only one possibility.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Narration]: She's been deceived?
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Guinaifen]: Correct. And I think I might know who the culprit is.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Narration]: Perhaps she doesn't trust us.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: After working together for the last few days, it is clear that Huohuo has already formed a close bond with each of you. It is hard for me to imagine she would simply wander off on her own... Unless someone deceived her...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Narration]: She must have some reason for acting alone...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Sushang]: Right, maybe someone deceived her with news about Tail — told her "she could only go alone." Sounds like a trick some nasty kidnapper would use.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: Cirrus... The only one who may have knowledge of Tail's whereabouts is Cirrus... whose plans were foiled due to Tail's actions.
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Guinaifen]: Even if Cirrus doesn't know where Tail is, given the shared history, they wouldn't hesitate to cause trouble...
[Fyxestroll Gathering (IV)][Hanya]: Let's go, we must try to squeeze some answers out of Cirrus.

[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Well, well, insects who don't know when to quit. I sense you have questions... Go on, ask away.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Huohuo is missing, and I'm willing to bet you know something about it!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: How careless... Your companion vanishes right under your noses, and you fail to notice. Why am I the one you're pestering?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: She left without a word — someone clearly deceived her.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: You lied to her about Tail's whereabouts.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: The Ten-Lords Commission might not be able to completely eradicate the heliobi, but we have plenty of ways of dealing with them...
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Ooh, how threatening, hehe... Save your breath, I know your tactics.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Let's cut to the chase. I do know something about it.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: According to the Ten-Lords Commission's understanding of heliobi behavior, they tend to roam densely populated areas in search of hosts... and wherever they go, there are bound to be reports of "supernatural phenomena."
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: I knew it!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Believe it or not, while you were distracted, she came and found me. She asked me if I knew where "Mr. Tail" was, and I simply gave her a clue...
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: She searched high and low, but came back empty-handed, of course. If only you could have seen her expression— simultaneously terrified and desperate to know more — utterly hilarious!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: In the end, I became fed up with her constant nagging. I told her that her beloved Tail had splintered and been reduced to an ember without a single memory... You should've seen her face!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Don't bully Huohuo!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Aw, does it hurt? You'll be pleased to know I didn't drag out the suffering. I told her that her Tail was hiding in Cloudford — preparing to flee the Xianzhou on a starskiff.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: ...Where is she!?
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: I started feeling sorry for her. Out of pity I told her that her Tail was hiding in Cloudford — preparing to flee the Xianzhou on a starskiff.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: I also told her that the Ten-Lords Commission was in the process of recapturing all the heliobi. If she were to turn to you for help, "Mr. Tail" would be imprisoned — even if she managed to find him. Looks like she took the bait...
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Lies! You can't possibly know where Tail disappeared to!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Maybe I do, maybe I don't. But I have no doubt about one thing: my friends are ready and waiting for her in Cloudford!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: How could Huohuo be tricked so easily?
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: I tricked you, didn't I?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Then that means Huohuo is...
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: You should have faith in your friend... Perhaps Huohuo is safe and sound — perhaps she's managed to subdue the heliobi? If you rush to Cloudford, there's still a chance you might find her...
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Not good! Sushang,  let's head to Cloudford, quickly!
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: The paperwork will have to wait. I'm coming with you.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Still here, huh? Then I guess you're not too concerned about your friend.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Huohuo! Huohuo!
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: What do we do now? I'll go get help from the Alchemy Commission.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Hold on, let me take a look at her.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Hanya does a check on Huohuo
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: She's unresponsive. It looks like a heliobus has taken control of her mind.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: How could this happen?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Huohuo spent a long time in coexistence with a heliobus — it is likely she became accustomed to that state. With Tail now gone, she was relatively defenseless against other heliobi.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Should we try using the Harmonic Chime?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: This isn't just a heliobus illusion, it's a complete sensory barrier — cutting off the individual from the outside world. In this case, even the Harmonic Chime won't work.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: This isn't something the healers at the Alchemy Commission can handle. I'll take Huohuo back to the Ten-Lords Commission — perhaps they'll have an answer.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: As for now, I'm temporarily suspending the activities of the ghost-hunting squad.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: But...
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: The situation has changed completely. Without the assistance of a judge, continuing would place all of you in grave danger — defeating the purpose of the squad.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: But, Miss Hanya, this is to save our friend!
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: I know, I understand. But please, let the Ten-Lords Commission deal with this. We'll find a way to extract this heliobus from Huohuo.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Miss Hanya, tell me straight... Does the Ten-Lords Commission actually have a solution?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Surely the Ten-Lords can fix this?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Let's interrogate Cirrus!
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Yeah, Cirrus is bound to know what this heliobus is up to.
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: No, we shouldn't do what they expect us to. They've been manipulating us from Fyxestroll Garden all along. We need to find out what they really want before we go any further.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: We are not completely out of options.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: It might be possible to use another heliobus to drive out the one that seized Huohuo's mind.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: But why would a heliobus ever want to help people? Wait... Miss Hanya, do you mean to say that...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Hanya takes out her Lunaumbra Gourd
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: I've been keeping Tail here, all along...
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: W-What?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Don't look so surprised, young lady!
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: Surprised!? Huohuo has been worried sick trying to find you, and now something else has gone after her!
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: You flaming furball! What the heck is going on!? Did you know about this the whole time, Miss Hanya?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: As per our rules, any free-roaming heliobus must be sealed away. I was merely following protocol. Besides, it was Tail who requested this...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: It's a long story...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: I only recall a moment during that fateful night when my consciousness was on the verge of shattering into a million pieces... time stood still.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: I watched myself parting from Ignamar — drifting without purpose... Then, before I knew what had happened, the girl had retrieved me, and a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission had sealed me within a tail.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: I believe you humans call this kind of thing an "end-of-life-experience..." but why would a heliobus experience one of those? Ridiculous...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Since I'd slipped the leash, I thought I might as well change bodies and savor a bit of freedom. But then—
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Lucky for you, you met me.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: ...My luck took a sour turn when I ran into this demoness... I mean, judge.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: When I was with Huohuo, she'd constantly rant about me — whining about all the problems I'd caused her, how I'd ruined her life.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Hehe, it was only after I vanished that she realized she'd taken my power for granted. I wanted to hear her cry about it, so in a fit of anger I had this demon— uh, judge imprison me in the gourd.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: You had had your wish. Now, I'm offering you a chance to regain your freedom... not by letting you go, but by going back to the way things were. Do we have a deal?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Can I trust you, Tail?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Of course! We're pretty much co-workers at this point!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Hmm... So all I have to do is possess Huohuo and take out those other pesky heliobi... right?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Time to give this heedless creature a reality check!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: It's all up to you now, Tail!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: It's exorcism o'clock!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Wait a minute, I'm still not ready.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Not ready? I'm the one doing the possessing here!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Ugh... Fine. As a courtesy, I'll wait. Tell me when you're ready.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Where... where am I? T—Tail, are you here?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: I... I feel like I've been possessed. Tail, is that you?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...No, it can't be him. Tail always said only the most privileged are worthy of being his host.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...Stop overthinking, Huohuo. What should I do now?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Mom?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Is this an illusion? Mom, what are you doing here? I've missed you so much.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: S—Stay back! Don't come any closer!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: I don't know who you are, but you're not my Huohuo. Keep that filthy thing you're carrying away from me!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: But mom, it's me, Huohuo.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: But I'm still me... I'm the one in control...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: I—It's just a matter of time before it takes control of you...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: ...Is my sister[Note 1] okay?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...Is my sister okay?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: The farther you stay away from her, the better.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: I'm sorry, Huohuo, your father and I had no choice but to send you to the Ten-Lords Commission. It's best if you pretend we never existed...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Even though she knows this is just a mirage made by the heliobus, Huohuo's breathing still gets heavier after her mother leaves.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: H—Hey... I remember you...
[Foxian Dream][Mean classmate]: Huohuo's tail is all singed! It looks like a giant sparkler!
[Foxian Dream][Scared Classmate]: Stay away from us, monster!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Mean classmate]: Huh? Trying to make us feel sorry for you? I can't stand people who do that!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: I'm not...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: I—I'm not trying to make you feel sorry for me...
[Foxian Dream][Mean classmate]: I heard your parents don't want you anymore — YOU should be the one feeling sorry.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: You're... You're all so mean!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: You're all so mean...
[Foxian Dream][Scared Classmate]: Blame that freaky tail of yours! No one else has a tail that catches fire! Get lost!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Scared Classmate]: Playing dumb? Don't wanna talk? Ugh!
[Foxian Dream][Scared Classmate]: We shouldn't be talking to a monster, anyway. Let's get out of here
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Even though she knows this is just a mirage made by the heliobus, Huohuo still feels depressed after her classmates leave.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: But... I'm not a monster...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: What should I do?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Tail...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Tail? How are you... how are you still here? ...I see now... You're leaving me too...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Ha!?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Everyone always leaves me... I don't want to be alone, not again...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: I haven't left!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Please, Tail, no more words! I can't bear to see you fade away...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Are you a judge or not!? This heliobus is distorting your perceptions! Get a grip! Resist them!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: They've all gone... all abandoned me...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: "All gone?" Just watch me, I'll drag them all back!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Everyone will leave... they always do, eventually...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: What about your ghost-hunting buddies?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: What about your ghost-hunting buddies?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...They aren't here.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: What about those Ten Lords fogeys?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: What about those Ten Lords fogeys?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...They aren't here.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: You have me, don't you?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: You have me, don't you?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Just wait, I'm going to bring everyone here!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Possess
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Tail possesses Huohuo's mother and tries to bring her back to Huohuo.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Let's bring this one back.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: Huohuo, I'm sorry. It's better that you pretend mom and dad are no longer here...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: How can your own flesh and blood be so heartless? These humans...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Tail takes Huohuo's mother back to her
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Possess
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Tail possesses the mean classmate and tries to bring him back to Huohuo
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Let's bring this one back.
[Foxian Dream][Mean classmate]: Why does Huohuo get so much attention!? Hmph, I'm gonna get everyone to ignore her...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: The behavior of these brats is astounding.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Tail possesses the two and tries to bring them back to Huohuo together.
[Foxian Dream][Scared Classmate]: This tail is just so creepy! It glows like some sort of torch, gross!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Hey! Wanna lose a hand!?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Huohuo, look, I brought everyone back for you.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...Wh—Who's back?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Huohuo's Mother: Huohuo, our precious girl... Mom and dad shouldn't have left you all alone.
[Foxian Dream][Mean classmate]: Huohuo, I'm sorry... I was just jealous that your tail is cooler than mine!
[Foxian Dream][Scared Classmate]: Huohuo, I've always dreamt about having such a cool tail. Why don't you come play with me?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: They're only here because you possessed them and made them come back. This isn't what I meant...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Oh c'mon! You wanted them to return — they returned!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Tail... you're not an illusion... You're here! You're actually Tail!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Where have you been all this time? I thought you were already...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: ...Dead? Well, I haven't exactly had a picnic — exploding into countless shards, being your shadow for all those rotten years — it's about time I had some good luck!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: I thought about getting out of here, but I couldn't shake the feeling there was something wrong... so I came back to see if you could manage on your own, or if you were still a scaredy-cat.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: I'm sorry... I guess I still am...
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: No, you're selling yourself short! You're daring! How you had the courage to do something so dangerous amazes me! It's not bravery you lack, but sense!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...What other choice did I have? I suspected that Cirrus was deceiving me, but the thought of losing you forever was... unbearable.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Forget about all that, I'm here now. But... did everyone really leave you because of me?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: They left, let them be.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: You know what? They left, let them be. I'm not a people person anyway. Without you, Tail, they'd have left me just the same...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: But at least you're back now, right?
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...but you came back for me... and that's all I need.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Well, since you put it like that, I suppose I have nothing to feel guilty about anymore!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: ...Somebody needs to keep you out of trouble! Speaking of which, there's a pesky heliobus lurking right here. I'm coming for you!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Don't even think about escaping!
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Huohuo, you're awake! Seems like Tail's "operation" was a success!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Huh... Madam Hanya, Miss Gui, Sushang, and  ...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Thank you, all of you. Are you the ones who brought Tail back?
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Well, where would we be without our squad leader? We had to help!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Oh, so scaredy-cat is squad leader? Well, well, look at you!
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: That's just what Miss Guinaifen calls me... hehe.
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: Well, well, Tail actually does belong to Miss Huohuo!
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Excuse me?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Despite Cirrus's scheming and calculating, they clearly didn't expect Tail to return to Huohuo... their plan to kidnap her was an utter failure. If they saw Huohuo as she is now, it would break their will!
[Foxian Dream][Spiritfarer Messenger]: Madam Hanya! Urgent news from Fyxestroll Garden! The subdued heliobi are stirring again!
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: ...Cirrus may not know the location of Tail, but they still figured out a way to divert everyone's attention.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: This was definitely Cirrus's ruse to divert our attention
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Cirrus may come across as hot-headed and impulsive, but under the surface they are actually full of guile...
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: No wonder they like to use analogies such as "pawns" and "chess" to describe people. One momentary lapse of concentration, and suddenly we find ourselves backed into a corner.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Cirrus was waiting for us to leave Fyxestroll Garden all along.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...It's not because of me, is it?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: There's no need to blame yourself. This was Cirrus's plan all along.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: It looks like the "endgame" that General Jing Yuan has been trying to avoid is fast approaching. Sushang, please head to the Seat of Divine Foresight and fetch the general.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Let's hurry back to Fyxestroll Garden now, while there's still a chance to turn things around. It's time to teach Cirrus a lesson.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Tsk, tsk, if it isn't the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission — sluggish as ever.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Oh, and is that "Mr. Tail"? Back to being a guard dog I see — how delightful... This calls for a celebration!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Still, after our last encounter, I've no intention of including you in my plans. To see Ignamar's most powerful fragment now burdened with emotions pains me. It's a pity, but you've become expendable.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Who are you calling expendable!?
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: The Ten-Lords Commission's matrix is still intact — the heliobi cannot leave Fyxestroll Garden. You may think you have the upper hand, but you're nothing more than a caged animal. You will never leave here.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Leave? That was never my plan. I came to Fyxestroll Garden for one reason, and one reason alone — to fight the Luofu's formidable general.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: He seemed fond of playing the waiting game — I merely capitalized on that. While you were all out on a wild goose chase, I rallied other heliobi to my cause, thereby increasing my strength!
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Thanks to all of you, I've amassed the power of every heliobus sealed within Fyxestroll Garden. All I need to do now is wait for the general to make his grand entrance.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Before that happens, I should keep my end of the bargain: destroying you without leaving a trace.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: They keep on coming back for more... What should we do, Tail?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Take it easy, kid. Heliobi might lack physical form, but they're not impervious to physical attacks. Cirrus is merely putting on a brave face.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: The moment they sense even a hint of defeat, it's over — they'll break into pieces, regardless of how powerful they are.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: So just like what happened to Ignamar, once a heliobus realizes they're going to lose, they'll shatter?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Exactly. And If there's anyone who can cause Cirrus to shatter, it's him...
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: So, general, you've finally decided to show up. Ready to face the music?
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Defeat my army, and I'll give you the rematch you seek. My word holds true.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: As I mentioned previously, when Teng Xiao and Ignamar fought, the scales were balanced.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: But for you, Cirrus, this game was never about fairness, was it? And yet here we are — my power decidedly outmatches yours.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Notions of rules and equal competition are mere illusions. Now, if you don't mind, allow me to show you how the endgame is played.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Accept your defeat, you are bested.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: The fate of humans means nothing to me.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: We play by our own set of rules.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Checkmate.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: ...I concede.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Good.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: I am no Ignamar... I'm nothing... nothing more than a faint flicker.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: I know of no "faint flicker" that could strategize such a fierce battle against one of the Reignbow Arbiter's generals.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Listening to a winner feign humility is enough to make one sick.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: The heliobi may reflect our desires, but their fervent blaze... is undeniably awe-inspiring. Neither General Teng Xiao nor myself would deride such a foe.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: I have been bested, it's true... I only sought to lock horns with you, regardless of victory or defeat. Next...
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Next is eternal punishment. For an inextinguishable flame such as yourself, I see no punishment more fitting than to see you confined to a vacant abyss, forever lamenting your past transgressions.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Such is the fate that awaits you, Cirrus.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Hehe, so be it...
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: Mountains will crumble, oceans will evaporate, but the heliobi will always be there, patiently waiting for their day of freedom... and that day will come.
[Foxian Dream][Cirrus]: As long as the generals of the Xianzhou live, my battle against them will continue, until the stars themselves burn out.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Cirrus's will to fight has been shattered — they can no longer pose a threat. Considering that everything here is now under control, I'll take my leave.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Thanks for stepping in, General.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: I merely fulfilled my duty, and kept my promise to Cirrus.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: My masterstroke wasn't that bad after all?
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: Not at all. You have been of great assistance these past days, and for that I express my gratitude.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: But the heliobus we dealt with will not be easily dismissed. Given sufficient time, and regardless of how slim the odds are, they will someday break the seal that binds them. However, that concern will fall to the generals of the future.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: One cannot help but wonder how many Luofu generals this fragment of Ignamar will face in times to come. Speaking purely from the perspective of a warrior, I must say I feel somewhat envious.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: The heliobi's objective is pretty simple, don't you think?
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: That it may be, but they cause no shortage of trouble. Perhaps I could glean some wisdom from the Xianzhou Zhuming...
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: It would've been easier if you'd stepped in from the start...
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: In my estimation, this heliobus was not an overwhelming problem for you. Besides, each of you has appeared to gain something from this series of events.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: This excursion was not an official matter — I didn't report it to the counselors. What remains of it will be left to the Ten-Lords Commission, and once matters have concluded, I believe everyone present will be duly rewarded.
[Foxian Dream][Jing Yuan]: And as for you and the young Miss Guinaifen, rest assured you won't be short-changed. You see? Helping the general of the Luofu does have its perks. It's time I took my leave. Farewell.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: You're here. I've just finished re-inscribing the seal on Huohuo's tail. Next, it's time to address the matter of Cirrus.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: So... Mr. Tail chose to be sealed once again...?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: What do you know? This is between me and the Ten-Lords Commission — a non-aggression pact, if you like.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: I thought Mr. Tail wanted to leave...?
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: If I were merely Starfire Essence, then naturally I'd prefer to glide through the cosmos... but after being entangled in your human world, my freedom is no longer that simple.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: I am freer than ever before... I am going nowhere.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Mm... According to the Ten-Lords, Tail must be supervised by a judge... I'll make sure to take good care of Mr. Tail.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Tsk, let's see who takes care of who.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: ...Besides, when Mr. Tail isn't around, the other heliobi pick on me. I feel safer when Tail is here.
[Foxian Dream][Tail]: Other heliobi? Hmph, I'm the only heliobus you need to worry about.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Well then, I will take care of the Cirrus situation. As for what gets written in the Luofu's Ghostly Grove, I'll leave that up to you.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: One more thing, don't forget to seal the heliobi within the Evil Binding Matrix.
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Yes ma'am!
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Expel evil and capture stray spirits... With the support of the Ten Lords Commission's spiritfarers, you seal the heliobi within the Lunaumbra Gourd.
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: I wrote to my mom about the recent monster-slaying and demon-fighting stuff I've been doing for the Ten-Lords Commission.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: What did you tell her?
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: I told her I went toe-to-toe with the swordfighting prodigy Yanqing and held my own against fragments of Ignamar. But all she did was scold me for getting into trouble! Doyoung you think she was being sarcastic?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Perhaps she's worried you're neglecting your regular duties?
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: What could be more important than protecting the Xianzhou from the threat of heliobi?
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: ...You still have a lot to learn.
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: You sound just like her...
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Haha, quit worrying Sushang, you've been an awesome squad member! And a very talented sleepyhead.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Hee-hee, thanks bestie.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Now, let's think about what to publish on Ghostly Grove! This is huge news — this post will definitely boost our following.
[Foxian Dream][Sushang]: Always on the hunt for more followers...
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: It's called professionalism, alright?
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: I'm counting on you, !
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: The ghost-hunting squad can now rest easy for a while. Speaking as a judge of the Ten-Lords Commission, I must thank you all for the dedication you've shown these past few days. You really minimized the impact of the heliobi crisis.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: There may have been a few heliobi that slipped through the net, but they are of no major concern.
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Leave them to us!
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: I don't wanna brag, but our articles on Ghostly Grove are the talk of the town! If we suddenly stopped uploading, it'd be pretty unfair to our audience.
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Miss Gui...
[Foxian Dream][Huohuo]: Madam Hanya, p—please, let Little Gui carry on uploading... I can't fall asleep without browsing Ghostly Grove before bed...
[Foxian Dream][Hanya]: Hmm... You seem pretty set on this, so I won't stand in your way. However, bear in mind that—
[Foxian Dream][Guinaifen]: Don't worry, we promise not to make your job any harder than it already is.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Let's sync up our intel as per usual.
[Foxian Dream][Narration]: Remember to share the account updates.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: I thought member #4, Polka Kakamond, had gotten rid of most of the Society members. I didn't have a lot of hope for this... Oh? Look who's here.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: You're back, ?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: There's quite the crowd here today...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Of course. This is a summit between three geniuses.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: It's a special time — all departments are preparing to welcome distinguished guests from the Genius Society.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: Madam Ruan Mei doesn't like fanfare and probably wouldn't appreciate a crowd to welcome her, so I asked the researchers to keep things simple.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: I took her to see the portraits of the Society members a few days ago. I wanted to have the researchers make one for her as well, but she declined the offer.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: I don't get it. Whatever. As long as she's happy.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: I heard Miss Ruan Mei likes snacks and pastries, so I asked the researchers to prepare some traditional desserts from the Blue. All of them seemed to tickle her fancy.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Would I be able to meet Ruan Mei?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Of course, go find her yourself. She borrowed the Phase Flame to do some research as soon as she got here — haven't seen a trace of her since.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Is Ruan Mei a great person?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: That's like asking "Is Herta a great person?" The answer is obvious!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: Miss Ruan Mei is the very image of a scholar. I heard she once took a little vacation on a desert planet. By the time she left, she'd miraculously created a boom in the local ecology!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: She just wanted somewhere uninhabited to experiment with her "Life Helix System." Ruan Mei is certainly very talented, but she hardly interacts with anyone. She lives like a hermit. Pity.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Anyway. What more needs to be said for someone smart enough to become Herta's research partner, hmm? Hurry up and head out, . See if you can find her.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Where is Ruan Mei right now?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: I'm not sure, but she doesn't seem to get around much. She spends most of her time between the master control zone and the railway platform. Maybe you can start your search there?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Asta]: Miss Ruan Mei is the very image of a scholar. I heard she once took a little vacation on a desert planet. By the time she left, she'd miraculously created a boom in the local ecology!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Anyway. What more needs to be said for someone smart enough to become Herta's research partner, hmm? Hurry up and head out, . See if you can find her.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Hello. I hope I didn't startle you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: This is a work habit of mine — using touch to open my senses and letting the details of your biological existence flood into my brain helps me understand your construction as a living organism.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Such is the basis of deconstruction and reconstruction. Do not be concerned. You are very healthy — in fact, impeccably so. A perfect experimental specimen. I like perfect experimental specimens.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: We finally meet.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Yes, I'm happy to meet you too. We've met before in the Simulated Universe.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: There's a bit of cake on the corner of your mouth...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Oh? Really?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I expect the views here had me lost in thought...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I don't usually go in and out of the space station, and only discovered today that it was blessed with such calm, open views. It is a wonderful fit for the sweet fragrance of lotus leaves, plum blossom, sticky rice, and frosting sugar.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Come here. Look, the blue planet is directly below us. It is so full of life. This dessert is very delicious. Here, take half.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Take a bite.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: No, I'm good.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: You don't like it? I worked very hard on it. You should at least have a try.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Delicious desserts remind people of how flowers look when they bloom. Ingest this dessert one bite at a time, and the sweetness will linger in your mouth.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I hope you like it too.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You ate Ruan Mei's snack.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: So, what do you think? I can certainly prepare more for you. It's become somewhat of a tradition to bring strawberry pastries when I visit Stephen Lloyd. His attendance seems quite dependent on them.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Mmm, an outstanding dessert. Ten grams of cubed sugar, one dried and salt-preserved plum blossom. Baking and cooking are the same as nurturing a universe. The heat must be controlled, planning must be meticulous, and one must not panic... no matter what happens.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Unfortunately, there are still too many people in the space station. The clamor is not fitting for desserts. By the way...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: , do you remember what my "research" is about?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Only that it's about biology.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Something about nurturing lifeforms...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : No. My research area is short stories about toilets.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I see. What a cute hobby.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: But remember, the next time something like this happens it's crucial to mask your expression until you've ascertained the situation. If not...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: ...you'll be full of weaknesses that others can see through.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Let's try again. Now, , what else would you like to ask?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What do you mean...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What did you do to me...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What did you feed me...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : The dessert was tasty. I would like more.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: You have quite the appetite. Alright, I'll give you the recipe.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Come and have a walk with me. A stroll is the most appropriate post-dessert activity.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: As the masses depart, there's an enveloping calm here, just like in the "No Man's Land" I've ventured to in the past.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: ... Can you imagine a completely lifeless world?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: From there, you can glimpse the stars that lie at the very edge of the horizon.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Following its celestial trajectory, the great teal star illuminates an endless sea of white across both the sky and land.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: My mother and I navigated calm glaciers looking for signs of life on that world... and encountered many bizarre phenomena.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: It was like finding the single correct piece in a mountain of jigsaw pieces. The process was convoluted and unimaginably difficult, but it was touching and enthralling as well.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: From then on, whenever I come across a familiar scene, I find myself pausing to take it all in.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: My apologies, it appears my words have left you perplexed. Please, don't be on edge — I bear no ill will. I haven't interfered with your linguistic faculties — such an act would be impolite... I merely made a minor adjustment.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: A few days ago, I made my interest in you known to Herta. My intention is for you to serve as an "assistant." Based on our interactions within the Simulated Universe, I firmly believe you fit the bill.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I find extending trust beyond myself is challenging. A single error in detailed research can generate issues, and I despise matters that escape my control.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Therefore, I added Anti-Truth Serum to this dessert. It will not harm you. However, you will be unable to say what you truly think when answering questions related to me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Treat it as a layer of protection. This will shield my research and your personal safety. Once the problems have been dealt with, I'll give you the antidote.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I can also reward you as compensation for being my assistant. I will fulfill your every wish.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Problems?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Yes... problems wrought by my own hand.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You don't trust me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Does that bother you? I believe we will be able to be frank with each other, but that needs time.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I'm still upset.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Then I'll grant you even greater rewards.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: When I first arrived on the space station, I borrowed the Phase Flame from Herta — it's an invention of member #29 Sserkal. I hoped to be enlightened by other Society members' results.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: A surge of creativity led me to explore the cultivation of life on the space station.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: In my imagination, these lifeforms would be a new variety that are born as geniuses. I planned to name them after Lambda, member #8 of the Genius Society...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I don't know where it went wrong. They possess their own sentience, but are nowhere near geniuses.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Moreover, my "free-range" approach seems to have backfired. In a lab leak incident a few days ago, some of these "little lifeforms" ran away and scattered all over the space station.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I do not wish for Herta or Asta to be involved in this. Therefore... I'm hoping you can assist in recovering these little lifeforms.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You can try trusting me, you know.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I do trust you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Why don't you want them to know?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: This has nothing to do with them. Besides, the more people involved, the more problems there will be.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Okay...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: The researchers are still treating these entities as visitors... I want to steer clear of making my presence known, so as not to cause undue disturbances.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I entrust this to you. Once the little lifeforms are collected, simply find a proper place for them. The researchers in the Department of Ecology should know about this and provide you with suitable advice.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: As the masses depart, there's an enveloping calm here... just like the "No Man's Land" I ventured to in the past.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Did you do research there?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Yes. My mother and I once spent 11 long polar nights there.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: What? A place where the space station stores "dangerous experimental results"?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Why would anyone want to know that... Wait! Did someone send you here to try to get things out of me?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: I'm not doing any private business on the space station! I have absolutely no knowledge of any special hiding places. And I certainly haven't sold any old junk, rare treasures, or discarded Curios or anything like that!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I didn't even ask...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Hmph, I'm not hiding anything at all! You're the sneaky one! What do you want?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei asked me to do this.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : You're so cute! Can I get an autograph?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Autograph? What are you on about!? You're freaking me out!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: I won't talk to you if you don't tell me why you're here.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I heard there are some problems on the space station.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei is asking for me to recover the leaked experimental specimens.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : I'll solve the space station's problems!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: ...Oh, that? You've got pretty good contacts if you know that already. The space station is a mess. Everyone's already swamped as it is, and now out of nowhere, there are a bunch of little creatures popping up.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: If you want to solve the problem, go check out the storage zone. Then you'll understand.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Implement Researcher]: Molten Cheese Tart is the best! Its outlook is infectious! Its positive mood has influenced us all!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Implement Researcher]: What's our slogan again? One: Stop complaining, change your attitude, and use the delicious Molten Cheese Tart to stop the flow of negative energy.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Implement Researcher]: Two: Energize yourself, increase your capacity for action, and walk on the path of Molten Cheese Tart's absolute conviction.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Our creed: Molten Cheese Tart is the best!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Who is Molten Cheese Tart?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Oh praise be! You don't know? Molten Cheese Tart is Madam Ruan Mei's top fan! This is how it preaches. Those who offer their love are expressing admiration and affection for Miss Ruan Mei.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What about Screwllum's followers?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Let me tell you something, Mr. Screwllum's followers are all very logical, but they're just awaiting the arrival of the mechanical aristocracy.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What about Stephen's followers?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Who?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Hmph, since you're so interested, I'll tell you how to secure an audience with the honorable Molten Cheese Tart. You'll need to work hard to get there.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: You need to plaster hearts wherever Madam Ruan Mei has been. If you're sincere enough, the honorable Molten Cheese Tart will show itself!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Hey, guess what I got my hands on? Word on the street is that this is the downgraded version of Ruan Mei's life cultivation formula.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: It says: 10 carats of ingenuity, 1 tonne of practice, 30 particles of starquake, and a few drops of poisonous liquor from Madam Yu Qingtu. Rumor has it that it once created a talking chair! Not a particularly intelligent one, but boy did it have a sharp tongue — they dismantled it and used it for firewood. Can you believe it?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Let's give it a shot, shall we? First things first, we need to pick out the ingredients.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: A constantly burning passion
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: A confidence that came out of nowhere
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Courage to drink 2 bottles of Kapo-Kali in one go!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Hmm... we need to add some other good stuff in. But don't go overboard...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: IQ
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: EQ
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Beauty
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Mm... and now we mix them together. Wait! It says on the recipe: "Ruan Mei makes different expressions when nurturing life..."
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei frowns
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: The corner of Ruan Mei's mouth twitches
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei is suppressing her emotions
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei is expressionless
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Yikes... take a look at what you just cultivated.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You have nurtured a copy of a Trotter!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Replicated Trotter]: Oink oink!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You have nurtured a copy of a five nut milk-flavored lifeform!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Milk Almond Lifeform]: Woof woof woof!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You have nurtured a coriander sesame paste lifeform!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Coriander Sesame Paste Lifeform]: Eeep, eeep...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You have nurtured a copy of a Phase Flame!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Replicated Phase Flame]: Hehe!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Madam Herta doesn't care about her at all...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Ruan Mei, member #81 of the Genius Society — a resounding name in science and the veritable epitome of lifeform cultivation. Researchers here have heard so much about her for so long!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: But once she arrived on the space station, she just took over everything. And what did Madam Herta do? Absolutely nothing...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Herta is spoiling Ruan Mei.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : Never fear, the Galactic Baseballer is here!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Took over everything?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: Yes, she's treating this place like her backyard! She's leaving her research notes all over the floor!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Department of Ecology Researcher]: The end result? Everyone's obsessed with getting their hands on them...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: I heard that when Ruan Mei is researching...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: Ruan Mei likes to listen to the space station radio during her research.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: Some of us younger researchers are her superfans — we're always scanning different frequencies to find out what her tastes are! Do you know her favorite tunes, by any chance?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei likes to listen to new-style opera.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei likes to listen to new-style storytelling.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : No idea. I just listen to comedy skits.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: As expected. You look like you belong in a comedy skit yourself.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: Ruan Mei's preferences...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: I heard Madam Ruan Mei is very picky when it comes to snacks. , do you know what her favorites are?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei likes plum blossom cakes that are freshly salted.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : I don't know about her, but I loooove fermented herring.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: Did I ask about your favorites? Also, that's disgusting — what's wrong with you?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I don't know.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Insight Researcher]: Fine. Ugh, what a headache...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's creation jumps onto the table!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : Um... so this...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : ...is the "little lifeform" Ruan Mei made?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: A researcher appears out of nowhere next to you...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": I am humbled to meet the Molten Cheese Tart!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": What are you frozen in place for? Oh, you don't understand the honorable tart? That's okay! No worries, for situations like this, we've specifically concocted a Synesthesia Beacon!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Activate the Synesthesia Beacon.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It actually made my voice!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Immediately deactivate the specific Synesthesia Beacon.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Molten Cheese Tart says, "Madam Ruan Mei has finally recognized my ingenuity!"
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Molten Cheese Tart says, "Does Madam Ruan Mei recognize me as a masterpiece?"
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Molten Cheese Tart says, "Madam Ruan Mei still has not recognized me as a lifeform that passes the requirements. I need to work harder!" Ah! Such an enthusiastic Molten Cheese Tart!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": There's a kind of attachment reserved for the creator. To the world, you are but one person. But to me, you are the entire world — Ahh, Madam Ruan Mei!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Hey, you. Yes, you — don't you have anything you wanna say to Molten Cheese Tart? You should at least express how you would like to follow Molten Cheese Tart! We wouldn't want to mistake you for an agent of Gray Bean Paste, would we?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I follow Molten Cheese Tart.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Good. You have great taste!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I like Gray Bean Paste!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Get lost and get as far away from here as you can!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: There's no way Ruan Mei would like you!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : You heartless dessert.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": You! Shh! Quiet!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Oh, the honorable Molten Cheese Tart may have a crispy exterior, but deep down inside, it's incredibly sensitive and delicate.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": It's working so hard just to get Madam Ruan Mei's attention!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": You see, the honorable Molten Cheese Tart has always been fighting against Gray Bean Paste in terms of flavor. The honorable Molten Cheese Tart is a firm believer that people's lives need to be optimistic.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": They both hope to receive Madam Ruan Mei's recognition and have been working so hard.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: How did Ruan Mei make desserts into lifeforms...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": You need to call it the honorable Molten Cheese Tart!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You like the taste of Molten Cheese Tart?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Of course. It's not like we have any followers of Gray Bean Paste here.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": All the ones who came here to stir up trouble have been converted by us. They went from refusing Molten Cheese Tart to loving it.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": This is called "conceptual annexation of tastes."
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": It's genuinely puzzling. Despite Molten Cheese Tart's remarkable qualities, why hasn't Madam Ruan Mei acknowledged it? It's clear that it yearns for her love.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What kind of "love" though?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Love from the creator to her creation? Familial love? Doesn't sound right... romantic love? Definitely not!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": I don't know! Expecting me to understand "love" is like asking me to map the farthest reaches of the universe!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Remember, as long as love is your compass, you're on the right track. And in the wise words of the honorable Molten Cheese Tart: Love must be shouted from the rooftops!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Can I talk alone with Molten Cheese Tart?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Th—That depends on if the honorable Tart agrees to it...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: "Creations' Translator": Oh? The honorable Molten Cheese Tart has agreed!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You try to communicate with Ruan Mei's creation and get it away...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You realized Ruan Mei's creation cannot be put in at all...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It opens its innocent eyes wide. You now have to explain to it that this has to be done in order to send it back to Ruan Mei's side...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Confess! Why are you stirring up trouble on the space station!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It seems to believe that only by being passionate can it earn Ruan Mei's approval.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Confess! Do you like molten cheese tarts?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It seems to believe that this is a flavor that can bring happiness.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It seems resentful for being an "unqualified" life form.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's Creation:
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It seems eager to achieve great things! It wants to fully embrace its own philosophy and is inviting you to join in!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: You have to be firm, believing this is the best place for it...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Tenderly activate the teleporter.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Callously activate the teleporter.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Ruan Mei's little lifeform was ruthlessly flushed down the john. It will be safely transported to storage zone.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: You're here, .
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Herta called Screwllum and I to the space station to discuss some important topics. She also sent an invite to Stephen, but he didn't reply and Herta didn't seem to want to wait any longer.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: And now... I wish for you to attend this meeting with me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Why with me?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I don't want Herta to worry herself over these frivolous matters, even though she probably wouldn't care anyway.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Just in case, I want someone who will be on my side — in other words, you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Help me — it'll be easy. Just remember: My secret stays with you. Don't pry too much, and keep your expressions in check.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Alright...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Alright, let's go.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Let me think...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Alright. There's no rush.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Why hasn't Ruan Mei come?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Hi, Ruan Mei, I've been waiting for you. Oh, you're here too? Looks like you two have become quite friendly.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: It's good to see you, . Affirmation: This reunion has happened earlier than my calculations predicted.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Though you weren't invited, I welcome you to remember this historical moment, . How long has it been since three geniuses were in the same room together? And how long will we have to wait for it to happen again?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: Affirmative. Discounting our discussions on the Simulated Universe, our interactions are scarce. I look forward to the innovative ideas that may emerge from this juxtaposition of minds.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Let me get straight to the point. I think it's time to find another partner for the Simulated Universe.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: ...You wish to kick Stephen out?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: No, of course not! Stephen doesn't want to get involved and voted to abstain — whatever. Look, I respect the way people want to live, but he doesn't have the chance to be involved in this decision-making anymore.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: Question: Are we introducing a fifth partner for the Simulated Universe?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Yes. A fifth genius.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: The reason for our gathering is clear to everyone present. What else could prompt such a gathering of brilliant minds except for the "answer"?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: No one can refuse the secret of the Aeons, not even Zandar. We'll definitely get a response.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: What if the responder is Polka Kakamond?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: That'd be great! Hey, Lord of Silence, are you listening? I'm member #83, Herta, and I want to meet you. I believe you and I will have a lot to talk about.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: It's unlikely we'll hear from Polka Kakamond. She's been off the grid for quite some time.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: Probability: Member #64, Dr. Primitive, may appear.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: That's a hard pass. Given Dr. Primitive's shady research practices and his tussle with the Galaxy Rangers, the IPC will surely turn this into a media circus... he can get lost. I'd prefer it if the Simulated Universe remained scandal-free.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: What about Yu Qingtu? Are you still in touch with her, Ruan Mei? Is she still alive?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: ...Can we ask  to leave if we are to discuss this topic? The process will be long... and boring. There's no need to take up other people's time.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Of course. You brought  in, after all. It's up to you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Alright, let me walk you out.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Aaaand what the heck is this?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Seems like a programming error.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: , this fragment of Ruan Mei — have you seen it in the Simulated Universe before?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Yes.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: : The Simulated Universe is my home!
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: No.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: It's probably an isolated glitch.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Fine, I'm used to turning a blind eye to these things — it makes life easier. I am curious though... are you gonna keep it, Ruan Mei?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I probably will. Records indicate  likes this Occurrence.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Alright, I agree. As long as it helps you with your research, you can do whatever you want.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Come along, . I'll see you out.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: It appears I was overthinking things. Impulsive behavior is pretty characteristic of her after all.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: What's wrong? You're not leaving?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Will there be a fifth genius joining?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Depends on who they are.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I want to know about member #4, Polka Kakamond.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Herta]: Female. Wears a fashionable scarf. I find her rather fascinating.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: The air in the space station has a pleasant quality. Affirmation: Knowledge flows within it.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Will there be a fifth genius joining?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: We anticipate the inclusion of a different perspective. I await our esteemed guest and shall offer the highest courtesies — I'm confident that our discussions will generate illuminating insights.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I want to know about member #64, Dr. Primitive.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: Dr. Primitive's true identity is not known to me. His previous transgressions against humanity lead some to conclude he may be an inorganic entity. Affirmation: All beings, organic or otherwise, should value peace.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: How long will you be staying on the space station?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Screwllum]: I will stay for a while longer. Lady Asta has recently expressed concerns regarding disturbances on the space station. Conclusion: Extended observation is necessary.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I see that you've recovered the lifeform in the master control zone. Thank you, well done.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I didn't end up saying anything.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I was simply being overly cautious. It is a habit of mine. Apologies.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Is there something I shouldn't hear?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: No. You misunderstand. While Herta is tied up in meetings, you might find it more convenient to roam the space station.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: There are some things that I must tell you now. If I wait for the meeting to finish... then it might be too late.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: The retrieval of my lifeforms isn't complete yet. There's more than just one, and some are stored in a sealed zone.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Herta uses that place to welcome visitors from across the stars, or to welcome members of the Genius Society. However, due to the Legion's invasion, it is no longer open to the public.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: And now my "headache" is stored there.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: There are other zones in the space station?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: There's much you don't know about the space station, and even more about Herta.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: But there is some information I can give you. That place is also used to welcome non-humanoid visitors and has a shuttle that connects to outer space.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: So Herta gave you permission to use this place?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: She gave me permission and said no more.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I'm giving you my access card. Give me your hand, and I'll input your fingerprint into it.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Stay vigilant, . Should you come across a threat you can't handle, just alert me. I'll come to your aid, no matter what.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Remember, there is a giant... incubator... in the middle of the zone. That's where my "headache" is stored.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Once you're back, come find me on the railway platform. Then you'll understand everything.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Fried Cold Rice Robot]: *buzz*
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: :
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Fried Cold Rice Robot]: *buzz* Madam Herta, open zone. *buzz* To welcome, alien species, galactic visitors.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Fried Cold Rice Robot]: High-risk zone, *buzz*. Service staff, inorganic lifeforms, *buzz*.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: They simultaneously possess two sets of emotional traits. They are at once cute, weak, sentimental, and sensitive... yet are also fierce, instigating, demanding, and confident.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Interestingly, they also possess a kind of inclination — a yearning for their creator. It manifests as a natural, inherent emotion — similar to that of a baby towards its mother... Life towards sustenance, or the peculiar bond between humans.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Life can exist in thousands of different forms, which means the form itself has no purpose.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: The patterns of all things always have complicated and enchanting exteriors, while their inner essences remain simple and plain. If we were to trace things back to their roots, just one equation would be enough to solve the confusion of all life.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Ever since I was a child, I have always delighted in observing aspects of microscopic creatures... such as the speed with which slime molds devour objects. I have also gazed far and wide across the macroscopic world, investigating the progress of the universe up to this day — it was all very simple.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I wish to discover "the true essence of life," something that all individuals possess unknowingly, whether it is the materialism of their existence or an unknown entity beyond corporeal realms.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: To avoid blind faith in science, I cautiously raised a query... Would Ruan Mei be able to peel away external influences? Just like pinpointing a coordinate, would she be able to uncover life's most primordial and beautiful form of existence...?

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I cannot comprehend what an Emanator is.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Scholars view them as the executors of the Aeons' power. So, when did it begin, and at what point did they become closer to the "Aeons" than any other lifeform?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: At first, I tried to create a genius. I failed. That question has no solution yet, and a long journey of discovery still lies ahead.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: However, Erudition isn't the only Path in the Universe. If we set logic aside, would there be more primitive and pure "Emanators" on other Paths?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Of course there would be.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: It is a logical decision. I will certainly succeed. The entity that I reconstruct will bloom into a life never before seen.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][???]: If a question is of no help, then don't ask it. Time is clearly precious to the both of us.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][???]: *sigh* ...Never mind. Allow me to clarify something. I know exactly who you are, and I'm aware you are in Ruan Mei's employ. This was not my intended destination — I just happened to find my way here during my visit and saw what she was up to.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][???]: My goals are roughly aligned with yours. Since you're here, I won't intercede... but should you fail, I will be forced to prevent some avoidable misfortunes.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][???]: That's all you need to know. Just two paragraphs. Very effective communication.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Like every living being, it inevitably faced its demise as it journeyed towards the end — I find no fault in that.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: However, even the briefest life should have meaning. I want to know the limits of its capacity. It will indicate how far I've gone in a field completely incomprehensible to me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Haha, and it was "a minuscule step" — just as I had predicted.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: It almost ate me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I did say that if a danger proved too great for you, I would personally step in to confront it.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Are you going to keep researching?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Indeed, this is how I keep the distractions at bay. I have to admit that research once made me obsessive — that wasn't a good period in my life, though I now navigate it much more smoothly.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: What about life outside of research?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I do not have a life outside of research. People always think this price is unimaginable, but it seems rather acceptable to me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I must admit, I'm not fond of scenarios where everything aligns perfectly with my expectations. An experiment should have its unforeseen twists.

[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I have to admit that these little ones born in the process... sometimes move me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I see a human-like response in them. It is a concept completely opposite to that of divinity — they have emotions.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Emotions may be either positive or negative. However, the love rooted in the depths of their heart is eternal and unchanging.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: They are still a long way from becoming geniuses and are therefore unable to discern whether this love is one of friendship, romance, or familial love.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: That being said, can even geniuses tell the difference? I cannot, at least... I do not understand what "love" is and cannot respond to their feelings.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: , do you believe my actions were wrong?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: There is no need to tell me your answer. I just... felt like asking the question. How should I take care of them? Perhaps leaving them at the space station is the best choice.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Do I seem irresponsible? I'm sorry. I am often at a loss as to how to face my own creations.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: The effects of the Anti-Truth Serum will also wear off. If others mention me to you in the future, you can answer however you like, or even pretend you never knew me.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: After all, your memory of me will soon dissipate like smoke.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Memory... dissipate?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Over time, hidden truths tend to surface. Past traumas, which I'd rather leave behind, have made me skeptical about trusting anyone but myself.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: If I do not want a secret revealed, the most foolproof way is to destroy it. The Anti-Truth Serum will make you forget the brief period we spent together.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: It won't take effect immediately. It is a slow, intangible process — like the sweet fragrance of lotus leaves, plum blossom, sticky rice, and frosting sugar.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Perhaps you will remember someone performed selfish experiments on the space station, but you will no longer remember their identity. Perhaps we will meet again someday, but you won't be able to connect me with the recollection.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: That way, the connection between lifeforms will be erased. Friendships, secrets, grudges, lies, all will disappear.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: It will make our lives... more relaxing.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: If that is your wish, I will forget you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Thank you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: No, I won't forget you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I believe you.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Screwllum will stay on the space station for a while longer. He and Herta still have problems they need to solve. As for me, I'm leaving soon and won't bother with goodbyes.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Do you still remember the "No Man's Land" I mentioned? I'm considering a solo trip back there during my research downtime, just to see how things are.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I miss member #55, Yu Qingtu sometimes. She used to always make something delicious for me to drink every time we parted ways.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: I hope I won't meet member #4 Polka Kakamond. That would be quite troublesome.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Who knows when the next gathering of geniuses will be? Do you have anything else you want to say to me, ?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: Do you trust me now?
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: ...I find that difficult to answer. I thank you,  Assistant.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Narration]: I hope you'll come back and visit your creations.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: Mm, I promise I will,  Assistant.
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: If fate allows and you're interested, upon our next meeting, we could journey to No Man's Land and traverse its tranquil glaciers...
[When the Stars of Ingenuity Shine][Ruan Mei]: ...though I suppose it wouldn't be No Man's Land anymore... What a conundrum.

[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Mr. Screwllum, this was a premeditated attack...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Conclusion: Their target was the space station. But their strategies... are still unknown to us.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: That's right.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: Which is precisely why we need .
[Mundane Troubles][???]: The last one to lay eyes on Herta's puppet before the attack...
[Mundane Troubles][???]: ...was .
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : And you are...?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: This is Dr. Ratio of the Intelligentsia Guild — a delegate from the IPC.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio:  only just woken up — dazed.  may need...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...a few pointers.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, we cross paths again. Do you remember me? Of course, why would you? Memory is such a fickle thing, after all.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: , you must have many questions. Please be patient, Asta will explain it all to you.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: You probably know the gist of things already. A few system hours ago, one of Madam Herta's puppets was attacked by an unknown perpetrator. We don't know the location of the puppet, and we can't pinpoint its signal.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: There was no surveillance?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: No. The attack happened on a base outside the station — beyond the surveillance cameras' range.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Where is Herta right now?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: She's away on a visit. This issue didn't seem to trouble her much.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: She received an invitation from the IPC before the attack occurred.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, the Technology Department. Charming little place, isn't it? Madam Yabuli does possess some semblance of competence, but her subordinates? Oh, they're a riot — brimming with enthusiasm yet utterly devoid of intellect. It's as if evolution halted prematurely for them.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: They want to start some new collaborations with Herta and have graciously extended an invite for me to play the role of science consultant. It's delightfully amusing. I can't wait to witness firsthand how these geniuses from the so-called "Super Smart Club" squander the IPC's vast resources.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: However... this attack was timed a little too well. I can't help but wonder if someone leaked this information, and the attackers seized the opportunity. Herta's aloof response to these juvenile provocations? Almost as intriguing. What a delightful little puzzle.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: I've long heard that you're one of the best researchers in the Guild, Dr. Ratio. We are honored to have your assistance.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Save your flattery. Time is hardly a luxury we can squander. To debate the merits of mere mortals in the company of an actual genius? Quite the paradox, if you ask me.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Excuse me, , tell me — what were you doing the last time you saw that puppet?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: ...Probably running errands for Herta?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Don't play the fool. Think.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: ...Listening to Asta complain?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Huh? I—I do remember that happening... I think?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Don't play the fool. Think.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: ...Walking the dog with Arlan?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Huh? Invite me next time!
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Don't play the fool. Think.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Don't worry. We're just ticking the boxes to understand what happened. You don't really think we suspect you, right?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Reuniting under such conditions... Affirmation: Unpleasant.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A portrait of internal turmoil. You look troubled. Do you need help?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Do try to think for yourself.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Some system hours ago...
[Mundane Troubles][Herta]: ...Oh, right, I need your help with something else. That Curio's gone missing, and I can't just forget about it. Go find it for me when you have the time. I'm sure you can manage that, can't you?
[Mundane Troubles][Herta]: Let me describe it again, in case you forgot: It's an ■■■■. It's alive, but it doesn't have a body.
[Mundane Troubles][Herta]: Send me a signal when you see traces of it.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: An ■■■■?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Herta]: Anyway, keep up the good work. I need to go out for a bit. Go ask Asta if you want someone to help you.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Back to the present...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I commend your stamina for recounting that interminable tale — you must be exhausted. My ears certainly are.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: So, to sum it up, the last time you laid eyes on Herta was in her office. She sent you on a wild goose chase for some trinket, the Curio, after which you knew nothing else until Lady Asta contacted you.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If that's the narrative you're sticking to, then indulge me: Who, pray tell, can substantiate this captivating drama?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Herta?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Asta?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A second-hand account, she wasn't at the scene. Hearsay hardly counts as compelling evidence, now, does it?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Screwllum?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Apologies. Herta did not mention this to me.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Affirmation: We can ask Herta herself.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Well, if you lace up those boots and start sprinting now, you might just catch the IPC shuttle in four system hours. But as it stands, not a single soul can corroborate  story.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Mr. Ratio, your style of questioning would seem to have a preconceived bias.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Apologies, it's an unfortunate habit of mine. When one is immersed in academic research, skepticism comes far more naturally than belief.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It is also the most efficient method, judging from my experience — seeking answers with a negative hypothesis in mind is still valid research. It can still help us reach the truth.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If  is truly innocent,  can clear  name with answers.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Based on your story, you met with Herta because she specifically wanted you for an assignment.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : If you knew Herta, then you wouldn't find it weird...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Don't interrupt other people. Did no one teach you manners?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : ...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: And the assignment involves a Curio that doesn't even have a name.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : However, she did give a thorough description of the Curio. I didn't make that up.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: True. You wouldn't be able to make that up.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Herta's collection — an endless trove of trinkets and baubles — and yet she singles out one nameless, ordinary Curio? It's hard for me to imagine she would treasure one Curio so much.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Sure, but you're the one saying the Curio in question is "ordinary."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Say what you want to say.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: A correct observation, if I may add.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Recall
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : I remember now. Back then... back then...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That's enough pretending. Please be quiet.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : The Curio isn't the point. Herta was only addressing it because of its relation to the Genius Society.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I would imagine the Curio is the creation of a genius. Affirmation: It holds some special meaning to Herta.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Yes... that seems logically sound.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I doubt Herta is interested in the Curio itself.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Ask again and see what happens...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Then you said: You asked Asta for help with the lost Curio.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Yes, to get more information about the Curio.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : I didn't get a direct answer, but Asta recommended I seek out a researcher who could help.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: However, she decided to hold her tongue until now?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Mr. Ratio, it's because...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I'm asking , Lady Asta.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Your testimony went out the window the second you started being secretive.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: So what's the story? Are you full of fanciful fiction, or is Asta the one hoarding secrets like they're going out of style?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Asta isn't trying to hide anything. It's because of her position... some things shouldn't be said in the open.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: What could be more important than Herta's safety?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: ...I agreed for Mr. Ratio to become involved in this, I should consider him one of us.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: It's okay, . You can tell him.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Recall
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : I remember now. Back then... back then...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That's enough pretending. Please be quiet.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : The space station has been very distrustful of its higher management ever since the Antimatter Legion's invasion.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Another severe incident would further intensify suspicion and cause great internal strife.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Oh. So that explains why Lady Asta approved of my participation. After all, the Intelligentsia Guild's representative wouldn't be linked to the space station but would still share the IPC's position.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: They wouldn't be partial to anyone, but would still act for the space station's benefit — two birds with one stone.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Conjecture: Asta chose to stay silent.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Ask again and see what happens...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Researchers' disappearances you say... Yes, I've heard the responsibility of sorting out that mess has been thrust upon Arlan, head of the Security Department.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Yes, I ran into Arlan when looking for Adler.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Adler?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : A Level II Researcher. According to the Department of Ecology head, he knows more about Curios than anyone else. He happened to be helping Arlan investigate the disappearances.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Well, did he enlighten you?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Adler seemed to have had an idea at the time, but he never contacted me again.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Clearly, though, it bears no connection to Herta's puppet being attacked.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Recall
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : I remember now. Back then... back then...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That's enough pretending. Please be quiet.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : No. If I recall correctly, Asta said: "One of Madam Herta's puppets was attacked by an unknown perpetrator. We don't know the location of the puppet, and we can't pinpoint its signal."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : "Don't know the location..." isn't that the same as missing?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: She did say that, but then what? You need to provide evidence to show incidents are linked.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : There should be evidence. Arlan discovered something odd when he was investigating the disappearances.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : The space station's automatic fire-suppression system was momentarily activated around the time the disappearances happened. Arlan mentioned that each victim disappeared due to spontaneous combustion...
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Huh? But there are no signs of a fire anywhere in the space station...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : That's what's so odd about it — but this information has an additional layer of importance.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : This may not be direct evidence, but if the system also recorded the fire-suppression system activating when the puppet was attacked...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : ...then there's ample evidence to indicate that these two cases are linked.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Cut the act. You're perfectly aware of the point I'm making.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Defend
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Doubt me all you like. I'm just an outsider who got unexpectedly dragged into this mess.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : You and I are no different — we both stumbled into this, but you decided to assume the role of interrogator.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Oh? Your point being?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Correction: There may be a correlation.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Ask again and see what happens...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...If these two incidents were caused by the same person, then the suspicion put on you would decrease... provided that this fire-suppression record does exist in the system.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: We'll see in the main control room. Let's go... Huh? What was that?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: This is...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A declaration of war and an announcement of what's to come — they have set their sights on you. The Legion's impact remains, and the Annihilation Gang is already paying a visit. It almost seems like this space station is more suited for the Path of Destruction than Erudition.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: This "Duke Inferno," Ifrit, is a lifeform that hails from Fetora — a world long since destroyed. His race, the ever-burning fire demons, regard Nanook as their emperor and savior, but the Aeon has never cast their gaze upon them.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A group of pitiful lunatics. I like Dr. Primitive's assessment of them: "The value Nanook sees in the Annihilation Gang is perhaps far less than what one might see in a child who deliberately broke a vase."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The fire demons have a cruel temper and instinctively ignite and destroy items. Ifrit is particularly evil and cruel, even among his kin. The Ever-Flame Mansion he heads is even the archenemy of the Jepella Brotherhood, despite both groups belonging to the Annihilation Gang.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Jepella Brotherhood... I've heard that name somewhere...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: On the Stellaron Hunters' wanted posters, they stand accused of inciting the Jepella Rebellion — the uprising that caused the downfall of the Brotherhood.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The Jepella Palace crumbled in the scorching flames, and Ifrit's power has grown by the day ever since. Would you believe it to be merely a coincidence?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Something similar is about to happen here. Spontaneous combustion? For him, it's as routine as me finding fault in everything. The disappearance of researchers and the puppet were all part of the plan. And after that...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That video will soon circulate, and this station's fate? Flames, nothing but flames.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: The destruction of "trust."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I'm afraid more than trust will be destroyed here.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: We need to start acting now if you want to survive. You — come with me.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Me?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Just me?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: You have a superior strategy? Pray tell. Do we set the two of them loose, turning whispered fears into full-blown pandemonium?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: If we did that, we'd be at a disadvantage... I'll stay here and try to contain the news as best I can. Please investigate the issue quickly.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: This "Duke Inferno," Ifrit, is a lifeform that hails from Fetora — a world long since destroyed. His race, the ever-burning fire demons, regard Nanook as their emperor and savior, but the Aeon has never cast their gaze upon them.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: If we did that, we'd be at a disadvantage... I'll stay here and try to contain the news as best I can. Please investigate the issue quickly.
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: Not good... this is serious. The Security Department will do whatever we can to help you.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A list of the missing researchers and their details.
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: ...Sure, but the Security Department already combed through their backgrounds and personal relationships — we didn't find anything odd. The Annihilation Gang are a group of diehard thugs — they might be attacking indiscriminately...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A list of the missing researchers and their details.
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: O—Okay...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Take it. Remember these names — find a friend who's tuned in to the gossip around here and tell them you want to know the relationship between these people.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: What do you have in mind?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I don't know. That depends on your friend.
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: What else do you need me to do?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Take me to the one who knows the most about Curios within the Department of Ecology, if you would be so kind.
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: H—He disappeared too...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: What happened?
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: I didn't really notice at first — Adler's difficult to get a hold of at the best of times...
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: ...but it's been a few system hours, and I still can't reach him. Even the surveillance cameras can't find any trace...
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: The last time I saw him was in the master control zone. He was with Wen Shiling from the Department of Implement Arts.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Lead the way. You said Adler was on the verge of a discovery, yet couldn't confer his knowledge. Intriguing and frustrating, to say the least.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If his disappearance is also related to the case here, then maybe he really did stumble upon something important.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: :
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: I didn't really notice at first — Adler's difficult to get a hold of at the best of times...
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: ...but it's been a few system hours, and I still can't reach him. Even the surveillance cameras can't find any trace...
[Mundane Troubles][Arlan]: The last time I saw him was in the master control zone. He was with Wen Shiling from the Department of Implement Arts.
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: That jerk! Jerk, jerk, jerk!
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: Fine — disappear! I don't ever wanna see your face again!
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Who got you so upset?
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: Oh, it's you! It's Adler... Adler disappeared! *sob*
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: What did Adler do to you?
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: Adler, he... he disappeared... *sob*
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: H—He's been acting really weird recently — always researching stuff like spontaneous combustion, supernatural activities...
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: He doesn't even answer me when I speak to him. H—He was talking to himself...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: What did he talk about?
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: He kept saying the word "phrase."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Phrase...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: We'll get him back.
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: Who said I want him back!?
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: But if you want to find him... he was reading this booklet the last time I saw him.
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: I don't know exactly what he's searching for, but I hope it can help you...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Your countenance suggests tragedy.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: So the researchers who disappeared were at the forefront of challenging management. Isn't that a curious puzzle piece?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I finished browsing through this booklet while you were replying to messages. It recorded the lives of a few Genius Society members — I'd say it contains some interesting information.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It's time to go back and chat with Lady Asta and Mr. Screwllum.
[Mundane Troubles][Wen Shiling]: Adler, he... he disappeared... *sob*
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: You're back.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: I've been monitoring the Dark Web — I barely managed to stop the video from spreading. The incident hasn't grown any bigger — for now. How are things with you?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Less than promising, or to use a different phrase — we're in deep trouble.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: We're running out of time, let's retrace our steps and evaluate the situation. From the data we've collected, there are three avenues we can explore...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: First, Adler's disappearance. He must have come across some vital information.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Discussion
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Adler also...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: You think that Adler's discovery drew the enemy's attention.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Indeed. And I already know what he found.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The next angle is what the victims have in common — distasteful as that discussion may be.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Discussion
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Distasteful discussion?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A mere glance at their background would indicate they share no commonalities.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: However, after browsing through their online records,  discovered they all wield influence on the space station's Dark Web.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Lady Asta must know what this means.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: ...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Last, is the abilities of Duke Inferno and the secret of spontaneous human combustion.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Discussion
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio:  probably already knows about this.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The fire demon of Fetora, the Duke of the Annihilation Gang... There is another secret with Ifrit.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Present Evidence
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : I understand. So the answer is... is...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Tenuous connections. Enough of this nonsense.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: During prior unrest instigated by the Ever-Flame Mansion, some testified to seeing "miscreants materialize from the inferno."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The flickering tongues of Duke Inferno's fire carry a certain property, and this property... is the secret behind spontaneous human combustion.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Look — the answer is right there.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: The link between the three is...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Ask again and see what happens...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: This booklet describes a kind of fire that can phase through dimensions, claiming it "burns through worlds, leaving numerous scions of flame behind".
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Discussion
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: It's the Phase Flame, the creation of member #29, Sserkal. She was an amazing genius. Intelligent, kind, and humble.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: However, she lived for a mere 29 days on the human calendar. Such a pity.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: The Phase Flame shifted into a different phase as soon as it was created. When it returned to this phase, Sserkal had already passed away. It then continued to shift through phases, making its capture impossible.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The kindling of this unique flame... must be the missing Curio that Herta's been searching for. And Duke Inferno is evidently spawned from it.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Discussion
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Somebody was once able to glimpse the traces of the Phase Flame, and obtained a wisp of its kindling. Herta kept it and lent it to Ruan Mei for her research, but the kindling was lost in the process.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: If Ifrit is a scion of the Phase Flame, then the entire incident is now clear as day.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I fear that is the truth Adler discovered.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Discussion
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Undoubtedly, the Curio Herta asked  to find was the Phase Flame.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: And Adler already discovered the relationship between spontaneous human combustion and the Phase Flame through the concept of "energy lifeforms."
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Present Evidence
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : I understand. So the answer is... is...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Tenuous connections. Enough of this nonsense.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Wen Shiling said Adler kept muttering about a "phrase" before he disappeared.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It probably should have been "Phase." He saw member #29 Sserkal's research topic in this booklet and verified his hypothesis.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: As a scion of the Phase Flame, Duke Inferno would naturally share similar capabilities. Full-on phase shifting may be a bit too ambitious for him, but teleportation? That's likely more his speed.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That is the truth of the spontaneous human combustion — the researchers didn't disappear — they were "moved."
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: 
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Ask again and see what happens...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: We don't know where the victims went, but Duke Inferno's plan is now clear.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: And the sudden and consecutive disappearances provided the best environment for chaos to fester.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Once the seed of unrest has sprouted, he will then send out an announcement for an imminent attack. It will push the crisis from the dark into the light, catalyzing it into new growth and bloom.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The next step would be to ignite the spark. Look at those researchers who disappeared — what would happen if someone realized their similarities? I need to say no more.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: It was all a premeditated trap to stir up chaos on the space station!
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...We're running out of time.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Th—This...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: ...No. It isn't enough.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Indeed. It needs one more spark.
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: What do you mean?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If you limit your involvement to this, there's still room for excuses. If it were me...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...I wouldn't give you the chance.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Could it be...?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: What is it?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: Huh?
[Mundane Troubles][Asta]: F—F—Fiiiiiiiire!
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: : Asta!
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Stay calm. Asta was merely teleported — her life was not in danger.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Based on firsthand experience, I have ascertained that Ifrit's flame is simply a splinter of the primordial Phase Flame — lacking any phase-shift ability. Logic: Asta is still within the confines of the space station.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: What do we do now?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That flame must still be somewhere inside the station. Find it, and we'll find a way to bring her back.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: Hahaha... a splinter, you say? The arrogance of the gifted is charming, in its own way.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: Try then, if you must.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It seems that Duke Inferno didn't deign to personally grace the space station. He merely cast infernal fire into our midst to wreak havoc among the researchers. When the fire fizzles out, his malevolent plans will vanish without a trace.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I will head to Herta's office and activate the folded space in the Curio storage room. With some changes to its parameters, I can use it to block the fire's teleportation routes and seal it inside the station.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Mr. Ratio, please go with   and contain the fire.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The infernal fire is also a form of energy lifeform. The imaging device will pick up its trace. Follow it.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I will head to Herta's office and activate the folded space in the Curio storage room. With some changes to its parameters, I can use it to block the fire's teleportation routes and seal it inside the station.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Mr. Ratio, please go with   and contain the fire.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The infernal fire is also a form of energy lifeform. The imaging device will pick up its trace. Follow it.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The way is awash with flames! It must have just teleported!
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Be careful — get ready to dash into the fire.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: The spatial coordinates have shifted...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: See, it's still in the space station. Like Screwllum said, it cannot escape from here.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Do you know what to do with cornered prey? Hunt it to the death.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: The fire is dying... This place is... strange...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It's still resisting. The fold in the space has shifted. I can deduce its escape route with a mere glance.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: Human... why? This has nothing to do with you...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The flame is getting weaker. Duke Inferno can't maintain it anymore.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: What... is your goal...?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Seems like this chase is about to end.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It's over.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: Ignorant fools blindly chasing the firelight — not knowing that the blessings of Destruction already lie at their feet.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: It is little wonder that even the descent of the savior's Legion was unable to cleanse this place. I will acknowledge my brashness... for now.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: But next time, expect no intermediaries. I will come to personally offer you the demise of your sins with infernal fire.
[Mundane Troubles][???]: ...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The small fragment of consciousness in there is gone. Duke Inferno has discarded this fire...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...Oh? No. Hold on...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, the banal theatrics of stalling. Let's not, shall we?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: So this is the extent of "miscreants materializing from the inferno"? Seems like Dr. Primitive wasn't wrong.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The fire is weakening, it's preparing to flee. You — keep your eye out for Lady Asta's whereabouts.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Good work. You did very well.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: How is Asta?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Rest assured, Asta only had a fright. She is recovering in the Clinic.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: While you were chasing the enemy, the Security Department also found the missing researchers. Affirmation: They are all safe and sound.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: How did you find them?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: It was all thanks to Adler.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: They fell into a spatial Curio and could not leave until the Department of Ecology's most knowledgeable Curio expert solved it from within.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Many of them were shaken by their experience when Arlan found them, but they are otherwise fine.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Is it over?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Yes. It is over.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Why do I feel like you didn't do much...?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: This business is over, and I believe the space station will be able to deal with any internal aftershocks. In Herta's stead, I thank for your efforts, .
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: But there is one mystery that remains unsolved...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Haha, and that is something I must deal with myself.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I've been waiting.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Fallout from this incident remains. Surely you have plenty of pressing matters to attend to? Or is the safety of the space station beneath your concern?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Answer: That is exactly why I came. After all, the principal figure in this whole affair... is right here.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Haha... When did you start to doubt me?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: "When one is immersed in academic research, skepticism comes far more naturally than belief."
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I've had the same bad habit as you since the beginning, Mr. Ratio.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I must say, I'm quite honored, Mr. Screwllum, but do explain — why opt for silent wisdom when you already had the pieces of the puzzle?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: For curiosity's sake. Affirmation: I made the same decision as you. To accompany and observe.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Oh... and when did you become convinced?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Objectively speaking, aside from some minor spiritual trauma, no researchers were hurt in this attack... which never aligned with the Annihilation Gang's modus operandi.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: Logic: A third party saved them.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Had I not fortuitously acquired a spark of the Phase Flame and intervened in Duke Inferno's teleportation, those people would already be space waste — floating past the windows here.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: You are more candid than I calculated.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: But still behaving within your calculations, no?
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: One last question. Screwllum, genius though you are, can you deduce why I did this?
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I cannot be sure. I can only hypothesize. Helping the weak hints at the merciful instinct of a medical doctor, but maintaining a cool, detached observation reveals the strictness of a scholar...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: ...and pulling the strings from behind the curtain is akin to laying down the gauntlet to a genius.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The ruler of Planet Screwllum is indeed well-versed in the human mind. It's a pity you are as much in the ivory tower as other geniuses — you still got one thing wrong.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: To stand aside and observe is the best treatment one can give. There is a disease called "foolishness" that is harder to cure than any ailment.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The Path of Erudition has neither reason nor logic. While geniuses wander among the stars, the ordinary can't even trace their footsteps. Those less gifted have no choice but to walk alone, enduring a lifetime of tumbles and triumphs...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...but even a life marked by failure is a life worth living — it is only in moments of solitude and despair, when help is absent, that fools grasp how to pick themselves up.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I have a fastidious nature — I cannot stand fools, idiots, or imbeciles. Seeing them fills me with dread. Regrettably, this space station is just like the Intelligentsia Guild — devoid of geniuses and filled with mediocrity.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: You wish to uproot the researchers' blind worship of geniuses.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I am only laying out my questions. As for the answers... They'll find them themselves.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Pursuit tinged with negativity is still pursuit, and it is capable of leading us to the right conclusion. For the masses of the mediocre to reach a level of awareness — this is a necessary rite of passage.
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: You are indeed more like a "medical doctor" than a scholar.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: As for the spark I leave behind...
[Mundane Troubles][Screwllum]: I believe Asta will deal with it properly.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It is also a lesson I left for her.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: With that, I take my leave. I look forward to future encounters with such brilliant minds. Let's hope they're as memorable as those we had today.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A farce, full of trivial concerns.
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ultimately, they're just...
[Mundane Troubles][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...mediocre minds.

[Memory Backtrack][Asta]: ...After the Legion's invasion, the space station has been under constant scrutiny. Physical damage can be easily repaired, but it takes a long time to heal the wounds in people's hearts.
[Memory Backtrack][Asta]: Some researchers have been questioning the management and security of the space station ever since the invasion.
[Memory Backtrack][Asta]: Things had settled down a bit with the reconstruction efforts, but the researchers' disappearances have rattled them again.
[Memory Backtrack][Narration]: Researchers' disappearances?
[Memory Backtrack][Asta]: Yes. Four researchers have inexplicably disappeared in a matter of days. No exit logs, no traces — vanished.
[Memory Backtrack][Asta]: People were just starting to regain their footing after the catastrophe. I didn't want panic to spread, so I suppressed the reports and told the Security Department to investigate in secret.
[Memory Backtrack][Asta]: However, as you can see, it's hard to keep secrets in a sardine can like this.

[Memory Backtrack][Arlan]: ...I'll be honest with you — it's been tough. The surveillance didn't capture anything regarding the researchers' disappearance.
[Memory Backtrack][Arlan]: There's only one clue. Adler observed that the automatic fire-suppression system was momentarily activated around the time the disappearances occurred.
[Memory Backtrack][Arlan]: That means that every victim's disappearance was accompanied by some inexplicable fire. When we made visits to the scenes, some of the witness testimonies seemed to agree with this...

[Memory Backtrack][Herta]: Anyway, keep up the good work. I need to go out for a bit. Go ask Asta if you want someone to help you.
[Memory Backtrack][Narration]: Memory Sorting
[Memory Backtrack][Narration]: Herta assigned me to find a certain lost Curio, which is a kind of energy lifeform related to the Genius Society. It seems that I may need Asta's help.I found Asta, but she didn't seem to know much about it either. Fortunately, Hinkel of the Department of Ecology and Emily of the Department of Insight are nearby, which is more or less a clue.Hinkel is troubled by the confidence crisis within the space station, and Asta must be under considerable pressure. We had a brief chat, and she speculated that what Herta is looking for might be Wubbaboos, but this conclusion may be inaccurate. In the end, Hinkel suggested that I look for Adler. Apparently, he is the person who knows the most about Curios in the Department of Ecology.In addition to Hinkel from the Department of Ecology, I also asked Emily from the Department of Insight for clues about the missing Curio. She told me that apparently there are similar lifeforms in the Xianzhou Alliance.The issue of the confidence crisis Hinkel mentioned concerned me a little. Asta and I chatted about this topic, and I unexpectedly learned that there had been a series of researcher disappearances on the space station recently.I ran into Arlan on my way to find Adler. He seemed to be looking for Adler too, so I decided to go with him.Adler was saved by us when he was attacked. I explained what my intentions were, and he said that the Wubbaboos suspected by Hinkel of the Department of Ecology and the heliobus that Emily of the Department of Insight heard about were both energy lifeforms, which gave him some kind of revelation.Arlan was secretly investigating something. After saving Adler, I tried to get to the bottom of things, but he seemed to be hiding something. I did some poking around, and sure enough, he was investigating the disappeared researchers that Asta mentioned before. With Adler's help, he discovered that every disappearance was accompanied by an instance of spontaneous human combustion.Herta assigned me to investigate energy lifeforms similar to Wubbaboos and heliobi. The spontaneous human combustion occurring among the researchers is also a thorny problem. But Adler already seemed to have a bold conjecture. His intuition was very accurate, and it seemed that he was looking forward to something.

[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: :
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Pom-Pom's not here yet?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Pom-Pom knows how to keep people on the edge of their seats.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: *ahem* Apologies for the delay, dear passengers. Something important came up, so I, the conductor, had to spend some time preparing!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: So... what came up?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Yeah! What was so important?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: It's rare for the conductor to make an announcement.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Yeah! What was so important?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Are we switching routes again?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Huh? But I only just finished packing my bags!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: I thought everyone knew! Our next destination is the Planet of Festivities, Penacony.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: I know everyone's eager to disembark and get to that famous stellar hotel, but before we set off, I should remind everyone of three things.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: First: Penacony is located in Asdana, a star system brimming with memoria, which has historically been one of the Macro Voids that leaked out from the Memory Zone. Even after eons, the memoria concentration up ahead is above normal levels.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Usually, this wouldn't be a huge problem... but everyone's different, so if you exhibit any signs of dizziness, hallucination, distorted memories or any other symptoms, you should take them seriously!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Second: Penacony is a colony belonging to the Harmony Family — it also marks the first time this Family has extended a public invitation to other factions. Please remember that the Express has been invited as a guest, and that we must adhere to any and all regulations.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Got it! When in Rome, as they say! Don't worry, Conductor, we definitely won't embarrass the Nameless.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Rome? Anyway... Third and final: Rather than being a request... Pom-Pom has a favor to ask of everyone.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: If you could, I hope that while you're all on vacation, you could spare some time to help inquire about a few of the Nameless.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: What Nameless?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Are we getting new crew mates?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Allow me to explain.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Just like most of the worlds that the Express calls at, Penacony is one of the stops along the silver tracks. Several millennia ago, it was an IPC frontier prison, and it was the Trailblaze that connected it to thousands of stars.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: During that time, the Astral Express once visited Penacony. As with all meetings, they inevitably lead to goodbyes. As the Express's logs indicate, it seems some passengers decided to call Penacony their permanent home.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Is this a rare happening?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Who could be this important?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: It's been so long. Will we still be able to find them?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Don't worry, just think of it as returning to your hometown. Following the Express's departure, the Stellarons cut off contact to myriad worlds, and Penacony's ownership switched hands several times.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Why did these Nameless choose to stay here? How did the course of their subsequent lives unfold, and what legacies did they leave behind? Retracing our predecessors' footsteps, that is in itself an adventure, wouldn't you agree?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Even if they left the stars behind them, their Trailblaze would not be over. That's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: According to the passenger list, the three people who got off were Tiernan, Legwork, and Razalina — the Express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. No supplementary details are available.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Just names and occupations? And they don't even sound like their real names either... This will be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: We'll just leave it to the stars of fate. Considering the Nameless' diversity... Perhaps we might even stumble upon their descendants, or, against the slimmest of chances, the very individuals themselves.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: We'll conclude today's navigation meeting on this point. There's a bit of time left before we jump. In the meantime, might be a good idea to double-check your bags.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: I'll broadcast an announcement before we jump!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: :
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Investigate
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: Welcome to the Interastral Peace Broadcast. Good evening everyone.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: Good evening.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: Welcome to a new episode of Interastral Peace Broadcast. We are here to bring you the latest news from across the galaxy.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: The IPC and the Xianzhou Alliance have renewed their trade agreement, bringing great economic benefits to both parties.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: The head of the Armed Archaeologists of the Intelligentsia Guild, Allen Jones, personally oversaw the excavation of the ancient tomb of Emperor Rubert I. The ruins rank as a Category Omega site on the Potential Disaster Index.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: Renowned songstress, Robin, has received an invitation to perform at Penacony's Charmony Festival.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: The Garden of Recollection has gathered memoria fragments from the lost world of Moonshield — the precious memories of this world will not be forgotten.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: Let's take a closer look at the details.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: Regarding the IPC and the Xianzhou Alliance: The Xianzhou Luofu has opted to renew the trade agreement.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: The agreement will help to open up markets and promote cooperation between the two sides in agriculture, industry, medicine, and culture, laying a solid foundation for a free, open, and prosperous business environment.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: At the signing of the agreement, friendly talks were held between Madam Yukong, Sky-Faring Helm Master of the Luofu, and a representative of the IPC's Marketing Development Department. The two sides reached a consensus on various issues, including the impact of interstellar security on the free market.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: The IPC also expressed their heartfelt concern for the Luofu regarding the recent invasion by the Antimatter Legion and sent their condolences to the victims.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: The IPC strongly condemns the barbaric atrocities committed by the Antimatter Legion and conveys the Amber Lord's wish for Preservation to all worlds ravaged by that wretched force.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: Emperor Rubert I left many horrific relics across the universe, and one of them, the Mechanical Emperor Tomb, has captivated the interests of countless people since its discovery.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: The excavation of the tomb is headed by the head of the Armed Archaeologists of the Intelligentsia Guild, Allen Drake One-Armed Jones, with assistance from Genius Society member, Screwllum. It is hoped that the excavation of this metallic relic, which holds a Category Omega ranking on the Potential Disaster Index, will finally shed a light on its mysterious nature.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: According to records of the Emperor's deeds left behind by the Inorganic Legion, the original purpose of the site was to "house the inventions inspired by the imagination of Rubert I."
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: A spokesperson for the Intelligentsia Guild said, "We have no way of knowing what amazing discoveries Jones will uncover, but we are hopeful that his findings will further our understanding of the Emperor and help save the universe from the horrors that he will bring with him when he returns."
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: The Interastral Peace Broadcast will be covering this story throughout the excavation.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: Penacony, the Planet of Festivities, announced that it will invite renowned singer, Robin, to perform at the Charmony Festival.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: Once every Amber-Era, countless followers of the Harmony will attend this long-held tradition of the Planet of Festivities, and together pray for a brighter and better future for the universe.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: Robin is a superstar whose voice is known throughout the cosmos. She has been the recipient of many top awards.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: It is believed that during the celebrations, Robin will sing a hymn for the Aeon of the Harmony in the name of The Family.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: The IPC will broadcast the entire event, sending the sounds of music and good wishes to worlds far and wide.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: As we all know, the Garden of Recollection has always been committed to the restoration of lost civilizations, igniting the spark of revival across the cosmos.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: According to reliable sources, thanks to the efforts of the Memokeepers, all memoria fragments of the deadworld of Moonshield have been salvaged.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: Moonshield was destroyed during an invasion by the Antimatter Legion, but with the combined efforts of the IPC and the Garden of Remembrance, the collection of information about the fallen world was recently declared a success. The Memokeepers plan for it to be reborn in the pristine land of the Remembrance.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: The Destruction can destroy any material thing, but it can never take away our hope. The IPC will provide whatever support and protection within its means for the long-term development of all civilizations across the universe — including those that have perished.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Male Voice]: And this is the end of our broadcast. Please tune in for our next episode. Thank you for listening.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Female Voice]: Thank you.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: , you're the picture of calm as always. Meanwhile, March 7th's buzzing around like a kid on a sugar rush.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: I'm excited, too!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: I trust Penacony won't let you all down.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Of course, I'm the mature, adult-type.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: A punchline with a straight face — I suppose that's your specialty.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: But, regarding The Family's invitation, I do have some details that I wish to discuss with everyone... just not now. Let's enjoy our vacation for now.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Himeko]: Let's enjoy ourselves first. Of course, let's not forget Pom-Pom's request either.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Welt]: How's it going, ? All packed and ready?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Welt]: There probably won't be any surprises happening on Family territory, which is a bit of a shame if you ask me. But hey, it's rare that we can take a break and let loose. Let's enjoy it.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Mr. Yang, you look relaxed.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Welt]: Well, adventures are exhilarating, but rest and recuperation is equally important.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Mr. Yang, you seem disappointed.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Welt]: Of course not! Adventures are exhilarating, but rest and recuperation is equally important.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Welt]: Rest and recuperation aside, don't forget Pom-Pom's request. The conductor has done plenty for us, and it's time to return that favor.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Welt]: Rest and recuperation aside, don't forget Pom-Pom's request. The conductor has done plenty for us, and it's time to return that favor.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: I spoke to Mr. Yang. I'll be staying on the Express this time. I wish you all a delightful time in Penacony.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: You're not coming?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: Thank you, I appreciate the invitation, but I don't like bustling places, and someone has to handle the work on the Express.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: You should come with us, it's such a rare opportunity...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: Thank you, I appreciate the invitation, but I don't like bustling places, and someone has to handle the work on the Express.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: I respect your decision. Rest well.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: Thank you, . It's reassuring to know we're on a similar wavelength.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: Pay no mind to the matters concerning the Xianzhou. Penacony isn't the final stop on our trip. We have plenty of time. Once everything is packed up, I will naturally catch up with all of you.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: I'd advise double-checking your bags. Word is that The Family's customs procedure can be quite demanding. Better to sort it out now than face issues at your hotel check-in.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Dan Heng]: I'd advise double-checking your bags. Word is that The Family's customs procedure can be quite demanding. Better to sort it out now than face issues at your hotel check-in.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Camera, check. Extra clothes, check. Toiletries...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: ...Ahh, drat! The travel bottles I ordered haven't arrived. Although, I hear that Penacony's resort hotel is pretty luxurious. I'm guessing their toiletries should be just as fancy.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: That means I can make more room in my suitcase. What else should I bring...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Take some food.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Good idea! A vacation without munching on-the-go? Unheard of! Mm, but since time-off is a rarity, I'm kinda leaning towards savoring the local dishes...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Take your Pom-Pom toy.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: My Pom-Pom toy... not a bad idea! That's kinda like bringing the conductor on vacay with me. Ah, but I think it's too big to stuff in the case...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Take me.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: You won't fit in the suitcase! Can't you walk?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Maybe I should bring some novels or comic books? At least then I won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. But these books are so heavy...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Oooh this is hard! What else should I take...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Oooh this is hard! What else should I take...
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: :
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem, hi, hello~ Attention all passengers.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express is about to make the jump — The Express is about to make the jump — Please be seated and hold on!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The train is about to make the jump!

[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: , you're up? How's your prep going? Welt and Himeko beat us to the punch, but I stuck around for you. Let's get going.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Mm... Shall we go meet up with them now?
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: I'm ready to go.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: Penacony, the Planet of Festivities, the universe's biggest and fanciest amusement park awaits!
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][Narration]: Hold on a moment.
[Long Day's Journey Into Night][March 7th]: You left something behind? Hurry up and go get it, I'll wait here for you!

[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Not another one...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: ...Come with me.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Who are you?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: What is this place?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Where are we going?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: These questions... have no meaning. But, I will answer you as best as I can: This is the border between reality and the Memory Zone, a... dreamscape.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Right this moment, you and I have coincidentally shared the same dreamscape, and appeared in each other's minds. This is the Land of Dreams's inaugural welcome for us.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Worry not, for very quickly, you will awaken from this dream, forget everything that has transpired, with naught but a faint lingering of loss.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Pay no mind, for this forgetfulness happens with each new dawn. It is an occurrence that we have become accustomed to for so long.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: ...So, come with me. I'll take you home.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Left, to the end of the corridor. I will wait there for you.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: I'm not there. Turn back.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Galaxy Ranger, Acheron... This is what they call me. You can call me whatever you want.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Step DescriptionAcheron leads you to a door. Is this the dreamscape exit? A Strange Dream
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Open this door... Take a look at the mesmerizing dreamscape, while you can still remember.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Step DescriptionThe warrior calls herself "Acheron," a Galaxy Ranger.Continue to follow in her footsteps and leave this strange dream. A Strange Dream
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: :
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: This way.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: After you.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: :
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: :
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: 
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: :
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: 
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: We're almost there. Can you still walk?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Now I Am Become Trailblaze, the Perambulator of Walls.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: You're funny. If you can crack jokes, you're probably fine.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I feel a bit faint...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Don't panic, this is normal.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Don't stop, don't turn back, don't look down. Or up, for that matter.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: These voices... They are just shadows of the dreamscape. Pay no heed to them.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Silver Wolf]: How do you intend to pull them off the stage?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: All we have to do is present the truth, and they will naturally reciprocate.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: The Charmony Festival's stage belongs only to you, little sister.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: But if I can't sing... what meaning does a stage have?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: [Note 1]
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, the charming audacity! To think that you, of all people, might emerge victorious, dear gambler.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Three chips are enough. All or nothing.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: [Note 2]
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Memokeeper... Do you think you can just leave?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: I'm sorry. The dance partner of my choice... I've already chosen.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: ...We're here.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][???]: Welcome to the Reverie! May you experience an unforgettable holiday! If you need help checking in, please head straight to the concierge...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Leave this realm, and rise as you would on any other day. Forget this fortuitous encounter, and return whence you came.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: But before you do, I would make a request of you.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: You may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but I wish to know...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: ...Have we met somewhere before?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Perhaps we have.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Probably not.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I don't know.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: What do you mean?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: What's going on...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: You evoke memories of an old friend. In the haze of my recollections,  with me,[Note 3]much like this surreal dreamscape where we stood close, yet forever out of reach.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: May I ask you a few more questions? I... tend to forget things — which is why, rather than memories, I'm accustomed to using my emotions to capture what I normally wouldn't otherwise. The answer is inconsequential. Your spontaneous reaction is what matters.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: For instance, when you awaken in your room, your lips speak several names. Are they your companions? Family? Enemies? You seem to have forged unbreakable bonds with many people and many incidents...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Might I ask if you fear losing these bonds?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I cannot bear such a fear.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: If it means losing them, I would.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: If it means that I will disappear, I would.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I feel no fear.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I don't know.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Mm... Then, if there was a vast dreamscape, so lifelike it's indistinguishable from reality. There, no one faces life's separations or deaths. Everyone attains their deserved happiness and lives joyfully ever after.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: I would ask: Would you wish to stay?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I would, no matter the cost.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: If I didn't have to pay any price, I would.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: That depends on the price I'd have to pay.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I would never want to live in a dream.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I don't know.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Now... imagine if this splendid dream were fated to fall apart: Friends, family, strangers, followed by the gentle breeze, soaring birds, the stars... and ultimately, yourself.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Everyone, and every face they remember, the joy and the heartaches, the vows sealed and those left hanging... all will inevitably march towards a predetermined ending. If you had grasped the journey's finale right from its inception...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: I would ask: Would you still embark on this journey?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I would abandon it — the price is too dear.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I would abandon it — I have already tasted the beauty of dreams.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I would abandon it — Trailblazing was never my intent.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I would blaze a trail without hesitation.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I don't know.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: I know this is hard, you don't have to be hard-pressed to make a decision. As I have said... the answer is inconsequential.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: Hearing, touch, thought — through these, you gain emotions — cherish them. With emotions, we make choices. And so we return to the original question...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: I would ask... Do you still remember me?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I seem to remember you from somewhere...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: No, this is the first time we've met.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: ...I understand.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: How interesting. For a split second, it felt like countless versions of you, alike yet distinct, gave entirely different responses.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: That was my final question, thank you. We all have our paths to walk, so we shall bid our farewells.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Will we meet again?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: You haven't told me how to leave this place...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: The golden dream is getting restless. In the coming long night, I'm afraid you will face many tribulations and witness many tragedies. And finally... your sight will only see black and white.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: But please believe me that in that monochrome world, there will be a glimpse of fleeting red, and when you make a choice, it will reappear before you once more...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: What you must do now is ponder its significance.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: And then...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: You can return to the waking world.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Acheron]: That's where we all find our answers.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Pom-Pom: , what's wrong? Wh—Why are you crying all of a sudden?
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I may have dreamed of a tragic future...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I may have dreamed of an old friend...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I dreamed of a riddler spouting strange talk...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: I dreamed I was slashed by someone with a blade...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...S—Sounds like you had a nightmare! We just arrived in Asdana and already... You should be careful, it seems your tolerance to memoria isn't the strongest.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Don't fret, dreams are often the reverse of reality. While you were sleeping, the Express arrived at Penacony...
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Can you imagine? Yesterday's grim frontier prison is today's lavish hotel. I wish I could wander Penacony's streets today, but I'm pretty train-tied at the moment. You'll have to be my eyes and ears while we're here.
[The Knocking at Ungodly Hours][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Gear up and make sure you've got everything! And before you step out, swing by the back and grab March, she's waiting for you there.

[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: We're here at last! The Family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. Our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: I wouldn't have put it past them to try and nab that Stellaron from inside you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Thankfully, they didn't.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: The Stellaron is stable.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Aside from that, I have to say The Family has been really accommodating...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Well, the hassle was worth it — just look at this grand hotel lobby! And those endless rows, they're all rooms, right? Just think of the number of guests staying here.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Where are our rooms? Come on, Mr. Yang and the rest must be at the front desk. Let's hurry up and meet them there!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: Welcome to the Reverie! May you experience an unforgettable holiday! If you need help checking in, please head straight to the concierge.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: It's the child from the dream...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Do you work at this hotel?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: I am Misha, a bell boy, working here on Penacony. Pleased to be at your service. If you need help with your baggage...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: , over here, something's not right...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: ...Should you need assistance with moving your luggage to your room, feel free to contact me. Please go ahead, don't keep your friend waiting.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Welcome to the Reverie! May you have an unforgettable holiday! Should you need assistance with moving your luggage to your room, feel free to contact me.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I hear this hotel is pretty unique.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Yeah, it is! The Reverie does not only provide accommodation for its guests, it is also connected to both Penacony's reality and dreamscape. Guests from all over the cosmos come here to immerse themselves in a marvelous, dreamy journey.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Aren't dreams fake?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: A good question! Maybe not all dreams are false... Well, at least the ones in Penacony aren't. Or perhaps should I say they are... another reality.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Won't I get tired out from all that dreaming?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: The hotel's Dreampool provides a comfortable dream experience, so don't you worry about that!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: How is it working here?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Er... Are you asking me? Hmm... It's not too bad. Many guests come and go, and I get to hear all about their adventures.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I see, got it.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You'll know what I mean when you enter a dream. Penacony will not disappoint!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: So Penacony is...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Yes! This hotel is Penacony in real life. And the Penacony in the dream... is a place where miracles are born. A land of lavish joy, a grand banquet where the curtains never fall!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Mm... It's hard to describe its magnificence in words. In any case, you will surely be awed!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I hear The Family held a grand event.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You are well-informed indeed! It is an opportunity provided by The Family, and a tradition on the Planet of Festivities.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Everyone gathers in the hall, reveling in merriment, pursuing opportunities, staking all they have on one desperate gamble, and finally, their dreams become reality!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I have nothing else to ask.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: May you have a pleasant stay in Penacony!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? We've just arrived and there's already drama?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: I'm sorry, but your name really isn't in the system...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: But in the information I received from the Astral Express, it states that we already reserved rooms. Please check again for me.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: Yes ma'am, please give me a moment...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: The Astral Express, four platinum guest rooms... whose names include Mr. Welt Yang, Miss Himeko, Miss March 7th, and...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: ...Mr. Dan Heng. These are the only four names on the reservation list.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Something wrong?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Yes, your name isn't on the hotel's reservation list...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What's going on?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: We've run into some trouble. Your name isn't on the hotel's reservation list...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: And yes, I'm Mr. Dan Heng, reporting for duty.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Dan Heng...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: ...I understand. No wonder 's name here is missing. When we responded to The Family's invitation,  hadn't even arrived on the Express.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Something came up in Dan Heng's schedule, and he couldn't make it. I have an idea — could you reassign his room? It's still the same number of people.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: a new passenger aboard our Astral Express. We can vouch for  status.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: I— even if that is so, I'm afraid...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: No, I'm not doubting your status, it's just...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: It's just that right now, we're on the eve of the Charmony Festival, Penacony's most important moment of every era. And with The Family's invite, all guests from all over the cosmos have thronged this place...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: Hotel security is on high alert, with zero room for error. And with such a last minute change, it really isn't something that this young lady's words can resolve on a whim. My esteemed guests from the Astral Express, please do not make it harder for her.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: We're sorry for all the trouble our check-in seems to have caused. Might I ask for your name?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I am the humble Aventurine of the IPC's Strategic Investment Department, a Non-Performing Asset Liquidation Specialist and subordinate to supervisor Diamond. I was cordially invited by the Watchmaker...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I also happen to be a traveler that's had to stand behind you for quite a while.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: ...Leave it to me.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: I've heard that the IPC has also received Penacony's invitation, so forgive me if I'm mistaken, but you must be the representative. The IPC's elite certainly does have an extraordinary air about them. I suppose such an exceptional figure such as yourself wouldn't mind paving a convenience for us?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I must be hearing things: Paving a convenience? Shouldn't I be saying this to you instead?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I've been waiting here for more than ten minutes. Do you know how many credits ten minutes is worth to me?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: It must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, Mr. Aventurine, I have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: The IPC's influence runs deep and wide, and their word wields the utmost authority. We hope to borrow your status to vouch for .
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: As such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Well, this is interesting. And how will my new friends benefit me?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Now this is a topic very much worth getting into. Just as we are guests of the Watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in Penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Sounds good. But Ms. Navigator, I must point out that—
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: If I do something about it now, the time saved is from my own effort, not a favor from you all.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...But what you said in the second half, I loved it! Friends, yes — nothing is more precious than friends, especially a righteous Trailblazer like a Nameless.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Going forward on this Penacony trip, I'll be counting on all my "Trailblazer" friends here. Looking forward to a delightful time with you all.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: I'm glad you've put it this way. So about the vouching...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: There you go, Miss. Please allow  to check in on my account.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I have an appointment with The Family's Mr. Sunday. I will ask him to handle this matter later. Don't worry, I won't cause you any trouble.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: Um, but...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: Alley, just a moment.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: The Family cannot allow guests to enter a dream while bearing burdens.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Speak of the devil, look who's here! It's Sunday, the most handsome man in Penacony! Along with the singer renowned across the universe: Robin!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: He said you were the most dashing person in Penacony, how interesting.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: I've kept you waiting, Mr. Aventurine. This way please, let us speak in private.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Astral Express guests, please come this way and rest your feet.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Wait, what!? You're...!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Hello, friend. How have you been? I sincerely hope you don't mind.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I do mind.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: My apologies for any perceived slight. To show my sincerity, I offer you 10,000 credits as a gesture of goodwill.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: That's better.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: What're friends without friction! Now we're truly acquainted.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You have no idea what friends are.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Such integrity, I like it! I must have you as a friend — here, 20,000 credits!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: It's fine, I don't mind it.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: My apologies for any perceived slight. To show my sincerity, I offer you 10,000 credits as a gesture of goodwill.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Then I'll gladly accept it.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: That's the spirit! Nothing should come between friends. Tell me whatever you need, it's on my tab.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Thank you, but we can spare the gifts.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: How upright, I like you! I must have you as a friend — here, 20,000 credits!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Please excuse me, I have some matters to attend to, so I must depart, but I'm sure we'll meet again soon.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Wait a minute, I'm sorry, but are you... the...?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: The singer, Epsilon's superstar... If I Can Stop One Heart From Breaking. That's your song, isn't it?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: I never thought a cutie like yourself would be a fan of mine.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Ahh, it really is Robin! To run into her in person here...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: It is an honor to meet everyone.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Are you also a member of The Family on Penacony like him?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Truth be told, I am a guest like everyone. Penacony is my hometown, but I left when I was older. I was graciously invited this time to return and sing a song at the Charmony Festival.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: The person you speak of is Sunday, my senior, and one of the local leaders of Penacony. He is also the organizer of this era's Charmony Festival. He heard you all ran into some difficulties, and sent me here to provide aid.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Alas, I arrived a little later than usual. I sincerely apologize for any unpleasantness during your stay.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Please be at ease, I have instructed Miss Alley to resolve the system error as soon as possible. I have also upgraded your rooms as token compensation. Please wait a moment for the hotel to arrange for suitable accommodation.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Mr. Aventurine has an appointment with the Oak Family, and has checked in prior. On his behalf, I extend his apologies to everyone of the Astral Express, and wish for an amicable partnership moving forward.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Thank you for stepping in to resolve this matter, but are you sure about the rooms? I wouldn't want your other guests to feel we were being given preferential treatment...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Please rest assured that The Family will personally undertake communications to handle this. It is only right that we — as the actual administrators — relieve you of any problems during your visit in Penacony.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: I apologize for taking up everyone's precious time, and we shan't keep you any longer. If you need anything else while in Penacony, The Family stands ready to serve.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: May your dreams be beautiful and pleasant.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: *sigh* It's just one surprise after another. But since that mister... which day was he? Sunday. Since Mr. Sunday has vouched for us, I guess we can finally check in normally?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I'm already a little winded.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: You and me both! I can't wait to get inside and just flop and roll on that comfy bed...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: You'll have to wait for us to finish checking in first.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I hope we don't run into any more trouble.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: How does the saying go? "Trouble comes in pairs"...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: There's also the saying: "From misfortune comes bliss."
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Are all The Family names so strange?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: This is just a stage name... I guess?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: I thought so too. It's most likely some rule of Penacony's, or The Family's.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. Let's go find Miss Alley...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: Esteemed guests of the Astral Express, your check-in procedure is complete. Please forgive us for any previous inconvenience caused.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: This is your Dreamscape Pass: It serves as your hotel room key, as well as a directory of all the amenities and information you require at The Reverie. It even provides smart assistance.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: At the same time, it is also Penacony's special one-of-a-kind souvenir that belongs only to you!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: You can use the Dreamscape Pass's provided clock-in feature to record every moment of your wonderful dream, save your favorite happy bits, and create a Dreamscape Scrapbook that is uniquely yours.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: Regarding the method of usage, the Dreamscape Pass will guide you through the process.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Alley]: I wish you all pleasant dreams in Penacony. You may take the elevator over there to reach your guest rooms.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Alright! Let's move out!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: A dream world... I heard that Penacony transformed the dreamscape into a majestic metropolis...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: What exactly would that look like? I can't wait!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Our rooms are down this way.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: This is a long hallway... Is it just me, or is this hotel too big for its own good?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: We're finally here. Let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Welt, how about a drink first? Penacony's SoulGlad is very famous.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: ...Go on. We may be thinking of the same thing.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Do you remember the invite that the Express received?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: "The Family's esteemed guests are cordially invited to Penacony to participate in our grand celebration." That's why we're here in the first place.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: You recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: "...Witness the impossible in the realm of dreams, find the Legacy of the Watchmaker, Father of Penacony, and thus the answer to the question: Why does life slumber."
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: I don't remember that part of the invite... You mean, there was a hidden message?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: This is the part that intrigues me — the invite sent by The Family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: But the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual... The music it played had off-key notes in the background.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: I recorded these dissonant notes, and they were a perfect match with the gravity wave frequency when the Express made its warp jump. Also, the Express engine's spatial curvature was its encryption key.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: ...A distress call method regularly used by the Nameless.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: I can't be certain. It may be a Masked Fool's trap. From the execution itself, the Riddlers or Inquisition Spirits could have done this themselves.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: When did you discover this?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: When we were handling that Luofu Stellaron matter. I told Pom-Pom about it first thing.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: It's no wonder that IPC ambassador also mentioned this "Watchmaker." The invite he received must also have contained a hidden message, and it seems like he decoded it.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: ...There's something else on my mind. When the invite was brought up, that Family leader mentioned being one of the "actual administrators" of Penacony, and that it was their duty to "relieve" us of any problems.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: In hindsight, there was more to that statement. He also had Miss Robin with him... I'm no singer, but her voice sounded a little strange... Would a singer really take to the stage if their voice wasn't in top shape?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Are you saying... you suspect that The Family did not send the invite, and... is hiding something from us?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: It's possible. The fact that The Family sent out invites to the other factions is already unusual. And your discovery confirms that there could be a third party involved... I take back what I said: This "event" is becoming more interesting with each passing second.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Why didn't you tell the others?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: We shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of Penacony or The Family.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: But you said so yourself: This could concern the Trailblaze.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Well, I did, which is why...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: ...before we set off, I told March 7th and Dan Heng about this.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: So I was the only one kept in the dark then.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I too just found out about the invite thingy...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: That's because you were zonked out the whole ride. No one had the chance to tell you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Time to get involved.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Ain't no biggie when Galactic Baseballer is in the house!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Penacony's situation is getting complicated. Let's tread lightly.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Who sent the invite, what is the purpose of gathering all the factions into Penacony, and why does The Family choose to remain silent about their knowledge of this... There are too many unanswered questions. We must use the utmost caution before we go deeper.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Right now, let's just focus on the conductor's request: We'll collect intel while enjoying this "wonderful vacation." Penacony is, after all, a famed resort of the cosmos. Not many get a chance to even visit in their lifetime.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: The decor in here's a little... loud for my tastes. So this is how astral high society does things, huh...?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About the Watchmaker...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: They say he's a historically important figure in Penacony, and tales of his life have been handed down over generations. Such tales encourage believers to come to the Planet of Festivities to pursue their dreams. He's an interesting fellow, that's for sure, and his legacy still has the power to draw people in.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: But how and why he's involved with that invite, and why his name popped up in the encrypted message allegedly sent by a Nameless... I've got no leads for now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About The Family...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: The Family believes in the Harmony, and their altruism is well-known across the stars — a trait that is intimately tied to Penacony's stability and prosperity.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: But some factions have always been wary of The Family — suspecting that their benevolence and eloquence belie an ulterior motive... So far, it seems to me that The Family treats their guests with courtesy, so I don't think we need to worry about that for now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About the dream journey...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: The dream Penacony is divided into twelve moments. Personally, I'm interested in the Moment of Sol — it's a visual dreamscape steeped in Penacony's history and civilization.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Penacony's Grand Museum, the Primal Waking Library, the Paperfold academy... The pasts that we chase may be stored in these places.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: That's enough chit-chat for now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Welt]: Past the guest room's Dreampool is the real Penacony. Let's get ready to move out. Pleasant dreams.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: What's wrong? Not turning in? Can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About the Watchmaker...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: One can't discuss the Planet of Festivities without mentioning the Watchmaker — Penacony's household name and figure. Fortune, fame, status... He built everyone's futures with his bare hands, and became the symbol of dreams.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: But the veracity of these stories... remains untraceable. Many have their own opinions on the Watchmaker's origin and past, and there are even some who suspect he is a conceptual construct of The Family.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: For now, I do not think this invite is linked to the Watchmaker. His legacy... It sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About that IPC representative...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: An IPC ambassador who knows more than he lets on, a silver-tongued businessman, a flamboyant and debonair aristocrat... He could be all of them. My instincts tell me he's much more than meets the eye.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: Before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About the dream journey...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: The dream Penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. I've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: As for me... I look forward to the Moment of Scorchsand — its wild winds, taverns, and festive choices have more of a Nameless Trailblaze vibe. The Moment of Morning Dew is also a decent choice — I can use that chance to visit The Family.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: That's enough chit-chat for now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Himeko]: You must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. Even if you're Trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Woah! What a big bathtub...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Can't sleep from all the excitement, huh? I can't wait to experience the dream world!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Where are you thinking of going?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: The Moment of Dusk, obviously! How can you not visit the shopping paradise when you're at the resort of all resorts! I'm all ready to fill my bags to the brim!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Hmm... After doing my shopping, I'll get all dolled up in an evening gown to attend Miss Robin's show at Penacony Grand Theater!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About Robin...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: You know, it's weird. Welt noticed it too, about how Miss Robin's voice sounded somewhat weary... I can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Could she be tired out from her Cosmic Concert Tour? Insisting on performing under such circumstances, Miss Robin is a superstar among celebrities!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: About the event...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Here I was, thinking of some good ol' relaxation, but nope! This "event" is a wild ride! The various factions deciphering the riddle, a power struggle of past legacies — feels like we're in a live-action detective saga!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Who knows, maybe we'll even witness classic scenarios like family feuds, tragic losses, worlds torn apart, espionage situations, rivers running red with blood, stuff like that! This is simply too thrilling...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You've got quite the active imagination.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: That sounds scary.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I too wanna see a river of blood!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Just kidding, how could that be possible?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: That's enough chit-chat for now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][March 7th]: Don't worry, Welt and Himeko will have our backs if things go wrong. Let's just make the most of it all while we're here.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: How fortuitous, we meet again.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: This is my room. What are you doing here?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Is this your room...?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: We meet again, friend!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: That's right, pal!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Calm down, I'm just here to soak in the festive vibe. This may be your room now, but half a system hour ago, it was still mine.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: A lucky block number, a lucky floor, a lucky room number. You have no idea how much I went through to book this precious space... And now I've given it to you. Treasure it well, friend.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You were the one who transferred it to me?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Of course. What, you thought The Family acted simply out of their own good will?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You were the one who arranged the check-in?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: No no, I only let you have my room.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Well, it doesn't matter. You need to leave.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I'm not sure I like that tone...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Penacony's a true-blue land of dreams. How many across the stars would spend half their lives, just to acquire an admission ticket into The Reverie?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Think about the type of people who can even afford to stay here. If it wasn't for my brilliant plan, you think The Family would offend those bigwigs, just to sate the paltry whims of an unsought guest such as yourself?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: So sit down, and let's have a chat. With everything said and done, I think I deserve at least this much, right?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What do you want to talk about?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Cutting to the chase, I like that.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You should go talk to Himeko or Welt.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Wrong. You're the one I seek.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Simply put, my friend, I need your help. You may or may not know this, but Penacony's far murkier than it seems. The Family's eyes are everywhere, but you get the drift.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: My goal is simple: Help the IPC retrieve some things that belonged to them in the first place. If you agree, when this is done, you will stand to reap great rewards, as well as the Preservation's protection.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: It's clear you're not just one of the crowd. You possess a distinct quality, so magnetic that it could sway the outcome of any game. That *power*, you really don't wish to use it? Or... you don't want to be rid of it? Why not use it to etch your name across the stars?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: The power that men both fear and desire is right in the palms of your hands...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ... Stellaron, have I hit the nail on the head?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: How did you know?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I know now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Your acting's good, I like that.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I'm warning you, you need to leave now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Warning me! Hahaha, you're too funny.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: You don't have to answer me now. Sit on it for a while. When the time is right, I will look for you again.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Of course, you can confer with your colleagues as well, or go as far as to use me in turn — I welcome that notion. Because it will also show me your true value.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I don't do deals where I'm on the losing end. So, I hope that "friends"... don't let me down.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I will think about it.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Mm, very well.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I cannot make this decision on my own.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I already said there's no rush to give me an answer. Because no matter what happens... the outcome will remain the same.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You should really be going.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I already said there's no rush to give me an answer. Because no matter what happens... the outcome will remain the same.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Oh yes, before I go, let's play another game — a simple game, to get to know each other better. You just have to guess which hand the chip is hiding in. It'll help you get a better grasp on my personality, and the way I do things...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Ding— A chip is tossed into the air, and in the blink of an eye, it disappears, replaced by two clenched fists held out in front of you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Left or right? Get ready, I'm about to reveal the answer.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Oh, I didn't get your answer. But that's fine, because...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Friend, the game has already begun.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Allow me to make you an offer —
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...one you can't refuse.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: No reason to choose otherwise...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...and no other choice.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Hello there.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: What are you doing in my room?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Your room?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Well played, friend. You haven't been in Penacony long, but you already know how to rope people in to your cause.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Don't misunderstand, that was a mere reminder. This place runs deep, with plenty of unsavory characters. Don't forget to stay on your toes. Like... keeping your door closed.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I'll make my exit now, ! Have a pleasant stay.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Thank you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You are...?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Have we met somewhere...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...Why haven't you left?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: ...Eh?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: I said, why haven't you left?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: This is my room.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: This is my room.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Why haven't you left?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Why do I have to?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...Have I come to the wrong room? This can't be. Before I said anything, I even made sure that I had the right room number...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Do I have the wrong wing... or even the wrong block? I'm sorry, this hotel is huge, and the hallways all look the same. It's easy to get lost in here...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: I jest. Take it easy, this is indeed your room. I was just passing by...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: I'm trying to find my own room too, and I heard a commotion here... so I came to take a look. Luckily your door was open, or it could've gotten dangerous. That man looked like he was up to no good.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: I was just teasing, please forgive me. This is indeed your room. I saw that man snooping about while I was in the hallway, it didn't seem like he was searching for his own room, so it made me wary...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: I later saw you walking into the same room, so I began to connect the dots. The situation got a bit tense... I hope you don't mind that I pulled this stunt.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Anyway, as long as you're all right. I should return to my room too.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: But before I go, can I ask you a question? You may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but I wish to know...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...Have we met somewhere before?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I was about to ask too...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Woah, déjà vu...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Perhaps in a dream...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Probably not.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...Is that so? I haven't been able to shake off this familiar feeling since just now... Maybe this is what they call déjà vu, hehe. Or it could purely be serendipity.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: This may sound embarrassing, because I would sometimes forget stuff I really shouldn't have from past experiences... It's just a habit of mine, don't mind me.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...Yes, it was a dream. I had a dream on my way here, and I think you were in it... A blink of a thought in my head...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: , this is your name, isn't it? Pleased to meet you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: How do you know?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Do you still remember me?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I'm that famous now?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: *smiles* You forget, that man mentioned it before he left. My memory's not very good, but it's not so bad that I can't remember details from just minutes ago.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Galaxy Ranger, Acheron... This is what they call me. You can call me whatever you want. We will likely meet again.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Lastly, a gentle reminder... There are people who possess unwavering resolution and faith, even unto death, and they do not wield such conviction for good. And on that man's face, I see such a similar expression.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: One who wears a blade must use it to cut eventually. And when a gambler has nothing to lose on the table, he will surely go for broke and bet it all on a final hand... That is all I can say.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: I thought you should know all this before making a choice. Goodbye.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Why're you back?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Is there something else?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: It didn't take long for a reunion.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Mmm...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Acheron]: Sorry, can you point me in the direction of the lobby? All these hallways really look the same to me...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: ...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You show Acheron the way, she thanks you again and again.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: )
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Please relax. Feel the ebb and flow of your body...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Just focus on breathing, and imagine you're in paradise...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Imagine... a dream land.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: Mikhail...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: Come back...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][???]: Mikhail...!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: What is it, Ratio? Why the long face... Hey, I just realized, where's that handsome bust of yours?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: You're late, by four minutes and sixteen seconds. You'd better have solved the mystery of Akivili's fall. Otherwise, I'd suggest not tangling with the Nameless.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: You mean you don't believe me when I say I truly wish to befriend them?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Clamorous people do not make friends. Fun fact: The Attini Peacock boasts one of the universe's more jarring songs, and your choice of attire is somewhat peacock-esque.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...It seems this peacock is short of a feather or two. The Family's been rummaging through your things, haven't they?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Yeah, by that gray-suited fellow. All the cash gifts, and the box containing the Cornerstones... Eh? Where're you going?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Back home, to tell the corporation that some idiot ruined everything.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: It's nothing more than a few rocks, why so serious? Who cares if they're gone?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Without that aventurine stone, you're nothing more than a doomed Sigonian thrall sentenced to die by the IPC. Or is that serial number on your neck a cherished memento from the Amber Lord?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Hah, you're funny, I'll give you that! It appears our erudite friend has done his homework.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It's my job. How would a gambler wrest Penacony back for the IPC otherwise?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Don't worry, Doctor, I have my ways. The Family fears interference from the IPC, hence their constant intervention... Or, to play devil's advocate, perhaps Penacony might have always been a ruse under the guise of "the Harmony?"
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: If you ask me, that invite is nothing but a self-planted diversion, a red herring. Or maybe they're thinking of pulling off something big during the Charmony Festival...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Or someone else made the invite, and they acquiesced to elevating the magnitude of the plan. Regardless — be it The Family or the Watchmaker's Legacy, as long as they're all useful to me.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Get to the point. What's your plan?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: No need to expand on that now. It's not yet time to reveal my trump card.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Damned gambler. Any true collaboration demands trust. Did that notion somehow escape your Sigonian upbringing?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Then, do you trust me?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That depends on you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: So you don't trust me either. Now that was easy, wasn't it? Also, I didn't go to school, and my parents didn't teach me any of that. A pity, they left before they could impart any life lessons.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...I did not mean to offend.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: I'm not offended. But they did teach me that friends are weapons of the Avgins. Even under the watchful eye of the Harmony, we need as many friends as we can get.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: Let's see, the Garden of Recollection and the Astral Express have already made contact. The Annihilation Gang... I can't really count on them. The Knights of Beauty haven't given their answer, and as for that bunch at the Tavern...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Speaking of which, I ran into a woman just now who introduced herself as a Galaxy Ranger. The whole conversation felt off. Help me look into her...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...Huh?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Aventurine]: ...You don't really disdain me that much, do you? Well, seems like I'm on my own again.

[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Ah, you're here! Wonderful!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Oh, I... I thought you wouldn't notice me...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Welcome to the Gallery of Thoughts! You can think of this as the entrance to the Golden Hour. I'm here to provide guidance to our guests.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: We meet again.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Huh, you remember me? I'm so glad.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: This whole place looks weird.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: This is a temporary interchange, so it looks a little rundown... The Reverie in the dreamscape is currently undergoing a revamp.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: I apologize for any unpleasantness in your stay... but if you enter the Golden Hour, I'm sure all your troubles will dissipate in an instant!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What happened to The Reverie?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You're asking about The Reverie in the dreamscape, right? I'm not sure exactly either, I'm sorry...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What is "Golden Hour?"
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You've perhaps read about it in your Dreamscape Pass, but I can explain one more time!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Golden Hour is one of the twelve dreamscapes in Penacony, and its time coincides with midnight. Here, the dream's time is forever stuck in the moment before midnight. Tomorrow will not come, and this night of revelry will never end...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: ...Ah, but that doesn't mean that time has stopped in the dream. To avoid any physical or mental burden on guests, time in the dream has been synced with reality's, so don't worry!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I just picked up a note...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Note? Did you find it in the room?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Ah... It wasn't trash left behind by the previous guest, was it...?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: It was my mistake — I failed to tidy up properly, and caused an inconvenience for you... I'm truly sorry!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: How do I get to Golden Hour?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You just go right through that door to reach Golden Hour. I wish you an unforgettable dream!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Right through that doorway is Golden Hour. If you've any other questions, I'm more than happy to answer them!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What happened to The Reverie?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You're asking about The Reverie in the dreamscape, right? I'm not sure exactly either, I'm sorry...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What is "Golden Hour?"
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: You've perhaps read about it in your Dreamscape Pass, but I can explain one more time!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: Golden Hour is one of the twelve dreamscapes in Penacony, and its time coincides with midnight. Here, the dream's time is forever stuck in the moment before midnight. Tomorrow will not come, and this night of revelry will never end...

[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I've nothing else to ask, thank you.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Misha]: I wish you unforgettable dreams in Penacony!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: :
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: ! Are you alright?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: The fall didn't hurt at all!
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Hehe, well you are in the Dreamscape, after all.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: I think I'm hallucinating...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Hehe, that's a normal reaction for first-time visitors to the Dreamscape.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Are we in Heaven... Or?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Haha, there's nothing to worry about — you've arrived at the Dreamscape.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Seems like our guest here hasn't gotten used to the transition. Fret not, feeling a sense of weightlessness is normal for new visitors.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Robin, please guide our friend in getting more comfortable with the new environment.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Leave it to me.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Robin gives a slight nod to her brother, then locks her emerald gaze with yours. She smiles, and you see ripples shimmering in the depths of her lake-green eyes, followed by a mighty vortex emerging from the depths of the pool.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Your vision dims as your body dissolves, becoming one with the fluidity of the time-space. You resonate with and become attuned to the serene fusion of frequencies. Your heart drums, leading this symphony.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Don't worry, just relax. You'll be feeling like your normal self in no time.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: The choir starts. "Inhale." They sing. "Now Exhale." They chant. Instinct compels, and the stagnant fluid in your chest begins to flow again.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: A gentle warmth emanates from within, saturating every inch of your being. Your melodies slow down, fade away, like a lullaby. A seven-colored illusion delicately caresses the top of your head and closes your eyes, its movements tender and compassionate. You feel contentment and drift into a deep slumber.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: You open your eyes and feel a vitality like no other. The difficulty you were experiencing a moment earlier feels like a distant memory.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: You should be feeling fully in control now. , welcome to Penacony.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What does that mean? What did you just do to me?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: I've merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Did you just brainwash me...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: I've merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: What was that sound just now...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: It was a song with a harmonic tune.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Relax. Just did some tuning on you with the resonance of the Harmony to allow you to control your limbs freely in the Dreamscape.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Essentially, the dream of Penacony is a world formed by memoria. Only by fully understanding its nature can you move freely within it.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: It's like learning to swim — it's easy to sink at first when you aren't accustomed to the water, but once you get the hang of it you can float and swim on the surface effortlessly.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: That's a great analogy. I get it now.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Thanks for the compliment. In fact, we don't really have an in-depth understanding of the memoria.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: This is deep...
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Indeed. But still, we don't really have an in-depth understanding of the memoria.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Narration]: Does that mean I can levitate in the air?
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Theoretically, you can, but it would be very difficult to pull off. After all, we don't really have an in-depth understanding of the memoria yet.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Unless you're one of the Memokeepers of the Garden of Recollection, it can be difficult at first to manipulate the memoria as you wish. But once you've been tuned by the Harmony, you can use the same laws of physics from the real world to understand how the dream world works.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Sunday]: Oops... I've fallen into my professional habits again. I just can't seem to shake off this urge to be a know-it-all.
[The Youths Who Chase Dreams][Robin]: Don't mind him — he's always like that. Please enjoy the beautiful dreamscape The Family has built for everyone. We shall take our leave. Have a blast!

[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Do you plead guilty to this ?
[Sleepless Night][Akivili?]: ...Yes, I plead guilty.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You sneaked into the Hyai'i Zoo and splurged half an Amber Era's crew budget on 250 Nosewalker cubs. You kept them in the restroom, where they were left to breed and multiply uncontrollably, causing other carriages to be filled with sewage...

[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Do you plead guilty to this ?
[Sleepless Night][Akivili?]: ...Yes, I plead guilty.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You barged into the kitchen of the dining carriage, claiming that the whole area needed disinfection. This resulted in the loss of 42 Crispy Crumbly Pom-Pom Pies. And because you also took the last serving of the Express Special in the fridge, I was left starving...
[Sleepless Night][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Sleepless Night 4.mp4
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Do you plead guilty to this charge?
[Sleepless Night][Akivili?]: The first one is clearly a result of your own doing... But I do admit to consuming the last serving of the Express Special.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem. Don't get carried away just yet. This is only the beginning of your list of culinary offenses!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Pom-Pom: There are cases of entire entries disappearing from the Express data bank, the plants in the Parlor Car being watered with SoulGlad, disrupting the conductor's rest with noise, and a break-in to the conductor's exclusive snack vault.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: What do all these have to do with Akivili?

[Sleepless Night][Narration]: It's quite fascinating...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: What do all these have to do with Akivili?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: That's it?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Haha, this dream bubble aligns with what you desire in your subconscious! If you're interested in experiencing the dream bubble again, you can purchase it with credits...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: I almost expected something like this...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: So that "first dream bubble for free" was just a sales pitch, huh?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Dr. Edward: This dream bubble is indeed pricey. Still, please give it some consideration!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Well, are you going to buy it?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: I'll buy it.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Thank you. Hope to see you next time!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: No way. It's too expensive.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Dr. Edward: What a shame. Please come again!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Oh, right! As this is your first time using the dream bubble, here's a sticker for you! You can use it to decorate your Dreamscape Pass and commemorate your unique trip to Penacony!

[Sleepless Night][???]: She went that way. Get her!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: :
[Sleepless Night][???]: Don't even think about running away, you stowaway!
[Sleepless Night][???]: S—Sorry for bothering you! Please, I need your help...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: How can I help?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: What happened? Who are you?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: I'll do my best to protect a pretty young lady!
[Sleepless Night][???]: Hey, look! She has an accomplice!
[Sleepless Night][???]: Good work! Now we can nab them both in one go!
[Sleepless Night][???]: That's enough, boys.
[Sleepless Night][???]: S—Sir?
[Sleepless Night][???]: What's gotten into you all? Open your eyes and take a good look. Is this lady the stowaway we're looking for?
[Sleepless Night][???]: Eh? Who... Who's this?
[Sleepless Night][???]: Don't you know him? Look at his brown hair and gray vest. He's the officer sent here by The Family to maintain order at the Charmony Festival.
[Sleepless Night][???]: I—I see... Sir, the thing is, we're trying to apprehend a stowaway, and that young lady there looks very suspicious. We're sure she's the one!
[Sleepless Night][???]: That's nonsense. Take another look, will you? The witness report says that the suspect is a lad with silver hair, and you guys are going after a girl with silver hair. Does that even make sense? She's our guest!
[Sleepless Night][???]: Well, just get out of my way and I'll take care of this.
[Sleepless Night][???]: Yes, sir!
[Sleepless Night][???]: Sorry for all the trouble you went through back there.
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: I'm Gallagher from the Bloodhound Family, and those idiots are some young Bloodhounds I've been training.
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: Because of their youth and inexperience, they mistook an honored guest of Penacony for a criminal... This is indeed a regrettable mistake. I'd like to offer my sincerest apology to you on behalf of the Bloodhound Family.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: What about the stowaway?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Who's the silver-haired guy?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Who are the Bloodhound Family?
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: The Bloodhound Family are the guards of the Dreamscape. We're in charge of the security here, and our duties include arresting people who try to enter our world illegally.
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: We got a tip that some criminals were planning to take advantage of the festivities around the Charmony Festival to sneak into Penacony. Now that the festival is just around the corner, there are likely many shady characters lurking around...
[Sleepless Night][???]: ...
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: Don't worry. I believe this is just a misunderstanding. How could such a lovely girl like you be a stowaway?
[Sleepless Night][???]: ...Thanks. Without your kind help, I wouldn't know what to do.
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: Just part of the job.
[Sleepless Night][Gallagher]: I need to get going. If you need help, you can reach out to me through the young Bloodhounds in this area. I wish you an enjoyable experience in this land of dreams.
[Sleepless Night][???]: I owe you a big one! If it hadn't been for you, I might have been... taken away by them.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: I'm happy to help.
[Sleepless Night][???]: Thank you so much!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Well, my help doesn't come free...
[Sleepless Night][???]: I... I understand. It's only right to return the favors I receive!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Galactic Baseballer, at your service!
[Sleepless Night][???]: You're funny.
[Sleepless Night][???]: By the way, I've just noticed... You're a Nameless, right? Is this your first time here on Penacony?
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: How do you know?
[Sleepless Night][???]: You have the Astral Express badge on you. I saw it on the big screen once!
[Sleepless Night][???]: I also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. Did The Family invite you here? I—I'd be happy to show you around!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Are the Nameless really that famous?
[Sleepless Night][???]: You bet! The Interastral Peace Broadcast recently did a whole segment about your glorious achievements!
[Sleepless Night][???]: I also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. Did The Family invite you here? I—I'd be happy to show you around!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: I'm not doing autographs today...
[Sleepless Night][???]: That's not what I meant. Though I do admire the Nameless...
[Sleepless Night][???]: The Family invited you here, right? I—I'd be happy to show you around!
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: Although the Bloodhounds mistook me for a stowaway, I'm actually a local. My name is Firefly, and I'm from the Iris Family. I work as a stage performer, although right now I'm just an extra...
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: When there are no acting gigs, I work as a guide near Glaux Avenue. If you don't mind, I can show you all the exciting things around here! Maybe if I do my job as a guide, people will stop suspecting me...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: That's awesome! I happen to need a tour guide.
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: Glad to hear that. After all, you just did me a huge favor!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Don't you have work today?
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: I'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to Penacony don't need tour guides anyway... They're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Well, you have a job now.
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: Thanks. Let's go!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Looks like life on the Planet of Festivities can be pretty tough...
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: No, it's not like that! Penacony is where people realize their dreams. There's always a festive atmosphere here! It's just that things can get a little crazy with the Charmony Festival drawing near...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: I'm counting on you for a good tour then.
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: Glad to hear that. After all, you just did me a huge favor!
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: Are you a Family member?
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: Me? No, I'm not one of them — not yet. I merely work for them...
[Sleepless Night][Narration]: You notice her lowering her lashes and looking around, paying close attention to the crowd, as if something is hiding in it. But she quickly collects herself and returns her eyes to you.
[Sleepless Night][Firefly]: ...We can talk about that another time! Right now, I wanna give you a tour of the town... Here we go!

[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Over here!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: :
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: The first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the Dreamscape is the Oti Mall! The Dreamscape Sales Store here is super famous.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: There are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars... As long as you have enough Alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Items purchased in the Dreamscape can also be brought into reality through an extra service. Unfortunately, the transfer of automobiles to the real world is not available at the moment... You can come back for them next time.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Just outside the mall is the plaza. Follow me! I'll buy you a nice meal!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: We're here. Hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "In a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Well, you can find all kinds of local delicacies here — Clockie Pizza, Oak Cake Rolls, Alfalfa Salad, and the classic SoulGlad! Feel free to pick anything you like! Today it's my treat!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Thanks. That's very nice of you!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Hee-hee, you're welcome.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: You shouldn't have!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: No worries. You can buy me a meal next time!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I should warn you, I do have very expensive tastes...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Th—That shouldn't be a problem. I have some savings left...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: This is Penacony's most iconic dish.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Take your pick. It's my treat~
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Um, this is...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...Are you done ordering? You... you have great taste! Haha... I... I'll get the bill...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Hmm...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Now... let's go this way...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Are you done ordering? Then I'll pay up.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I love their Oak Cake Rolls! I get one from here every day!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Doesn't that get expensive?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Well, that's why I only have one per day...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Aren't those high in calories?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I—I won't put on any weight since this is all a dream...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Let's walk while we eat. It's time to head to the next stop!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: This is the luxury store I told about you earlier.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: If we keep going, we'll reach Glaux Avenue, which is the road to Golden Hour.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Over here! Follow me.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Please come this way. Let me show you something interesting.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Look! That's the statue of Clockie, Penacony's famous cartoon character!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: It's the oldest and most famous animation from Penacony. It follows the adventurous life of Clockie and his friends in the town of Dreamville. To date, over 10,000 episodes have aired!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: He looks cute.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I know, right? Isn't he adorable?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: His character design is a little... surrealist.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Um... I guess it's because the animation has a retro style.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Isn't having a clock as a character a bit... ominous?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Ominous? Clockie is a household name here. There would never be anything ominous about him... right?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: By the way, do you know that Clockie's design is said to be inspired by none other than the legendary Watchmaker?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Watchmaker?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Is he famous?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I can't believe you haven't heard of him. He was a legendary tycoon in the history of Penacony — the founder of the Dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: There are different stories out there about the Watchmaker's origin. Some said he was a traveling merchant from beyond the sky, some claimed that he was exiled to Penacony as a prisoner... Some speculate that he wasn't even a real person, just a symbol...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: The true story is anyone's guess, but everyone aspires to emulate his success and be the next Watchmaker!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: As his inspiring story became known across the cosmos, those with a dream flocked to Penacony in droves. They held feast after feast, eventually building the Planet of Festivities we have today. Everyone in Penacony knows this name.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: The cartoon character Clockie is portrayed as reckless and full of hot air, but I believe the real Watchmaker was a Nameless! After all, creating the Dreamscape sounds like just the kind of thing a Trailblazer would do.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...Hold on... If the Watchmaker really was a Nameless, wouldn't that make him your predecessor? Would you like to take a picture with him?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Thanks.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: My pleasure! Here, give me your phone.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I think I'll pass. I'm allergic to camera lenses...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I see... Let's go somewhere else then.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Aha, I know how this goes. You're gonna charge me a lot just for taking the pic, aren't you?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Of course not! What were you thinking?
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: Help! Help me!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: You hear a pitiful cry for help. The cry is...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: ...coming from the Clockie's eyelashes.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Eh, what's that? It looks like there's something on Clockie's face.
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: Help! Help me! Pull me out! Help me!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: The eyelashes are begging to be pulled out — which feels a little too much like a dream.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: You want a photo with him? Sure! Please give me your phone. I'll take it for you!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: It's done! It came out great — you're very photogenic.
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: Help! Help me! Pull me out! Please!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: You took a nice pic with Clockie.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: But the eyelashes are still begging for help.
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Thank... you, beautiful person!
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: I'll... repay your kindness! Go to... the tree! Please go... there! There! I'll show... you something... nice!
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: *Tweet*
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: After letting out an adorable chirp, the bird flies away.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Before it left, it seems to have offered some kind of "reward." The main thing is that you need to go to "the tree" first.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Perhaps... you can meet with it again there. See just what exactly the "nice" thing is.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Is there something wrong with Clockie's statue? Why did you suddenly jump just now?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I rescued a bird — a bird with sharp edges and points.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: A bird with sharp edges and points... Umm, I don't think I saw it.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I pulled out his eyelashes.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Eyelashes? Clockie doesn't have those...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I can actually jump in this world!? Color me surprised!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Really? You jumped just now — it was really sudden, too.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Well... If you're okay, let's move on to the next stop, which is just a stone's throw away from here. Please follow me...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Can you see that building in the distance? That's the famous Grand Theater, another great landmark of Penacony!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Has a pretty unique shape, doesn't he? In the real world, it was originally the central prison of Asdana. The Family renovated it in the Dreamscape and transformed it into the glorious Penacony Grand Theater.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Since the moment it was built, the Grand Theater has graced the entire Dreamscape with its rendition of the Odes of Harmony.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: During the once-in-an-era Charmony Festival, Family members will gather at the theater to welcome the Harmonious Choir that blesses Penacony with everlasting peace.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: And here we are! The best viewing spot in all of Golden Hour! Look, there's even a telescope here! When the Charmony Festival arrives, remember to be here early if you wanna get a seat.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Step DescriptionFirefly continues to lead you through the various tourist hotspots in the area — Penacony's SoulGlad-themed rest area Aideen Park is just ahead. Follow her! Golden Hour
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Next, I'll bring you somewhere you can really have fun.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: That place up ahead is Aideen Park — everything here is themed around SoulGlad. It's a little crowded, so make sure you stay close to me.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: This is the largest park in Golden Hour — it represents the soda culture of Penacony. That gigantic soda bottle houses the headquarters of the SoulGlad Enterprise!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: SoulGlad is said to have originated from a sweet medicinal syrup popular during the Prison Era. Invented by a man named Sousa, it was thus called the Sousa Juice. Aideen, an interstellar traveling merchant, saw the potential in the beverage and purchased the formula.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Aideen then carbonated the beverage and renamed it "SoulGlad." He also pioneered the school of thought known as "Syrupism," in which he promoted the consumption of SoulGlad as a new kind of lifestyle. And just like that, he created a commercial miracle.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Did you know? One of the ingredients in the original recipe for Sousa Juice, known as Dreamleaf, has gone extinct. That means the only place you can get a taste of Epochal SoulGlad is in Penacony's Dreamscape.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: This is also the only place where one can fully experience the core values of Syrupism...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: She abruptly freezes. In that fleeting moment, you notice a cautious shift in the girl's gaze, piercing directly into your brow, or perhaps somewhere behind you...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: What's up?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: What are you looking at?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Firefly returns to her warm and gentle disposition.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...Time waits for no one! Let me show you around!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Step DescriptionFirefly continues to lead you through the various tourist hotspots in the area — You have arrived at Aideen Park. Take a wander around with her. Golden Hour
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: See these musical instruments playing themselves with no human performers? That's the Sweet Dreams Troupe.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: In Penacony, many objects and facilities have gained self-awareness due to the influence of the memoria. After being tamed by The Family, some of them formed the Sweet Dreams Troupe to provide entertainment for guests.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Be careful, though — sometimes these animated objects can be affected by dangerous emotions or memories and transform into the destructive Dreamjolt Troupe... If you ever run into them, go ask the security guards nearby for help.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Hey, there's a ride attendant over there!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Let me get some Aideen Tokens for you. With those, you'll be able to try any of the attractions here that you fancy.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Hi, there. This is my friend's first visit to Penacony. May I get some Aideen Tokens for ?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Admin]: Of course. Please show me your Dreamscape Pass.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Admin]: Name— ... Here's your Dreamscape Pass and tokens — be sure to keep a good hold of them! Have a good time!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: How many tokens are there?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Admin]: Ten. You may now enjoy the attractions in Penacony to the fullest.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Thanks! , let's try out some of the games nearby. Our goal is to use all the tokens!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Let's live it to the fullest!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Let's do it!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: That's a lot of pressure...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Not at all! You're going to lose — I mean — spend all of them in no time once you start playing! Just try it and you'll see!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Let me see which one we should try first...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Since this is your first time here, I say we start with the easiest games. The Dreamy Slots and Lucky Wheel are pretty straightforward.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Wow! You won something on your first attempt! Impressive!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Holy moly, it's the grand prize... Today must be your lucky day!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: You keep playing. I'll go and get some drinks.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: :
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: :
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: What do you say? Ready to call it a day?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I'm a bit tired too. Let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Did you have fun, ?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Penacony's Golden Hour is pretty amazing, isn't it?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: It's nice. Everywhere is just magical.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I know, right? It's a dream that's loving and forgiving to everyone, just like The Family.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: You sound a bit sad...?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I'm not sad. It's just that... this dream is so loving and forgiving.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: It's alright. I've seen better places on other worlds.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I'm not surprised to hear that from a Nameless. If you ask me, I'd say it was the unity of The Family that brought this dream into existence — and the dream has become just as loving and forgiving as The Family.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: It's vast and deep like an ocean. Even the humblest people can find solace here.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...I really appreciate your help earlier today — that's why I took the chance to introduce this beautiful place to you. It was willing to accept me, even though I didn't belong here. I've grown very fond of this place, and that makes me want to... share it with others.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Aren't you a local?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I am... At least for now...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: You shouldn't attach your feelings to stuff like this.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: You're right... But when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Are you... really a stowaway?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I... I'm a lawful resident... at least now I am...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: , could you come closer? Closer, please. I have a question for you...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...Did you travel here alone?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: My friends went to the other Dreamscapes.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Oh, I see...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I am. At least for now.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I see...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: It depends on what you want to do.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but I took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...someone's been following you.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Don't turn around. I'm certain that you're his target. He's been on our tail since we parted ways with Mr. Gallagher.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: I wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: He's about 5 feet 11 inches tall, give or take. Judging from his strong build, it's clear that he's well-trained. He walks in long strides, but his steps are light and barely audible. That way of walking doesn't leave footprints...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...He looks like a skilled fighter, the covert kind. He has large palms, yet his fingers are slender and nimble. I reckon he has experience using knives, like a short sword or dagger...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Do you know anybody like that? A maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Ah... He's coming our way!
[Tales from the Golden Age][???]: Hey, well if it isn't my most loyal customer, ?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: It's been such a long time, old friend!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: What a coincidence to run into you here! Oh, my! I'm in luck today!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Sampo!?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Yes, it's none other than your old friend, Sampo!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: What brings you here?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: I can't be dreaming, can I...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: You're such a hoot, buddy. This is Penacony, of course you're in a dream!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: You're surprised to see me? You know, it's thanks to you that I can be here — you helped Jarilo-VI open up to the outside!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Um... this gentleman is?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Oh, Miss March! Don't you remember me? After all the favors I did for you all in Belobog...
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: This is Firefly. She's my tour guide.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: You should get your eyesight checked. Are you sure March 7th looks like this?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...My name is Firefly. I'm a stage performer from the Iris Family.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Oh, no wonder! I was just thinking, there's no way Miss March could change her appearance so dramatically in such a short time.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: It's my pleasure to meet you! My name is Sampo — and I'm an old pal of 's.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Nice to meet you, too.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Haha, seems like we're getting on the same wavelength now!
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Since when did I acknowledge you as my friend?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Oh, don't be like that. You're making things awkward.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Narration]: Firefly, let's go.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Come on! It's been so long since we last met each other. How can you just walk away like that?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: Mr. Sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to Penacony?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: My purpose? Haha, you're funny. What else can I do in Penacony? Well, I just hang around, daydream, and do the things that anyone on vacation would do.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Speaking of which... Old pal, since fate brings us here, I'm obliged to give you a tour of this area.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: I've been watching you two for a long time. Miss Firefly does know Penacony well, but when it comes to "entertainment for grownups," I think I can do much better.
[Tales from the Golden Age][Firefly]: ...Entertainment for grownups?
[Tales from the Golden Age][Sampo]: Looks like my analysis is spot-on. Follow me, you two. Let me give you a taste of the adult world!

[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Well... Mr. Sampo...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Anything bothering you, Miss Firefly?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Don't worry! This isn't going to involve anything illegal!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: It takes a long time to reach the other side on foot. How about we just bounce over there using the pinball machine!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Pinball machine? 's not fully acclimated to the Dreamscape yet. This could get dangerous...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Dangerous? Miss Firefly, we're in a beautiful dreamland crafted by The Family. How could it be dangerous? This is the perfect place to have some thrills!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Come on, ! Show her what you're made of!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Is this... the lower level of the Commercial District?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Bingo. Our destination is right there — Peppy Pepeshi's Salon!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: This is no ordinary salon. The only guests allowed to enter are the Pepeshi people — or those with VIP cards.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: But then again, nothing is too difficult for Sampo.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Here we are again, pal!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: Eh? Oh... it's you. You here to relax?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Right. I have two friends here who want to come with me. Any seats left inside?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: How many of you?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Three.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: Show me your VIP card.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: No problem! Here it is!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: I'm talking about your friends. I've already seen yours.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Um, well, how can my friends have VIP cards when they've only just arrived, haha.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Can you make an exception and let them in? I'll provide my VIP card as guarantee that they won't cause any trouble, okay?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: No, I can't break the rules. Please go home if you don't have the card.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Seems like we can't go in.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: What should we do?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Forget it.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: What the heck is this?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Just stay cool! Let me think of something... Got it!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Okay, so, we aren't going in anymore. But could you help me pick up something I left inside?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: "The Moment of Betrayal," "The Cloud of Doubt," and "Everlasting Hatred." Just mention the "Clown's items" to Miss Thunderbolt — she'll understand what I mean.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: What are you talking about?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Just a few... intense emotions. As far as how we'll use them, you just wait and see!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Clown?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Tsk, just be patient! I'll explain everything when the time comes!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: Sure thing, I'll deliver your message to her. Please wait here.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Pepeshi Bodyguard]: Here's the items you asked for. Miss Thunderbolt said these alone wouldn't be enough. She wanted you to have these Broken Dreams — she said do with them as you see fit.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Miss Thunderbolt is such a thoughtful person! Thank you so much.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Now, we're only short of one item, which we might be able to find in an arcade machine... Coincidentally, there's one at the salon entrance. Let's get moving. I want to show you something fun.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Is that... a TV?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Why was this TV... dumped on the side of the road?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Haha, I'm afraid you're mistaken, Miss Firefly! This is an arcade! This fine machine has a sense of aesthetics worthy of the Dreamscape — it's nothing like the techy junk you see around Punklorde.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: , how about you try touching it and see what happens?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Couldn't hurt, I guess...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Well... I might be totally off base here, but I think there's something fishy with this TV.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: But it's fine if you want to give it a shot... I trust your judgment.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Why don't you try it yourself?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: I want to let you enjoy this firsthand experience, hee-hee.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Of course, it's just a suggestion. If you aren't up for it, I'll do it myself...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Is this a trap?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Well... I do think there's something fishy with this TV.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: This belongs to The Family. How can there be anything wrong with it? If you aren't up for it, I'll just do it myself...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: The two almost synchronously turn their gaze towards you. Or perhaps more precisely, it was three of them — including the guy with a trembling oversized nose and sunglasses on the screen.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You know it's time to make a choice. So, do you want to take a chance and touch this television, to see what *intriguing* events might unfold?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Touch it!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You take a deep breath, close your eyes, muster your courage, and reach out to the suspicious screen in front of you
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Touch it!!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You take a deep breath, close your eyes, muster your courage, and with a resolve akin to facing death, you reach out to the suspicious screen before you...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Touch it!!!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You take a deep breath, close your eyes, muster great courage, and with a resolve as weighty as three exclamation marks, you reach out to the suspicious screen before you...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Seems like I'm left with no other options.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You reach out to the suspicious screen in front of you...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: ...Oh, my!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Wait, what...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Why did you turn into this... thing!?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: I have no idea. What happened?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: "I don't know... What's happening?" — You desperately want to say these, but somehow, you've transformed into a certain... cartoon character.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Your name is Hanu, a candid and taciturn figure — a calm, reliable, cool leader of the werewolves from Penacony's famous, long-form cartoon, Clockie.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You silently protect the peace of Dreamville. According to your character traits, you can only make a cool grunting noise as a response right now.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: I think I've been sucked into the TV...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: "Looks like I got sucked into the TV" — You desperately want to say this, but somehow, you've transformed into a certain... cartoon character.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Your name is Hanu, a candid and taciturn figure — a messenger of justice and leader of the werewolves versed in conventional and unconventional arms from Penacony's famous, long-form cartoon, Clockie.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You silently protect the peace of Dreamville. According to your character traits, you can only make a cool grunting noise as a response right now.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Gosh, you guys are tall!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: "Goodness me, you guys are so tall" — You desperately want to say this, but somehow, you've transformed into a certain... cartoon character.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Your name is Hanu, a candid and taciturn figure — a lover of your hat and leader of the werewolves from Penacony's famous, long-form cartoon, Clockie. You're also the mascot of the Bloodhound Family.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You silently protect the peace of Dreamville. According to your character traits, you can only make a cool grunting noise as a response right now.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Let out a really cool sounding *hmph*
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You make an extremely cool grunt. Man, really, it was so cool.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: You look so... cool.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: You've got swag now, pal!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: So, how did  turn into that...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: You don't get it, do you? Well,  was sucked into the TV just now and swapped bodies with Hanu. Hold on, let me take a closer look...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: ...Look! The title of this game is Hanu's Adventure. According to the plot synopsis, you have been shrunken down by one of Stone's devices. You will embark on an epic adventure to rescue Dreamville with your miniature body...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Now, if you want to return to your normal size, you have to do everything that Hanu has done in the cartoon series — or you can just touch this TV.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Fine. What do I need to do?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: "Alright, then what should I do?" You already completely understand the situations, and decide to ask your old friend about what actions you should take next, but your character design doesn't permit you to do such a thing.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You can only make a cool grunting noise as a response right now.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: How do you know that?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: "How do you know?" You really want to ask your old friend how they're so confident, but your character design doesn't permit you to do such a thing.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You can only make a cool grunting noise as a response right now.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: I'm not going to take you at your word again.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: "I will never believe you again." You really want to reply to your old friend in rage, but with your current state, the best you can do is jumping up to strike his knees.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Additionally, your character design will not permit such an action from you. Right now, you can only emit a cool *grunt* as a response.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Let out a really cool sounding *hmph*
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: You make a cool grunting noise. Have you thought about why you'd ever change back if you can keep being this cool?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Oh, here it says, "Enter the door to start your adventure." You have to climb inside from there to start your challenge, pal.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: ...We'll cheer you on, .
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Haha, of course we will. Good luck, !
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Oh, ! You're back!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: You didn't finish the game, did you? Well, I'm going to have to ask you to finish that game — I need those game rewards so I can let you two experience something fun.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: Hahaha, I've finally caught you, you little Hanu!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: Look how small you've become! You won't be able to escape this time!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: Hahaha! Your way is blocked! How pitiful!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: There's a huge secret that I would never tell you — if you swap bodies again through the TV, you'll be able to destroy the obstacle and break through! Hahaha!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: Argh! I hate my mouth for revealing my secret!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: Oh, rats! Hands off my treasures! You've no idea how hard I worked to swindle those off other people!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Boss Stone]: Fine, I'll admit it — you've rescued Dreamville once again. But you just wait... I'll be back!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: After going all around, you find yourself at the entrance to Boss Stone's maze...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: You're back, ! Are you alright?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: I'm alright.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: I'm glad to hear that!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: It was quite fun.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: I see... Anyway, I'm glad you're safe!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Do you have anything to say, Sampo?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Look at that, you did great! This is the proverbial moment of freedom! You've earned it.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Now that we've got everything we need, we just need to go into a dream. Just follow me — you're about to experience the real fun!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: This road... Are we heading back to the Oti Mall?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: That's right, Miss Firefly. That's where the good stuff is.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Welcome to Dreamscape Sales Store! Dr. Edward at your service!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Trailblazer of the Astral Express, here we are again! Haha, I see you've brought two friends with you! They seem like fun people!
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Hello, Edward. I'd like my friends to try something... fun, if you know what I mean.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Be my guest! Dr. Edward welcomes anyone who's ready for some excitement! How about we use your Dreamscape, sir?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: A superb idea, sir — let's do it. The one from last night would be perfect.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: Um... What's going on?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: This is a service we offer to our long-time customers. You can submit dreams you've recently had to me. With the relevant emotion prototypes, I'll be able to turn them into customized dream bubbles that can be experienced repeatedly.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Any dreams we want?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Exactly! Looks like you've got the picture. You've probably woken up from a dream one time, and wished you could just go back to dreaming it, right?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: What's so fun about this?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Well, whether a dream bubble is fun or not depends on what kind of dreams you've had. We all had dreams that we wished we could have continued after waking up, right?
[Good Omen, My Friend][Firefly]: A dream I wished I could have continued after waking up...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Miss Firefly, I admire your eagerness, but please be patient. Allow me to use my dream as a demonstration.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: I trust you have prepared all the necessary materials. Please hand them over to me.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Your donation is appreciated! The retrieval is complete. Now, I will calibrate the memoria and generate the dream bubble...
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: It's ready! Please close your eyes and rest your forehead against the dream bubble.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Sampo]: Jump on in, . I wish you a pleasant time.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: Are you ready to experience a wonderful dream? Please close your eyes and rest your forehead on the dream bubble.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: I'm ready.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Maybe later.
[Good Omen, My Friend][Narration]: Dr. Edward: No problem! Dr. Edward is happy to help you when you're ready!

[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: How did I end up here?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Where is everyone?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: What should I do now?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: :
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Sampo's Advice?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Become the Garbage KingThough the trash bags have long been broken
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: What do you mean by this?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: I think I've had this dream before too...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: This all feels so familiar...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: :
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Firefly]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Firefly]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: What's happening!?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Why are there trashcans everywhere?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][???]: You're finally here...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][???]: Nice to meet you, dream diver...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: My name is Shatana, and I have a deal to offer you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Deal? What deal?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Have you heard of... Tatalov the Garbage King?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Shatana? Are you related to Natasha?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Natasha who? I don't recall meeting such a person.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Let's get back to the question... Have you heard of Tatalov the Garbage King?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: That line of yours sounds eerily familiar...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: You're... probably just experiencing some déjà vu...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Let's get back to the question... Have you heard of Tatalov the Garbage King?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: He's our king, as well as the manager of all the waste in this world. Perched on his throne, he uplifts trashcans that are humble and suppresses those that are violent. He's the cornerstone of Belobog, the lid that secures us, the barrel that reinforces us.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: However, since the thing from beyond the sky arrived here along with the Eternal Freeze, Tatalov's eyes have been blinded. He stopped listening to our calls, leaving the impoverished to be bullied and his loyal servants to be degraded...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: The humiliation was too much for us. We intended to help Garbage King mend his ways under the banner of the Skyfire... But we were no match for the sinister king, who spread vicious rumors among the trashcans to divide us against each other. As a result, we could no longer communicate with one another using trashbags...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: ...I implore your help to restore peace to the trash bags, so that the trashcans here may be united once more. Then, we'll be able to launch a counterattack against that undeserving king.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Are you saying you want me to rally you all together?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Firefly]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: You're speaking in riddles...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Firefly]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Well, that seals the deal.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: What do I need to do?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Deal? What deal?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: But I haven't agreed to anything!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: 
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: You have one mission — help the trashcans with their troubles and collect three Proofs of Trust.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Once you've accomplished that, you'll become our new king and lead our fight against the evil king. Off you go, dream diver... Your mission is calling for you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: :
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Off you go, dream diver... Your mission is calling for you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Courageous Can]: We've had enough of Tatalov's oppression! To retrieve our belongings from his treasure trove, the resources vital to our livelihoods seized by Tatalov's greed and tyranny, we must open this door.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Push the door.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Kick the door.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Open sesame!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Strange, you haven't done anything, but the door opens slowly — it turns out that this is an automatic sensor door. It just can't sense trashcans.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Courageous Can]: The door is open... The legends are true! You are the savior destined to defeat Tatalov! The God of Trash sent you to return the tyrant's treasures to us!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Courageous Can]: Ah, I've never felt so exhilarated before! When you raise the banner of rebellion against Tatalov, I and the other oppressed cans shall stand by your side!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: You watch the trashcans excitedly crowd into the "treasure trove," tearing open bag after bag of garbage and pouring the contents into their torso...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: This is a normal-looking trashcan. How magical! A kingdom of trashcans actually has an ordinary trashcan... This is a rare opportunity. Do you wish to do something to it?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Insert trash.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Of course. That's the job of a trashcan. You chuck whatever random things you have on hand into its pitch-black and bottomless void. A series of loud sounds thundered back.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Remove some trash.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Of course. That's the value of a trashcan. When you used your finger to touch its sides, a burst of loud sounds followed.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Give it a kick.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: ...Evidently, this is not civilized behavior. In regular circumstances, you'd probably have to give up a Praise of High Morals... However, this is the Dreamscape, so who cares? You feel your foot impact the can with a loud bam...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: When you open your eyes again, the trashcan is no longer just a trashcan. It's now a trashcan... with arms and legs.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashcan Prince]: Thank you, beautiful stranger. I am the Trashcan Prince, and my father was assassinated by Tatalov, and I was cursed into becoming a trashcan. You saved me from internment.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashcan Prince]: I shall offer everything I have — my body, my soul, my life, even my trash bags — just to repay your kindness.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: You talk like a Knight of Beauty...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashcan Prince]: There are many cans who compliment my beauty, but I am not familiar with the name of which you just spoke. The only knightly order in this kingdom is the "Knights of Loose Change," each of whom is a noble and respectable can of the highest order.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Then stand with me against Tatalov.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashcan Prince]: I will. I will stand with you and ignite the rising smoke of rebellion until the kingdom is saved from absolute peril.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashcan Prince]: You have earned my confidence. I wish for you to accept this item and my heart as a token of my sincere gratitude. I will fight for you, O glorious soul.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashcan Prince]: You have earned my confidence. I will fight for you, O glorious soul.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Serious Can]: Then who is worthy of it?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Beautiful Can]: Only I should have it!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Wise Can]: This requires further discussion...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Three trashcans stand around each other, arguing ceaselessly about a certain matter...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Serious Can]: Outlander, a dispute awaits your fair judgment.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Beautiful Can]: This is the legendary golden trash, a symbol of power and status. Only the most qualified trashcan may lay claim to it. All of us feel that we are that trashcan, and so we keep fighting for it.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Wise Can]: So, we have decided that an observer possessing unique and just insight should be the judge for this matter and decide to whom the reward will belong, and bring a conclusive end to this long dispute.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Serious Can]: If you give the golden trash to me, I will pledge you endless wealth, more than enough to fill the biggest trashcan there is.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Wise Can]: If you give the golden trash to me, I will grant you endless knowledge, more than any full bag of trashcan provide.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Beautiful Can]: If you bestow upon me this golden trash, I shall promise you the most beautiful trashcan in the world — myself. I will stand beside you as a partner beyond peer and face all your trials and triumphs by your side.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: So... what is your choice?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Split golden trash into three and distribute evenly.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Amidst the watchful gaze of the three, you perfectly split the golden trash. Not even a Clockie Pizza can be divided this evenly.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: I am the only one worthy of it!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Under the watchful eyes of the three, you claim the golden trash as your own. Indeed, among these small trashcans, is there anyone who stands as tall and upright as you do?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Wise Can]: The conundrum that has stymied us for so long... fixed just like that?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Beautiful Can]: Then who is the most qualified can... No, that no longer mattered [sic].
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Serious Can]: The outlander must be trying to help us understand how foolish this dispute of ours was... You have proven yourself with your actions. This signifies our loyalty and longing. We wish for you to have it.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Wise Can]: We all approve of your intellect and justness.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Serious Can]: You have proven yourself with your actions. We three cans shall become your aides, and win freedom once more for trashcans.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Beautiful Can]: We three cans will become your aides, and win freedom once more for our people.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: Ninety-seven thousand eight hundred sixty-three...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: This particular trashcan stands quietly. Its lid has chipped and faded paint. It is meticulously counting the roadside trash, occasionally sighing or scratching its head, as if struggling to memorize an astronomical number.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: ...Are you here to mock me too? Or are you seeking wise answers?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Why are you counting trash?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: It's a long story. A long, long time ago, I angered Tatalov. I told him that even the most stable of nations has their day of decay, and even all the trash in the stars can eventually be counted. It is unclear which part of the sentence infuriated him...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: ...As punishment, he assigned me this role, demanding that I count all the trash in the city. Before then, I am to never issue forth my opinions.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: I need "Proof of Trust."
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: Oh... it's rare for a can to be so straightforward. I do possess the "Proof of Trust," but now it's lost in the mountain of trash.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: If you want it, work with me. I have counted the majority of the trash in this city, leaving only these three newly arrived cans.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Lordly Trashcan ×1 Juvenile Sting ×2
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Clear-Headed Can: Who dares disrupt my slumber!?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: Not bad, young can. You've proven yourself by your wisdom and patience... You deserve this Proof of Trust. I'll gift it to you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Trashiemedes]: I'm now old and frail, no longer able to fight by your side. Hopefully, my mind can still be of use to you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: A strange trash bag sits in the bottomless trashcan. You notice the "seal" on the bag — A few fish bones have clipped the mouth of the bag shut.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Remove the seal.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Bam! Green smoke wafts up from within the bag together with a loud noise. It twists and congeals in the air, slowly becoming a giant... trashcan.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Finally — I am free! I am "Garboski," a can of unmatched evil. Tatalov used despicable means to defeat me and sealed me in this deep and cramped trash bag.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: For the first five hundred years of my imprisonment, I swore an oath that if a can came to save me, I would reward them with endless wealth. Then, for the next five hundred years, I swore that if a can saved me, I would reward them with endless trash.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: However, ten thousand years have passed. That's 20 five-hundred-year periods, but no cans came! Therefore, I swore that if a can came to save me, I would reward them with a painless death.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: — You've come, and so you now must die.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: This is not fair! I saved you!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Correct. I will now offer you a final mercy. You get to choose how you wish to die.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: I wish to die as a warrior!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Oh? No trashcan has ever dared to challenge me to a duel. I acknowledge your bravery... Perhaps there's no need to conduct a pointless battle.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Why not stand with me against Tatalov?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Countless years of captivity have whittled flat my edges. My prime is long past, never to return. I only wish to past [sic] the rest of my life as a normal trashcan. Farewell, stranger.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: I don't believe you were sealed in the trash bag.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Ah, yes, Tatalov used the same trick against me. "With such a massive body like yours, how can a bag fit you?" And so I slipped into a trash bag before him and found myself sealed.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Even the vilest trashcan is capable of learning to heed a lesson. Your tactics are ineffective against me now! Now, feel my ten thousand years — five hundred years times twenty — of fury!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: I didn't expect you to be so strong. I acknowledge your bravery... Perhaps there's no need to conduct a pointless battle.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Why not stand with me against Tatalov?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Countless years of captivity have whittled flat my edges. My prime is long past, never to return. I only wish to past [sic] the rest of my life as a normal trashcan. Farewell, stranger.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: But I'm a person, not a trashcan.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: You're right. You are not the savior that I expected. And because you haven't betrayed my expectations... I should thank you instead. Go. I won't take your life, but that's the limit of my mercy.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Why not stand with me against Tatalov?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Garboski]: Countless years of captivity have whittled flat my edges. My prime is long past, never to return. I only wish to past [sic] the rest of my life as a normal trashcan. Farewell, stranger.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Audience Can]: You dealt with the sealed demon, Garboski? He is so powerful and so terrifying, but you defeated him... How magnificent of you!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Audience Can]: You've won me over, along with many others. This item carries our high regard for you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: :
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Impressive... It's hard to believe you've collected all the Proofs of Trust. Your determination is truly admirable...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: Excellent. Looks like you've held up your side of the deal...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: ...I've waited so long for this day. Here, I'll escort you to your throne, the Pillars of Creation, where you'll witness the future of my people...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Shatana]: I wish you success.

[Lullaby of the North Wind][Firefly]: Hey, wait!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Firefly]: What kind of nonsense is this?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: What a bummer... I was really looking forward to seeing how  was going to overthrow the Garbage King...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: It really is a shame.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: I'd easily finish him off with one punch.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: The Garbage King? You're the real Garbage King!
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: What a huge pity! Such a meaningful dream came to an abrupt halt because of Miss Firefly...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: ...I was looking forward to seeing your face when the truth dawned on you.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Truth? What truth?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: What are you trying to say?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: ...Trying to say? I'm not saying anything, I just want to reveal the truth...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Is this weird dream trying to hint at some hidden meaning?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: Hint at? No, more like reveal...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: Don't you want to find out the truth behind the dream? Don't let all the pretty scenery in the dream world distract you from your goal — as soon as you get complacent, you'll lose sight of the truth.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: Don't you think this dream bubble looks really similar to modern-day Penacony?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: A small stage is crowded with a bunch of scheming people. None of them want to be exposed under the spotlight, so they all push you to the front...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: You're not at home anymore kid — you've wandered into the depths of the unknown. Let me put it to you straight — don't let yourself get enticed by that glowing light. I'm going to be very disappointed if you get bamboozled by the likes of them.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: What in the dream world are you talking about?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: Seems like you really do have no clue. Turn around and take a look...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: Sampo, just what are you up to, exactly?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: Same as always, pal. If you still don't get it, just turn around and take a look...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Narration]: A glowing light...
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: Is that girl still here?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: She claims to be a local but doesn't know how this world works — all she's got is street smarts. Who exactly is she? You don't find her the least bit... suspicious?
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: You'd better hurry up and confront her if you have any questions. Don't let her off scot-free, haha.
[Lullaby of the North Wind][Sampo]: See you around, pal... Don't let me down.

[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: The girl turns her body sideways, gazing into the distance, as if evading your gaze. After a momentary pause, she finally turns back and softly speaks.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...I'm sorry.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You don't have to apologize. I don't find you suspicious.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Thank you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I want to know the truth. Is that too much to ask?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Sure.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You feel guilty, don't you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Yes.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: There are things... I'm hiding from you...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I'm not a local, and there's a reason why the Bloodhound Family is after me... I also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...But still, I appreciate your help. I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: And my admiration for the Nameless is also genuine. You guys have been to a lot of worlds, met people from all walks of life, and experienced all sorts of things. Every day is a new beginning for you guys...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I really love that kind of life.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: It's not as great as you think...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You can board the Astral Express, too.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Can I bring you to one more place? It isn't another tourist attraction — it's my very own secret base.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I'll do my best to tell you everything I know when we get there.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Sure. I believe you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Thanks...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: How am I supposed to believe you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I... don't know, but I hope you do.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Never mind. I have no reason to be so harsh on you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'm going to be vigilant to the end.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Sure.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let's go this way...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Tick-tock! Help! Help! Can anyone help me?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Tick-tock! Help! Help me!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Someone's dying! Please come here!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What's going on?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Didn't I make myself clear? Someone is dying! Please help!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Are you asking for help?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Yes, yes! Please help! Someone's life is in your hands!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What kind of thing... are you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: I'm not some random thing, I'm a clock!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Wait... Can you... see me?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Is there a problem?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I can see a... clock with limbs.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I think I'm seeing things...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Nothing. It's inconsequential.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Can you really see me?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Tick-tock! Wonderful! This is awesome! There's still hope for Misha!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Oops, I haven't introduced myself!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: My name is Clockie. I'm a famous celebrity in Penacony! My friends and I keep the peace in this small town. They are Hanu, Mr. Soda, Origami Bird, Hamster Ball Knight...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: ...And Misha! Misha is in trouble! Tick-tock! Help! Help!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Clockie, how can I help?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Clockie? Are you a cartoon character?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: A talking clock? I must be losing my mind.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: A clock that talks?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Clockie?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Do you mean... you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Yes, I saw him.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'm not hallucinating... right?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock, I'm really here! As the humble face of Penacony, I never ever brag!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Can't you see him?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Um... Where's he? I can't see him...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock! I guess I'm only visible to those with the innocence, kindness, and honesty of a child, like this kid here clad in gray!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: He said only children can see him.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Um, but I think you look older than me in terms of appearance...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: He said you weren't innocent, kind... or honest.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Just how so!?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock, tick-tock! My gray friend, since you can see, then you must be able to help me!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: My friend, Misha, is in trouble! I'm begging you to help him before it's too late!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: He's begging for my help...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Huh...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: He says someone's life is in danger...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Uh... Is it really that bad...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Are you going to help this... um, Clockie that only you can see?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream... We can just head to the place I mentioned later...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock, tick-tock! Hurry up and follow me, gray friend!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Misha's in trouble! He's over there. Let me bring you to him!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Come on! Chop-chop! Move as fast as the Hamster Ball Knight!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: There's a crowd over there. Looks like something really did happen...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock! He's there! He's there! See, Clockie does not tell lies!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: I dare you to fight me!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Misha]: Everyone, please calm down...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Misha]: Everyone, please stay calm...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: You broke the rules! And now you're gonna pay the price!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: Punish her, boss!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: How did it come to this...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Isn't that Misha?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Eh? Who's Misha?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Isn't that Acheron?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Eh? Do you know her?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: How come they are all people I know!?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: What do you mean by "all"?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: See? I wasn't lying! Misha really is in trouble!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock! I'm begging you, my gray friend, begging you! Please help Misha!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Please fill me in on what's going on first.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Are you talking to Clockie? ...Hmm, I'm really curious too...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What should I do to help him?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Are you talking to Clockie? ..Well, it does look like things are getting out of control...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: My baseball bat can't wait to show its might!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon... No! What I mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock, tick-tock! It's all Stone's fault that things have turned out this way!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Of all the lowlifes in Dreamville, Stone's the worst. He's a greedy man who wants to drive everyone out of Dreamville so that he can have all the precious stones to himself...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: He instructed his underlings to wreak havoc in the Dreamscape, taking away everyone's positive emotions! Since then, the town has been filled with anxiety and disputes! We're no longer a family!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: As the guardian of Dreamville, I can't just sit back and do nothing. By using the power of Clockwork, I can direct the flow of positive emotions in the Dreamscape back into people's hearts — that way everyone can patch up their differences and get along again!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: My gray friend, I require your assistance! I have a feeling you'll be able to master the power of Clockwork! After all, you're the special one who can see me!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Also, you're a new visitor to this world, which means we have the element of surprise! If you take action now, we can catch him off guard!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What is "Clockwork"?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Here, I'll show you! First, close your eyes...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Are you sure about this...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: It'll be fine. I'm just demonstrating how it works! Please close your eyes...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Why don't you do it yourself?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: I can't pull it off on my own, because they can't see me! So, please close your eyes...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Tick-tock! Now, our minds have merged into one. Can you feel an energy surging through your body?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: All we have to do is use Clockwork on that cranky gangster boss and inject good emotions into him — then we'll have won!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Please bear in mind that you should never use Clockwork with malicious intent. We're the guardians of Dreamville, after all, tick-tock!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Mind your own business, ! I have to let that lady there know she's messed with the wrong person!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Here comes the Clockwork!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'll leave you to it...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Eh, can't you see where this is going? What should we do now...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: ...Hahahahaha!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: You did it! But how did he end up like this?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I saw a dial and got it moving.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Here comes the Clockwork!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I have no clue what I did. You sure I pulled that off?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: It... must have been? It's rather out of character for him to start cracking up like that all of a sudden.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: It's just that... seeing that gleeful smile on his face... he's just as scary as he was before.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Hello, everyone! Please allow me to welcome all of you to Penacony, Land of the Dreams!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Come on now, line up and give our honored guests a warm welcome!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: S—Sure!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Ready... Go!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: Welcome to Penacony, Land of the Dreams!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Um... Thank you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: It's my honor! It's only right we give guests a proper welcome!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: You're welcome!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: No need for such formalities. We're... a Family!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: You're right! We're a family to THEM!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: We're a family!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You may rise.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: We're at your disposal! You're our most distinguished guest!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: Your happiness is our priority!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Wow! Seems like you've established yourself as an important figure around here. In that case, can you ask them to leave now?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I appreciate the gesture...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: ...But, can we have some privacy, please?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Sure thing! You're the boss... Gang, let's give our VIP some space!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: Yes, boss!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: ...What got into me just now?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Hey, he seems normal now. That's wonderful! You did it!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I saw a dial and got it moving.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Great! It means you've mastered the art of Clockwork!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I have no clue what I did. You sure I pulled that off?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: It... must have been? Otherwise, why would he suddenly be all calm and composed like this?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Was I... about to get into a fight with that lady? Was I crazy?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: What's wrong with boss?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Hey, may I ask you a question? Were you the one who made me simmer down earlier? I wasn't my normal self..
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: It's the least I can do.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Thanks for doing that. If we'd laid a finger on our guests just now, we would've faced severe punishment from the Bloodhound Family.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Wow, you've become so well-mannered.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: We owe it to you — if we'd laid a finger on our guests just now, we would've faced severe punishment from the Bloodhound Family.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: I'm so sorry for stirring up all this trouble... Alas, why did I get so worked up all of a sudden? It's baffling...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Oh, my gray friend! You have to tell him that Stone is behind this!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Everyone loses it once in a while.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: This is embarrassing... I feel bad for causing such a spectacle.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Perhaps, it's because we're all in a dream.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Haha, that can be one of the reasons.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: It's Boss Stone's doing. Can you believe it?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Stone? Um, I'm not sure I get what you mean...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Anyway, I owe everyone a proper apology. Gang, line up and say sorry to our honored guests!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: S—Sure!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Ready... Go!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: We're truly sorry for the trouble we caused!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Wow, they look really sincere. In that case, can you ask them to leave now?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I appreciate the gesture...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: ...But, can we have some privacy, please?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: Sure thing! You're the boss... Gang, let's give our VIP some space!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: Yes, boss!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... *sob*...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Oh, goodness! Did you make him cry?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I saw a dial and got it moving.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Great! It means you've mastered the art of Clockwork!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I have no clue what I did. You sure I pulled that off?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: It... must have been? Otherwise, why would he be in tears all of a sudden?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... *sob*...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: What's wrong with boss?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Oh, he's crying so hard. Even I, the guardian of the Dreamville, am nearly moved to tears.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What's wrong sweetie? Why are you feeling so down?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... I... thought about my mother on my home planet...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Bruh, quit the waterworks. You're a big boy now.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... I... thought about my mother on my home planet...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Oh dear me, ain't I a big bad meanie for making you sob like a crybaby?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... It isn't your fault. I just suddenly... thought about my mother on my home planet...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: What do we do now?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Woah, things are turning into a mess. But then again, maybe now is a good chance to ask them to leave?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: My friend, why don't you go and...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: How about you get some alone time somewhere?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... You're right...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gangster Boss]: *sob*... Gang, you are dismissed... I need to be alone for a while...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gang Members]: Yes, boss!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Misha]: We meet again! Are you the one who helped settle everything down here?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Misha, are you acquainted with this gray friend of mine?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Misha]: 's an esteemed guest whom I've befriended recently. I told you about  before. Does it ring a bell?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Oh, it's !
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Misha]: Anyway, thanks a lot! If you hadn't gotten here in time, I would have been in a real mess...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Thank you, . I'm surprised we get to see each other again so soon.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: No need to thank me. It's the least I can do.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'm surprised too.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: About all the commotion just now... I heard a bunch of Masked Fools were causing a ruckus on the streets. I happened to be passing through, got stopped for questioning, and there were some... misunderstandings along the way. Anyway, I owe you another one.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Is this lady... your friend too?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Well, we've only met each other once before. But  is a kind soul for helping me at the hotel.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: It's my pleasure to meet you, beautiful lady.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: B—Beautiful lady...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: By the way, what did you do to that man earlier? It was like someone took him on an emotional roller coaster.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I was wondering about that too... What happened back there, exactly?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Clockie taught me some Clockwork.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: That's right! It was me, Clockie!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Of course, you played a big part too. Without you doing the Clockwork, Dreamville would've been in some real trouble!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Talk therapy. I used that on him.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: What're you talking about? It wasn't talk therapy! It was Clockwork!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: I don't think it's that simple.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Could it have something to do with... That Clockie that only you can see?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: It's only natural for people to get intimidated by my baseball bat.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: What're you talking about? It wasn't the baseball bat! It was Clockwork!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: I don't think it's that simple.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Could it have something to do with... That Clockie that only you can see?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: ...Clockie?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Yes, that cartoon character. I think he's shown up in reality — I mean — in the Dreamscape.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I don't really know how a cartoon character could show up around here, but according to , only honest people with childlike innocence can see him...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: ...It seems like I'm too old to qualify for that.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: If Clockie really exists, that can explain a lot of things.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Eh, can you see me too?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: I can feel the presence of something inexplicable next to you, but it's a shame that I can't communicate with him like you can.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: We can both perceive these extraordinary things in the dream, probably due to our ability to react to memoria. But you're more attuned to it than I am.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: I thought your heightened perception was caused by something the elegant Memokeeper might have left in your mind. Now, it seems to me there are many more special beings like her in this dream.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: The elegant Memokeeper?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Who is she?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Shortly after we parted ways, I wandered into a ball without realizing it. A lady wearing a black veil invited me to dance. It was my first dance, and it was an unforgettable experience.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Shortly after we parted ways, I met a lady wearing a black veil who was also a guest at the hotel. We had a good time talking about the event over drinks.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Shortly after we parted ways, I felt someone's spying eyes on me. I looked in the mirror and spotted a lady wearing a black veil. We had a deep conversation, but I won't bore you with the details.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: It's a shame that I forgot to ask her for her name. I only know that she's from the Garden of Recollection.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Garden of Recollection... Is it the group that serves the Aeon of Remembrance?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Exactly. They traverse freely between different worlds as memetic entities and are only visible to certain people. Doesn't she sound very much like that Clockie you saw?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: After all, it is a grand event held by The Family. The guestlist could be a lot longer than we imagine.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Once again, thank you for being kind to me. I wish you a great time in the dream, and I shall not interrupt your... date?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: N—No! We're not on a date!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Acheron]: Hehe.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...She's gone. Well, shall we?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: I'll let you get back to your beeswax. Thanks, my gray friend!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Misha]: I really appreciate your help! The Nameless are indeed a bunch of talented people... May our paths cross again!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: May our paths cross again, tick-tock!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Please come with me. I hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Sorry, I'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place... You go first, and I'll be right behind you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Here...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Here we are. This is the place.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: This place looks mighty fine.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Is this your secret stronghold?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: No, it isn't...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...This is.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What a beautiful manhole cover.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Is this... your secret stronghold?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Yes, it's right inside.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Inside? What does that mean?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Just the literal meaning.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Do you want me... to crawl in there?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: This is embarrassing. People are watching us...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: It doesn't matter! Anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. The pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let me show you how to do it. It's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: : ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Hey, let me ask you something...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Is following girls around like a lost puppy your way of getting their attention? You've been doing this for nearly half a system hour.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: To be more precise, it's been 45 minutes. Time sure flies when you're having fun, doesn't it?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: *sigh* Spare me. Beautiful eyes though — are you from Sigonia?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: Need another hint? I'm an Avgin.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: My eyes might not be as pretty as yours, but there's no problem with my vision...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: You Sigonians are notorious throughout the entire universe! Liars, thieves, social manipulators, wolves in sheep's clothing... You're really living up to the reputation.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: I say you belong to the space under the manhole cover, not in a dream. There's one right over there. Off you go!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: I'll pass — the gloomy shade of a place like that just wouldn't go with my vibe. Dreamville is frivolous, vain, and flashy — and that suits me just fine.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: ...Also, it never rains here! My outfit is too expensive to be exposed to the elements.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Cut it out and go home, you slick talker. We are Fools, but we aren't stupid. We aren't interested in playing the friend game with the lapdogs of the IPC.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: Really? You've never been friends with anyone from the IPC?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Do you think I know nothing about the history of Penacony? Don't drag me into your banal office politics.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: Fool, you've been left with no choice since the moment you accepted the invitation to be here. You better pick a side while you have the chance, or else you'll end up losing everything.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: You sound very sure of yourself. Looks like you've already convinced that Chicken Wing Boy from The Family.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: How did you do it, little peacock? Did you strip yourself naked, apologize to him on your knees, and promise that IPC would never harm Penacony?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Friends? Oh, please. You guys only treat others as your bargaining chips.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: What's wrong with chips? In any gamble, the only players that will never be on the losing side are the chips. My friends from the Garden of Recollection and Astral Express are all smart enough to understand that.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: But the smarter ones wouldn't have joined the game in the first place. See? I'm smarter.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Listen, little peacock. You've been invited by the Tavern before too. If you want the Masked Fools to get onboard, you need to figure out what it is The Laughter wants.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: Here's a hint for you — Since you can't convince anyone, why don't you befriend a mute? At least, a mute won't be able to refute your arguments. *laughs*
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][???]: So long!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: Thanks! I'll keep your advice in mind!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Aventurine]: ...What a pain in the neck. I guess I'll have to meet with The Family again.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Here...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: We're almost there.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Look! This place is breathtaking, isn't it?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. Just think of this as the border of Golden Hour. The Family is still building and remodeling the Dreamscape beyond here.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: My secret stronghold is in this area.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let's sneak inside.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Excuse me, there's a construction site ahead. Unauthorized personnel are not allowed in.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Drat... We're caught right away.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Could you let us through just this time?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Fine. We'll head back.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let me try.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Could you... please make an exception? We're not going to cause any trouble.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Not a chance. Our boss made it clear that only the Dreamweavers are allowed here.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: He won't budge...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: We know Gallagher.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Who? Never heard of him. I wouldn't let you in even if the Dreammaster were here.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Here are some credits for you...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Get those out of my sight, and I'll pretend nothing happened this time. Try pulling something like that again, and I'll report it to the Oak Family.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Pretty please...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: People ask for favors every day. Am I supposed to just say yes to all of them?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: None of your tricks are going to work. Please do yourself and me a favor and go home.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Hmm, seems like he won't give in... Let me think of another way...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: None of your tricks are going to work. Please do yourself and me a favor and go home.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: The composed man before you appears impenetrable. Perhaps you need to provoke him a bit.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'll leave you to it...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Thank you for your cooperation.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh my goodness...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh my... Oh my, oh my, oh my!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Ok, buddy, what's gotten into you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: I feel like... I'm on cloud nine!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You're acting weird... This is bad.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Bad? How so? I feel like... I'm on cloud nine!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Oh my, oh my, oh my...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Ha, buddy. You look... as delighted as me!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Can you feel it? This is... wild! It feels like I just downed ten bottles of Epochal SoulGlad in one gulp and spent an entire day at the Dreamscape Sales Store!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: If Mia were here, we would sing a song together. I'm sure she would understand how I feel!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: I can hardly contain this palpable excitement... I'd like to invite you to dance with me, . Right here, right now!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Will you let us in after I dance with you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh, no way! Rules are rules!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: It's totally fine if you want to turn me down!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I have to... say no.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh, that's a downer... but not for me! I'm still brimming with elation!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: This crazy mood and this pounding heart are just what I need... I wish it would last forever!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Still, I won't let you guys in, because it's my duty to stop you!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: He really is a man of principle.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts again.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: The man has become content but remains impenetrable. Perhaps you need to provoke him a bit.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts again.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Ah, honored guests... Welcome to Penacony.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: I'm a member of the Bloodhound Family. My job is maintaining order in the Dreamscape. In fact, no danger will arise under The Family's protection, which makes my job redundant. Even a trashcan is more important than me.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Don't sell yourself short.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh, sorry about that. I just can't help myself.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Well, you're in luck then, for I Am The Danger!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Please refrain from that. I know I won't be able to overcome you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: But trashcans are important! I like them!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: In that case, I'd recommend that you see Dr. Edward for a psychotherapy session.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Anyway, please just give me some privacy.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: You two should enjoy this fun and exciting Dreamscape, instead of talking to someone who is worse than a trashcan.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Well, can you let us through?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh, no way.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: There's little dignity left in me. Please be nice and don't trample on it.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Well, please stop blocking our way.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Oh, I'm sorry for blocking your way.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: But there's little dignity left in me. Please be nice and don't trample on it.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Sure enough, you guys can force your way through, but I swear I'll stop you or die trying. After all, I have nothing left to lose...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I feel really bad...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: The man mentioned "die trying"... It might just be worth a try to give him what he wanted. That is, if you can live with it.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts again.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: How many times do I have to repeat myself? Unauthorized personnel are not allowed at the construction site!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Do you two really want to stay here and test my patience? You're going to regret it!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Come on! Let's fight!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: You're asking for it! And I wouldn't be so cocky if I were you — I deal with punks like you all the time!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: That's not what I mean...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Don't try talking back to me. I deal with punks like you all the time!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: You fear for nothing just because you're young and energetic. You idle away your time every day, going around stirring up trouble! You contribute nothing to society!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Let me help you spoiled brats learn the hard way. Go, Sweet Dreams Troupe! Teach them a lesson!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Dreamjolt Troupe's Mr. Domescreen ×1 Dreamjolt Troupe's Bubble Hound ×2
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Darn it, I can't believe I've lost... Is this the power of youth...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: If I'd had that power back then, would we have ended up differently, Mia?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Alright, you can go in. As the winner, you deserve it...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously... Well, at least we finally get to go through...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Never imagined that's how we'd end up getting past the guard... That trick of Clockie's really is amazing.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Bloodhound Family Member]: Alright, you can go in. As the winner, you deserve it...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: The path ends here. For the rest of the way, we need to borrow the Dreamweaver's tools.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: What happens next is going to blow your mind...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Now, we can go to the other side. This is how the Nightingale Family repairs the Dreamscape. Fascinating, isn't it?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: We can use the building materials that are floating around in the air.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: It's like stepping on planks floating on water.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let's go that way.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: We can get to the rooftop of the opposite building from here, but it requires a device. I remember it's hidden here...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Bam, and it comes out just like that. No matter how many times I've seen it, it still looks magical.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let's go.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Look, that's the Penacony Grand Theater over there.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: It radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I suppose everyone who likes to bask in the light will be drawn to that kind of warmth...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Like countless fireflies chasing the fire.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let's go. Half the journey is still ahead of us.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: This one is a little bit complicated... I have to put on my thinking cap.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I wonder whether I can still control the floating building materials in this condition...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: The Family recruited many artists, architects, and scholars from across the universe to form the team of Dreamweavers that built the dream of Penacony.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: These areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. It's not as lively as the town center here, but I relish the serene atmosphere.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: We moved from that building to this building in the blink of an eye... This would be impossible in reality.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: It's the same routine. You've mastered it, right?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Argh... What exactly went wrong?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Is it because I've gone for too long without drinking SoulGlad, or because I've been working overtime for two months? Why don't I have any inspiration today?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You seem distressed...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Can I have the puzzle piece?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Give yourself a break, mate.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: ...Who's there!?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Why are there guests here... You know what, I don't care how you snuck in, just leave me alone. If you prevent me from finishing my work on time, I'm going to make you pay for it!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: It seems you need to find a way to uplift the Dreamweaver.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: Huh? This person's Emo Gear is missing, tick tock!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: We can obtain the required gear using Emotion Absorption.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Clockie]: I feel there might be gears close by. Let's go find them.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I won't bother you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Haul yourselves over to somewhere else! I need to be alone!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gleeful Guest]: This is a great spot for a date, huh?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Delighted Guest]: That's impressive!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gleeful Guest]: Haha, you see! I told you this would be a great spot for a date, right? Check it out? Isn't the view enchanting?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Delighted Guest]: That's impressive! Got a lot of good ideas, you do! This place has a great view, and you can see all of the Golden Hour from here...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Delighted Guest]: ...Though, how are we going to leave? We're not climbing the ventilation ducts again, are we?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Gleeful Guest]: Argh. That... well, there's got to be a way! Don't think about that much stuff. Let's enjoy what we've got now first!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Argh... What exactly went wrong?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: It seems you need to find a way to uplift the Dreamweaver.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Ah-ha, I've got it! What a brilliant idea it is! I must write it down on paper while it's fresh in my mind...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: ...No, no, no. I'm sure I'll forget all the details when I wake up from sleep. There's no better time than now to put it into action!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: He wandered off, but he left behind the puzzle piece.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I won't bother you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Dreamweaver]: Haul yourselves over to somewhere else! I need to be alone!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Was the other puzzle piece... taken away by it?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Dreamjolt Troupe's Mr. Domescreen ×2 Dreamjolt Troupe's Birdskull ×2
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: This place is really complicated. It gives me a headache every time I pass through... Not only do we have to activate the Dream's Eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Phew... finally. There won't be too many hindrances after this.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Step DescriptionFirefly explains this place to you]: It is the edge of the Golden Hour, the inner depths of the Dreamscape, and The Family's construction and remodeling zone . She adds that her "secret stronghold" is further on... The only problem is that "The Family" has eyes everywhere and you will have to sneak in to get inside.After overcoming a variety of obstacles, your final destination lies just ahead. Unfortunately, there are many monsters occupying the path ahead. Proceed with caution. Dream's Edge
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Um, this area wasn't guarded the last time I was here... Have my frequent comings and goings started drawing attention?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...I don't think we can get around them. Knocking them out is the only way to go...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'm ready.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: At long last, this baseball bat of mine has found its purpose.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Let's get rid of them!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Step DescriptionFirefly explains this place to you]: It is the edge of the Golden Hour, the inner depths of the Dreamscape, and The Family's construction and remodeling zone . She adds that her "secret stronghold" is further on... The only problem is that "The Family" has eyes everywhere and you will have to sneak in to get inside.You have successfully overcome every obstacle on your path. Congratulations! Your final destination lies just ahead. Dream's Edge
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Here we are. This is the place.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: :
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Have you heard of the song? It's called If I Can Stop One Heart From Breaking, by Robin. Her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the Charmony Festival is drawing close.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: This spot is the closest place to the sky in the Dreamscape. It's far from the hustle and bustle of the city and free from the bickering among the Dreamweavers. You can feel the moment — the scenery, the people, and the dreams — without being disturbed by anyone...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: How beautiful... Time is frozen at this golden hour, this golden dream shared by the Fool from the Tavern and the Memokeeper from the Garden of Recollection, the wandering Ranger and the IPC ambassador, the Astral Express Nameless... and me.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Everyone falls asleep here equally, regardless of our different agendas...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ... I'm sorry, . I really am a stowaway.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I know.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I knew I couldn't hide it from you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I never saw that coming...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I think it's only right to tell you.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: My hometown was destroyed a long time ago. It was probably the doing of the Legion or the Swarm... I'm an interstellar refugee, just like many of the Penacony locals.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: The Harmony accepts everyone, including wanderers from afar. The Family takes them in, but they... don't belong here.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: In this splendid metropolis, some have a dream called Penacony, but some have dreams... that are no different from reality, even though everyone who comes here harbors the same motive in the beginning.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: And it's likewise for me. I have a wish I want to achieve so badly in the real world, but I can't. So, I want to give it a shot here...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I know the feel.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: What's your wish?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You can't run away from reality.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Entropy Loss Syndrome. Have you heard of this term?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: It's a strange condition. Those suffering from it will experience an irreversible chronic dissociation of their physical structure. This means they will slowly fade away, and the process is barely noticeable to others...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: You can still run, jump, and talk as usual. Everything seems normal, but then you'll start doing everything slightly slower than others...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...And then even slower than that, until the lines between your body and the entire world become blurry. You won't be able to tell reality from dreams because they have all been shattered.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: So, how could I possibly resist it... I mean can you imagine? I can actually free myself from this icy medical cabin in this dream...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I can forget about all the doctor's advice. I can listen, and see, and touch, and think, and understand whatever I want with my body. So, although this world isn't real, this experience is priceless...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Just like this moment.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I'm sorry. For certain reasons, there are things I can't reveal to you yet. But there are also things you should know.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I am, in fact, after the Watchmaker's Legacy, but that doesn't mean we have to go our separate ways and be enemies. But at least... I hope things won't turn out that way.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I hope so too.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Thanks.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I can't make any promises.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...It's okay. Thanks.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I can't put my trust in someone who hides things from me.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...I understand, and I'm okay with that.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Who exactly are you?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I'll tell you, but... not now.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: In my dream, I saw a scorched earth, and a new sapling emerging from it. It bloomed against the morning sun, and whispered to me.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I still remember the question on the invitation letter — Why does life slumber?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: You see, everything is possible in this land of dreams. The nightmarish past will disperse and fade away like bubbles in water, and the future that you don't want to face will never come.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Why do people choose to sleep? I think...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: It is because they're afraid to wake up from the dream.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I'm sorry things are getting all bleak and serious... Let me see what I can do to lighten the mood.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I mean, don't you have lots of friends on the Astral Express? What would you guys do if something like this happened?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Pom-Pom would cool us down with water from a spray can...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Spray can? That's... rough.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Perhaps, there's something else we can do?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Dan Heng would tell us dry jokes with a deadpan expression...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Jokes? Um, I... don't really have a good sense of humor...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Perhaps, we can think of another way?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Himeko would make coffee for us...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Coffee... We can't really make that here...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Aren't there... other Crew members we can take inspiration from?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Mr. Yang would try to change the subject...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I... have been trying to do that...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...But I think I failed. Maybe... there are other things that you guys do?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: March would force us to take a selfie with her...
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Selfie, selfie... You're right. I've been here so many times. Why didn't I think of taking a photo?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I feel a little awkward taking it by myself. Would you like to join me? Let's commemorate this moment.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: Sure.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I can be a little bit camera-shy — just don't laugh at me. Here, you hold the camera.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I don't think so.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: ...Is there a problem?
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I'm kidding. Let's do it!
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: I can be a little bit camera-shy — just don't laugh at me. Here, you hold the camera.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: I don't want to.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Well... Okay.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: The girl hands the phone to you, her eyes filled with expectation.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Narration]: You take the phone, launch the camera app, and switch to the front-facing camera effortlessly. Then, extending your arm, you hold the phone at a distance, ensuring both of you are captured in the frame.
[Gentleness, the Name of Nocturne][Firefly]: Wait, let me get ready.

[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: We meet again, my dear...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: It looks like you have not taken my warnings to heart... A pity. Are you so enchanted by that girl?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: You're just so... blind.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: ...Careful. I'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: Oho, this brave little girl appears to be protecting you. I wonder why? Are you two that close?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: You talk too much.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: I love your attitude, my dear. I have to admit you're different from your friend here — your senses are much sharper.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: Even so, you are lagging far behind the main party. Have you not noticed yet? What The Family is hiding, the secret behind this sweet dream.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: And as for you — the Trailblazer who saved the Ice World... I wonder how many things Sampo glossed over when recounting the happenings on Jarilo-VI? Oh well, it was my problem for trusting him...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo]: ...I'm really, really disappointed in you.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo?]: Umm, excuse me...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sampo?]: Why don't you rest for a little while...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Sparkle]: ...inside the real Dreamscape.

[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: So quiet... nothing but the tick-tocking of the clocks...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Mikhail, where are you?

[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: :
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Ah... ! So you're really here too...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: What happened?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: Where is this?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: Don't tell me we're dead...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: I... don't know.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: In any case, we must still be in a dream. It can't be anywhere else, much less reality... I'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: But this is very different from the "sweet dream" that I'm familiar with — suffocating... silent... uneasy... And these floating words. Can you see them too? This kind of place would never exist on Penacony under the provision of The Family. So, could this be a dream bubble...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: No, that's not right. Do you remember, before we were unconscious, that friend of yours said: The real Dreamscape...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: This is the real Dreamscape...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: I'm not sure. Everything happened so quickly. But regardless, The Family must be hiding something — something about the truth of the Dreamscape...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: This is The Family's secret...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: I'm not sure. Everything happened so quickly. But regardless, The Family must be hiding something — something about the truth of the Dreamscape...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: He's not my friend.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: I should've been wary of him sooner... Sorry. Regardless, The Family must be hiding something — something about the truth behind the Dreamscape...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: And, you probably noticed it when you woke up as well — the ticking of clocks all around us... My gut tells me that the secret hidden here is also linked to that mysterious Watchmaker.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: If it points us towards the Watchmaker's Legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to Penacony's dream...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Let's go, ... We have to move — be it to find an exit, or the truth.
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: I see... Are we playing hide-and-seek?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: We can't get through here. Let's take the way around from the side.
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Are you done hiding?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Ready or not? Here I come.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Dead-end here too... Given the layout of the room, are they really suggesting we maneuver around using the walls?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Can't believe that worked. Tampering with the Dreamscape's gravity is clearly strictly forbidden...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: ...Careful, there are some strange things on the wall... And they don't look like they're from the Dreamjolt Troupe...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Mikhail, where are you hiding?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Mikhail...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Mikhail...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Can't find you... Can't find you anywhere...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Where are you... Where could you be...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: This is too... overwhelming...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: The exit... is on the other side? How're we going to cross over...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Mikhail! I've found you!
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Do you have something to tell me?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Wow, it's beautiful...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Incredible... This is really a sight that can only be witnessed in a dream...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: These words have been appearing and then vanishing persistently for awhile now. Whose thoughts are they? And who is this Mikhail...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: It's kinda scary...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: There is a sadness to this...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: Mikhail... Where have I heard this name...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: It's like I can feel... emotions contained within them. Confusion... fear... sadness... and others so faint I can barely feel them...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Unyielding resolve in the face of death...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Why did you come here specifically?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Mikhail, you look like you've got something on your mind...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Is it something very important?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Talk to me, Mikhail...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: It's so dark in here...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Mikhail?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: You're going?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Don't go, please?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Take me with you at least
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Okay? I beg you...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: That was a close one... but we made it.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: So strange... The Family insist that the Dreamscape is absolutely safe.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: There's nothing but... a jigsaw puzzle here.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: The pieces look like they flew to both sides of the room.
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: I will definitely keep it safe.
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: I promise you, Mikhail...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: So, you need to keep yourself safe, too...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: This is an origami bird I made for you...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Waiting Bird]: Tweet! Tweet tweet!
[Through a Glass Darkly][Waiting Bird]: Tweet...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: The red bird jumps out eagerly, but it seems you aren't the person it's waiting for.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Narration]: The bird ruffles its feathers in disappointment and flies away.
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Take it with you, Mikhail!
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: It will protect you from harm.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: This should fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Ah! The wall has vanished... Feels like we're reaching the end... right?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Er... Just one chest? I'm sure that's not a trap. Should we open it...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: ...What's going on!? The lights have all turned on. So creepy...
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: But, since there are so many doors here... we should be able to leave through one of them...

[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: This Monster—— all these creatures——are they the secret The Family is hiding?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: Ugh, is there no way to lose it...!?
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: If you don't know the right technique...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: you might never return from the shadow of Death...
[Through a Glass Darkly][???]: Emerging without a scratch
[Through a Glass Darkly][Firefly]: And you are...?
[Through a Glass Darkly][Black Swan]: Easy, girl. I'm on your side.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Black Swan]: You can call me... the Memokeeper, Black Swan.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Black Swan]: See ya next time.
[Through a Glass Darkly][Black Swan]: Hurry.

[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: You're awake, lazy bug. Looks like you had a nice dream.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: How was it? Did you dream of me?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Did you save us?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I didn't do much, just helped you leave the Memory Zone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Am I still alive...?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Are we in Heaven... Or?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Welcome to reality. More specifically, The Reverie, the safest and most familiar place you can be.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I'm happy to see that you've kept your wits, and that you haven't been affected by the *Primal Dreamscape*. How lucky.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You're the Garden of Recollection's Memokeeper...?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: What is the Primal Dreamscape...?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Firefly... Did she make it out?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Heheh, you're quite concerned about that young lady. That's fair — she was hell-bent on assuring your safety even at the brink of death... Started to tug a little at my heartstrings, even.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I know you've many questions, so please compose yourself. Before that, you should let your friends know you're safe.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Hmm, suspicious... Could it really just be a coincidence? I've got a funny feeling about that lady.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: But she did find , and save  too. The least we could do is to listen to the other party's request...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: That Memokeeper obviously came here with an agenda. We should remain vigilant.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Look, Miss Himeko: I brought the kid back as promised.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: , you're all right! We couldn't find you in either dream or reality, we were worried sick...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: It's good to see you're unharmed. Allow me to introduce you to Miss Black Swan, Memokeeper of the Garden of Recollection.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You know each other?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Yeah. Miss Himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the Dreamscape.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: We've only met once. But thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: So you're Himeko's friend.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Oh, not exactly. Miss Himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the Dreamscape.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Not quite yet. But thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: So, , how did you end up there... and what the heck happened?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: So, the one who attacked you was a girl dressed in red, adept at illusory arts, and was able to shapeshift...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Her name is Sparkle, a Masked Fool who has infiltrated Penacony... Don't worry. She won't be bothering you for now. She's probably patting herself on the back for a job well done.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: It seems you know her well.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Of course, I know everyone here. On Penacony, anyone could be lying... but the Remembrance does not lie.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: So I feel the need to clarify with everyone: Miss Sparkle's tricks can induce hallucinations, but that strange Dreamscape? Nothing to do with her — it originated from Penacony itself.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Penacony... itself?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Have you not sensed it yet? This apparent land of dreams... It's a carefully designed dream maintained by The Family through unknown means.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: And the Memory Zone  fell into, that's the true Dreamscape: Chaotic, dangerous, enigmatic... A beast of memory dwells in the ever-shifting labyrinth...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: ...She's right. Everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the Dreamscape?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Clocks...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Fish...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: The deep sea...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Huh, so everyone saw the same thing? I remember... it was a room, and then through a mirror, I came to a long hallway...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: The Gallery of Thoughts — that's how the hotel staff referred to it.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: Have you noticed? These landscapes seem quite distinct from that of Penacony's in your dream, yet strikingly similar to the Dreamscape described by Miss Black Swan.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: You're right... I didn't give it much thought at first, but in hindsight, the overlap is hard to ignore.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: Also, after speaking to some of the frequenters, the first stop when you enter the dream is supposed to be the hotel in the dream, but due to certain incidents... the hotel is now under renovation.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: What could possibly have to happen to an entire building for it to require renovation? Combine that with what  just experienced, and the answer is clear.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Penacony's dream is *sinking* right now, turning back to its original form... and falling into the deep sea.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Sinking? You mean... the Dreamscape is collapsing?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: The encounter at the dreamscape Hotel was a sign.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: ...I see. That would explain the uneasiness we've sensed from The Family.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: Leaving aside the question of guest safety, were this to become public, it would tarnish the name of the Planet of Festivities. With the Charmony Festival around the corner, it's no wonder they'd want to keep it under wraps.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Even the guests' safety cannot be assured now... Isn't the monster that  encountered indisputable proof? Need I remind you that it is a Memory Zone meme...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: How could a meme that heralds death and murder appear in a dream that The Family proclaims "to be absolutely safe"... Everyone could be lying on Penacony — does that include The Family as well?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: Miss Black Swan, we fully understand our current predicament now. Going back to your original suggestion...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: For what reason has the Garden of Recollection chosen to work with the Astral Express?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Hmm, let me rephrase then... this is my personal request, not the Garden of Recollection's. And the answer is simple. Miss Himeko, I simply wish to make an exchange... related to the Remembrance.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Apart from my duty, I also have some... personal pursuit in aesthetics. I am a Memokeeper, and a collector. I, too yearn to experience those luminous, dazzling, cherished memories. That's simple enough to understand, no?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: As for you all, Nameless of the Astral Express, and practitioners of the Trailblaze... I have faith in your potential, as well as in the... unique splendor you will unleash on the stage.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: This is why I wish to befriend all of you. A place where nightmares and sweet dreams intersect... the perfect cradle for the Remembrance.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: ...I understand. But before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Naturally, take your time.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: ...How do you see things, Himeko?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: It's best to be skeptical of her. There's a significant amount of intentional misdirection in her words.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: But I worry about the worst outcome: If the Dreamscape's anomaly really exists, and it isn't a natural occurrence, but instigated by someone behind the scenes...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: ...Then it likely has something to do with the Watchmaker's invite.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Huh, how'd you figure that one out?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: Well, excluding any extreme scenarios, the mastermind responsible for these shifts in the dreamscape undeniably stands against The Family, which narrows it down to two possibilities...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: Someone is drawing in external influences to distract and disrupt The Family's control over Penacony. Either that, or The Family has been forced to seek outside aid surreptitiously for self-preservation.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: But from the encrypted message on the invite, and The Family's reaction... The former is more likely.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: Which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted Nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side... Maybe even the same person.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Well... this doesn't necessarily mean a thing, right? In terms of methods, both the Fools and the Riddlers could pull it off. Hasn't the IPC cracked the message, too?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: March, calm down. It's just a possibility. But if this encrypted message isn't some harmless prank, but done so to invite the Trailblaze into the fray, we cannot remain uninvolved.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: Well, let me tell you what I discovered, and I'm sorry — it's bad news.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: According to reliable sources, some people spotted a tall silver-armored man on Penacony. I've reached out to the Bloodhound Family for news, and visited many of those guests who claimed to have seen this invader...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: ...And this is what I received. , I've sent it to you. Open it and take a look.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Should One Awaken at Midnight 1 Stelle.mp4      Media:Trailblaze Mission Should One Awaken at Midnight 1 Caelus.mp4
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: Ahem, can you hear me? Astral Express, it's been a while. How's Penacony?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: It's... It's that hacker girl!
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: I'll get straight to the point. I know you've all been investigating the abnormal phenomenon surrounding Penacony. Or rather, we are pleased to see that you've been doing that — because the deeper you delve, the closer you'll get to uncovering truth about this so-called "beautiful" dream.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: The Family is obviously hiding something, right? Well we've nabbed some valuable information, and out of the goodness of my heart I've decided to share it with all of you. Although, it unfortunately means your idyllic break in paradise is nearing its end.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: Enter this string of code into your Dreampool — the device you use to dream with — and dive into the hidden map for a look! The coordinates have been sent to you. You just have to copy them over.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: Also, I take it you've already heard about Sam. You should look forward to the meeting. He's a straight shooter who values a fair fight. I think you'll *get along* with him just fine. Don't be overwhelmed by his enthusiasm!
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: Oh, he had me relay a message to you: The curtains have just risen over the dream that can't be reached. The various factions have started to move. I wish you luck! Don't fall behind, Nameless!
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][March 7th]: Those Stellaron Hunters... They even factored Penacony into their plan! Nowhere's safe from them!
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: The situation is clear — the Planet of Festivities isn't what it seems on the surface. Everyone's sights, including the factions in The Family, are set on the Watchmaker's Legacy. Every party has its own motives, and they're attempting to thwart each other.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: While we still don't know what this legacy entails, it's only a matter of time before the power struggle ensnares innocent bystanders.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: The Molten Knight, Sam, is reportedly a remnant of Glamoth's Iron Cavalry — a genetically engineered warrior. He possesses superhuman perception and acts decisively — he'll leave no margin for error. This individual is every bit as dangerous as Kafka and Blade.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: This message is a threat. The hidden map that Silver Wolf mentioned is probably the sealed dreamscape Hotel. For the sake of what's to come, a visit seems necessary.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Should we inform The Family?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: We may be on amicable terms, but that doesn't mean they trust us... Let's act first and talk later.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: What if we get found out...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: It could be a Stellaron Hunter's trap...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: Which is why I didn't suggest it initially. But the way things are now, the Astral Express has a reason to join the fray.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: If The Family asks, just tell them that the Express is investigating the Stellaron Hunters — I'm sure they'll understand. We'll plan our next move according to how they react.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: Then we are in agreement. Let's return and inform Miss Black Swan.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: Miss Black Swan, the Express is willing to cooperate with you — we need a proper guide to navigate the Memory Zone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I'm at your service. I will not disappoint.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: and March, return to your own rooms. Enter the dream, and if everything goes without a hitch... we'll see one another at the dreamscape Hotel's lobby.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Welt]: I'll stay in the real world to ensure everyone's safety. If needed, I will also parlay with The Family. I assume there's no problem, Miss Black Swan?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: It seems that I'll have a hard time gaining your trust even if I personally did rescue your friends... It's no problem, of course, other than the fact that my feelings are a little hurt.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Himeko]: We're counting on you, Welt. As for us... Let's get ready to see the Dreamscape's true visage.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: :
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: :
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: You look anxious, . Worried about that girl?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: You can talk to me if you've something on your mind. In this world, there's no one who heals the heart better than a Memokeeper.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Thank you for saving me.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I just did what I had to do. You are special, after all... So special that many pairs of eyes are watching your every move.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Can you confirm Firefly is safe?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Don't worry. That is a one-way door leading to awakened reality. Unless that girl is so stubborn that she refuses to wake up from the dream — which isn't possible — she must be holed up somewhere in the hotel massaging her eyes right now.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: To be honest, I don't really trust Memokeepers.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: It appears you've had some unhappy memories... But it's obvious that this partnership makes the most sense to you, me, and the Express Crew, no? So you can take it easy and trust me.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Of course, I'm not the only Memokeeper who has come — Penacony has opened its doors to factions beyond The Family for the first time, and the Garden must record this historic moment...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: So you can try working together with others as well... As long as you can see them, hehe.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You're not returning to your room?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: No. I will accompany you into the dream to prevent harm from befalling you all. Memokeepers don't need a Dreampool anyway.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: That's all for now.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: All right. Drift peacefully off to sleep, and I'll be right with you.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: :
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: This way, darling.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I feel fine.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: That's good then.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I don't feel so good...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the Dreamscape than others. This is also why I have to accompany you.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I shall use my methods to relieve you. Don't worry, as your companions are safe — I had both of them each give me a trinket before I entered the dream. This will allow me to feel their presence in the Memory Zone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: They're already awake in their rooms. Will you be comfortable in following me now? Time waits for no one. We must hurry to the lobby.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: :
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Your memories tell you this is March 7th's room. Unless fate intervenes, she will "awaken" here.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: March, are you there?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You knock, but there's no response...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Are you in there? We are about to set off.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You knock again, but there's no response...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: March? It's me, ...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You knock harder, and there's still no response.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I know what you're thinking, but alas... That girl isn't in there, and neither is this her room.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: The moment you stepped into the Memory Zone, reality's building structures lost all meaning. I can sense that she is in a faraway place right now.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: In the meantime, if we want to find that lobby the Navigator mentioned... we'll have to try a little harder.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: These poor little things stumbling about...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Strange, there appears to be someone else's presence here...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Ah... Her? How is this possible?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Are there... no staff members here at all?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Huh? What're you doing here?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You... lost your way again?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Well, not really. I just don't know where I am.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You... know each other?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Yes. She is the Memokeeper I mentioned.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: We'll have to cut the banter short... Let's first work together and remove these overly friendly children, shall we?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: I'm indebted to you both for your help.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Finally, some peace and quiet. What are the two of you doing here?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: We could ask you the same thing.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: It's a long story. I fortuitously — as  should remember — became friends with some of the Bloodhounds, and was helping them track down a wanted criminal... Except I ended up here for some reason.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: It's probably not as complicated as it sounds. It's all thanks to... a Masked Fool. Maybe I unwittingly hurt her... and then in a flash of kaleidoscopic light, I ended up here.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Penacony's rife with rumors now, about the Watchmaker, a legacy, nightmares and other mysterious tales. I was curious as to who was spreading them, and tested the method as described in the rumors... To think I actually ended up here...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: You... aren't hiding anything, are you?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Hiding? I don't think I'd be capable of that in front of a Memokeeper.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: That's true.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I can.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Is that so... You're good then. What sort of training did you have to undergo? Can you teach me?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: 's kidding.  can't do it.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: How about in front of me?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: That's not what I meant. It's just a... figure of speech.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Your arrival is timely — this Dreamscape is fraught with danger. Since our destination is the same, how about we join forces?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: I can protect you from harm, but in the Memory Zone, I'll need assistance from the Memokeeper as well. And... if we run into The Family, it wouldn't hurt to have one more person to explain the situation.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Hmm... What do you think, ?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Never hurts to have more people.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: We can trust Acheron.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I think we should forget it...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Sorry. I couldn't hear you clearly. Could you repeat that?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no problem.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no can do...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Sorry. I couldn't hear you clearly. Could you repeat that?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no problem.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no problem.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: :
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: No, absolutely not.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Sorry. I couldn't hear you clearly. Could you repeat that?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no problem.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no can do.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Sorry. I couldn't hear you clearly. Could you repeat that?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no problem.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I mean, no problem.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: :
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Thank you, ... I'm truly grateful.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Glad to be traveling with you again, Miss Black Swan.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Mm... I truly hope so.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: This door... can't be opened?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: It's locked. I can travel through it freely, but you all...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: We'll just have to take the way I came. Follow me.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: This way... is blocked as well.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: This room... Why is it upside down?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: The Memory Zone is constantly shifting its form. Looks like we'll have to think of a way... to walk on the ceiling.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: We're standing on the ceiling right now.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...Miss Acheron's words speak sense. Regardless, we have to reach that flat surface hanging overhead. And we're not scaling the pillar, of course.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I'll teach everyone some traversal tricks used in the Memory Zone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: How about it? Can you feel the memoria flowing around you?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Next, find a suitable spot... and try *walking up* the wall.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: ...It worked. You really can walk up walls.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: A Memory Zone of this level is mere child's play to a Memokeeper. Come on. Let's head out through the front door.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: This is... a dead end.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: You're a natural, aren't you? You're a prodigy at Remembrance, .
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: We've arrived. There's an elevator here, just like in the lobby. We should be able to reach our destination with it.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: But the Memory Zone up ahead... appears to be severely twisted. Be careful, everyone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...See, I told you it wasn't going to be that simple. Where is this?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: This door... is locked too?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: There's no end to this. Let me try.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You see the Memokeeper close her eyes. She is searching the room in an almost telepathic way, even every nook and cranny outside the room.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: This Memory Zone... is overly twisted. I have to use inelegant methods, so you two... please give me a little time...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Mm... got it. I can see the core of this Dreamscape, and there are members of The Family... and some figures trying to find their way forward. It appears that your friends aren't faring too well... One, two, three...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...Wait, three? There is a third person seeking the way to the lobby? Wait... it's...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...The girl who was with you?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Firefly? What's she doing here?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Could you be mistaken?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You said she already returned to reality.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: It eludes me, but there's a known semblance in the Memory Zone, mirroring the essence she radiates... What reason does she have to delve so deep into the Dreamscape?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: She... Is she running? No... Running away? Something's right behind her...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...This is not good. Everyone, we must hurry.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: There's no time. I'll just have to break the rules and use some methods to help you phase through the Memory Zone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I picked up slivers of her thoughts in the Memory Zone. These will help you form an impression of her. Now, you must hang on to these thoughts with all your might, and shape them in your mind.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I caught some very familiar memories just now — she's not the only *old friend* who has appeared here. There was also a third party at the scene when you ran into danger...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...That Memory Zone meme, it is here as well.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: I have this right... Don't I...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: The Watchmaker's Legacy...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][???]: I... won't give up...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Hurry, through here.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: ...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: The gate shuts. Your thoughts, stirred by the swirling current and pulled along, descend into a deep abyss, sinking. When the hatch opens again, what sights will you behold? Perhaps no one can provide an answer.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: An indescribable fluid — darkness — flows from your chest to your throat. Suffocation engulfs you from within. Then, a voice emerges...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Firefly]: In my dream, I saw a scorched earth, and a new sapling emerging from it. It bloomed against the morning sun, and whispered to me.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Firefly]: Why do people choose to sleep? I think...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: The final sigh escapes, its origin unknown.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Firefly]: ...It is because they're afraid to awaken from the dream.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: ...Watch out! A dangerous presence lurks nearby.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...Everyone, be on your guard.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Firefly]: S—Sorry...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: , you... you all right?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: What just happened?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Is this... a dream...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: , look at me... Calm down, deep breaths, all right?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...Allow me. Relax, you'll be fine.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Don't worry. I'm fine.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: That... that was too sudden...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I'm really sorry, but I have to leave for a short while... Death still hovers about, and I must personally ensure Miss Himeko and Miss March 7th's safety, and warn them...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: I'll leave  to you... Miss Acheron.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: I'm sorry for what happened... I was too focused on that girl, and got sloppy...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: It was my hesitation that caused her to lose her life... I'm sorry, .
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: It's not your fault.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: But if in that moment, I chose to draw my blade...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You didn't even draw your blade... Why...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: ...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Sorry, I... had no choice.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: The priority is figuring out what happened.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Yes... Yes, we will. But not yet. Before The Hunt, we should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: She didn't have a choice either...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: I understand your anger, and I will accept it... but this isn't the time. We should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Do not let pain dictate your thoughts, . Compose yourself, and you will walk the right path.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Once, someone said to me: "No compassion for the enemy, for that is cruelty upon yourself. But you must see clearly who the true enemy is..."
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: ...And then, with one swing of your blade, you must understand its meaning and the price you pay.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: This is the only advice I have for you, from someone burdened with a blood debt.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: ...I'm back.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: , Miss Himeko has something to tell you... There's good news, and bad news.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: The Memokeeper hands over a Memory Bubble, signaling for you to press it against your forehead. You do as instructed, and a bone-chilling coldness pierces your body, which then consolidates into a clear image.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You see Himeko and March 7th together, obstructed by The Family. Black Swan stands beside them, unnoticed by the The [sic] Family.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: I understand the situation now. Please take  and retreat to a safe location. If time allows, you can investigate Firefly's matter first. Meet later at Clockie's statue.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: Memories in the bubbles come to an end here.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Which is why I must undertake Miss Himeko's request and bring both of you back to reality. ... I'm glad to see that you're fine. Let us reach a safe place before speaking again.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Miss Black Swan, do you not intend to open some sort of... teleporter?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Mm... I don't recommend that.  mental state is unstable, so we have to avoid any *rough* traversal methods like just now.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Also, while we're departing, we can still do more for Miss Firefly, can't we? Some remnants of her presence linger nearby. Seize the chance to etch them into your "Remembrance" before they're gone.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: ...If we can start investigating on the way, that'd be good.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: Let's go. We have to find another path...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Sorry, but could you give me a few more minutes?
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: I... have some unfinished business.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You watch as Acheron turns away. You remember that it was there that she dissolved into a mere illusion.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Narration]: You see her pause, lips pursed, eyes downcast. After a moment, she hunches down, as if gathering something with her hands, and rises again.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Should One Awaken at Midnight 2.mp4
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: May death be the end of your boundless dream...
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: Guiding you back... to the waking world.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Acheron]: ...Let's go.
[Should One Awaken at Midnight][Black Swan]: This way, follow me.

[Whodunit][Black Swan]: ...What's going on? Why is it... getting hot in the memoria?
[Whodunit][Acheron]: You've noticed it too. Like something is burning...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: These are all... charred remains?
[Whodunit][Acheron]: They're still smoldering — the culprit can't have gotten far.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I suppose we can slow down for now then...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: They're all just *burning* Remembrances... a stark contrast to this deep sea.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Careful, these traces are fresh. Our unsought guest isn't far away.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Not there. Come back.
[Whodunit][Narration]: The remains of this creature bears narrow and deep incisions, with evident traces of charring inflicted by intense burning. A few sparks dance and flicker within, resembling shattered stars departing towards IX.
[Whodunit][Narration]: :
[Whodunit][Narration]: The remains of this creature, pierced by an unknown weapon, reveal inner tissues that have been seemingly evaporated rapidly due to intense heat. You cannot approach any closer — the steam escaping from the shattered body would undoubtedly scorch you.
[Whodunit][Narration]: :
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Something's off. These traces are fresh. Someone just left the scene... Would this person have anything to do with what happened just now?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Just listen to your gut — you were the one who said that... the Remembrance doesn't lie.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: From the memories of these carcasses... that person was tall, and much stronger than an adult male. The method was clean and crisp, all one-strike kills — maybe a mercenary, or an assassin.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: He entered through the door from the lobby, and went farther into the hotel. If that's the case... he should have seen everything that happened here...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: ...I take back what I said. We have to hurry to that Memory Zone where Miss Firefly's presence was imprinted. Considering what this person can do...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: If his goal is that place as well, there won't be anything left there.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: You two, this way. I'll try to create a stable shortcut for you.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Look... Upon leaving the lobby, the structure has become chaotic. Phase through that corridor, and be careful — do not alert the meme.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: This is truly... a magnificent sight. It's this room, then?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Yes. More precisely, it's right below.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Right below?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Exactly what it means: Down.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Doesn't look like there's a way down.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I wouldn't call it a shortcut if there was.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Are you going to teach me to phase through walls now?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: You two may not be able to phase through physical structures like Memokeepers, but I've got a great idea that will let you safely reach the floor right below this room.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: It's really easy — see this chandelier? Next... we want to create some reasonably *small movements*.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Still remember what I taught you? Feel the flow of the memoria, walk up the wall, and then... get close to it.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Look, a solitary chain. Go say hello to it.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Look, it's common sense and easy, right?
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Are we... jumping down from here?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Don't worry, I'll do something about it. Let me stack the dream bubbles to give everyone a nice, soft landing.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Okay, here we go...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: We landed safely. This is... amazing.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Don't imitate the Memokeeper without the accompaniment of one! Well...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: ...wouldn't it be lovely if these nosy newcomers found their way back home?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: No one will disturb us now. Here, how about I show you a little magic trick?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Not there. Come back.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Are you ready? Don't be too surprised.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Is that... Firefly?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Yes. It's what this room left behind — the memories of her. The slight trembling of the ground, the fleeting reflections on the screen, the flow of memoria... I gathered and reproduced them in fragments.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: As for the context... we'll need to sort that out a bit. Hurry along now. Recreating memories on this scale takes quite a toll on me.
[Whodunit][Firefly]: That thing I encountered with  back then...
[Whodunit][Firefly]: If I'm not wrong... it has to do with the Watchmaker.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: She mentioned your name.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Thinking of you even in your absence, seems like you two were pretty close.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: She seems to be sharing her discovery with someone, and... it's related to the Watchmaker.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: She has no idea that she'll become a victim...
[Whodunit][Firefly]: If I could try again...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: She stares at the screens. Is she looking at herself in the mirror? ...What does she mean by "try again"?
[Whodunit][Firefly]: Let's get going...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: "Let's"? Is there someone else?
[Whodunit][Firefly]: Calm down, Firefly... Stay calm...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: She seems... very nervous.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Yes. What is making her so nervous?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: With all this in mind, Firefly and her companion — there should only be one — have entered this corridor together.
[Whodunit][Firefly]: Why did you...!? This isn't what we agreed on...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: The situation has changed, and it seems that companion... has deviated from the original plan.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Perhaps, judging from the outcome... this is that person's true intention.
[Whodunit][Firefly]: Mecha...!? Why...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Who forced her to go that way? And...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: "Mecha"... What an intriguing statement. I recall the Bloodhound family is pursuing a criminal — "a tall male in silver armor."
[Whodunit][Firefly]: The door... It won't open... It's a dead end...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Based on these fragmented pieces of information, it seems Firefly's companion betrayed her halfway and trapped her alone in this room, disappearing without a trace... But why?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: She mentioned that this transaction involves the Watchmaker, and that often means stepping on many people's toes.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: They might have had their eyes on the legacy, or wanted to silence another who knew too much. Or, there could be a deeper secret tucked away in this Memory Zone, and to hook that elusive prize... one needs the right bait.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Do you mean... Firefly?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: This is just the worst-case scenario. But think about it: If the mastermind behind all this is nearby, why would he let us look around freely? Unless...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: ...there is something else he cares more about and needs — or should I say, is verifying.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: She had no other way to leave but from the side corridor.
[Whodunit][Firefly]: There's actually a path here...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme... She was completely lost in the Memory Zone.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme... She was completely lost in the Memory Zone.
[Whodunit][Firefly]: It's an exit... Following this path should lead me out of this place...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "Death."
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "Death."
[Whodunit][Firefly]: Finally back at the lobby. If that's the case...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: She thought she had escaped but...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: ...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: She thought she had escaped but...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: ...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: After that, it's the end...
[Whodunit][Acheron]: Everyone, over there—
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: It seems like someone has been awaiting us. Ready to step into the spotlight now?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: ...Stellaron Hunter: Sam.
[Whodunit][Acheron]: ...Careful.
[Whodunit][Sam]: A Galaxy Ranger...
[Whodunit][Sam]: And... a Memokeeper
[Whodunit][Sam]: Leave now, and nobody gets hurt.
[Whodunit][Sam]: Or else...
[Whodunit][Sam]: All of you will die here.
[Whodunit][Sam]: The detective game is over. You shouldn't be here.
[Whodunit][Sam]: I will... set the seas ablaze.
[Whodunit][Sam]: Once you're back in the real world, remember to tell everyone —
[Whodunit][Sam]: About the Stellaron Hunter who was behind your ultimate departure.
[Whodunit][Sam]: If that's the case—
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Leave the dance stage to them, my dear.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: ...what a show.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Thank you for your efforts, Memokeeper - quite a brilliant move to pit enemies against each other.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: When I first saw the Ranger and the Hunter together, my heart skipped a beat... I never thought you'd successfully trigger a conflict between the two.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: As promised, I've delivered the child to you. Our transaction is complete.
[Whodunit][Narration]: What is happening...
[Whodunit][Narration]: You two are in this together...
[Whodunit][Narration]: Black Swan, you...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Haha, looks like our Nameless friend over here is still confused. Let me explain.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: In short, you need to thank this lady here, my friend. Not only did she not betray you — on the contrary, she rescued you...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: ...from that "Galaxy Ranger."
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Right, I do enjoy seeing that shocked expression of yours.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: My friend, let's be honest. That woman named "Acheron" isn't as simple as you thought. Did she say she's a Galaxy Ranger?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: ...She's actually an Emanator, who brings death and finality.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Acheron has her peculiarities, but...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: But? There's no but. This is the truth.
[Whodunit][Narration]: An Emanator? Whose?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Perhaps The Hunt... or Destruction... or even Finality. It doesn't matter, these Paths all point to the same outcome.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Impossible. Why should I believe you?
[Whodunit][Narration]: No way. Acheron was right there at the scene. It couldn't have been her.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: She was there? Wait, what... You're kidding... Oh my, this just got even more interesting.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Let me give you some IPC insider information, my friend. Do you know "Duke Inferno" — Fetora's Ifrit?
[Whodunit][Narration]: I fought him before.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Nicely done, as expected! I'll cut to the chase then...
[Whodunit][Narration]: Who?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: You don't seem to have heard of him before... He belongs to the Annihilation Gang, so I guess it's normal. Then let me explain to you...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: This Duke Inferno is a Fire Demon from Fetora. He's an energy lifeform, and it's rumored that his birth is related to a certain genius...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: He and his thugs formed "Ever-Flame Mansion" and viewed Nanook as their savior — in actuality, they were led by this duke to go around burning and looting, practicing the will of Destruction. And even the other Annihilation Gangs weren't spared.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: I'm not sure what The Family was thinking, or perhaps someone was scheming behind the scenes, but shockingly these characters received an invitation. And why would the Ever-Flame Mansion decline? They harbor fierce intentions, swearing to turn the Planet of Festivities into a sea of blazing flames...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: But there's no need to worry. They won't be able to attend. Do you know why?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Because Ifrit is dead.
[Whodunit][Narration]: What happened?
[Whodunit][Narration]: As I expected...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: They were eliminated while on their way. The assailant, demonstrating remarkable expertise, ruthlessly ended Ifrit and swiped the invite that the Annihilation Gang had in their possession. The Ever-Flame Mansion disbanded, each going their separate ways...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Thereafter, a mysterious Galaxy Ranger arrived on Penacony, checking into the hotel with only a music box... Do you still need me to continue the story, my friend?
[Whodunit][Narration]: It was Acheron...
[Whodunit][Narration]: It doesn't rule out others.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Do you have any other evidence?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: The Galaxy Rangers come and go like shadows, and there's little communication between them. Her story is almost too perfect. If she remains silent, there's no concrete evidence against her. While the IPC can investigate, it'll take some time.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: So, my friend, the choice is yours now... You can leave this place immediately, without looking back, and forever forsake the chance to get closer to the truth.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Or, you can accept my invitation and learn a truth, a truth potent enough to upend everything in Penacony.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: I need your help, so I'll wait — but not for long. Once you are ready... follow me.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: As for aligning with me, see the truth first, then decide... you'll still have time.
[Whodunit][Narration]: :
[Whodunit][Narration]: :
[Whodunit][Narration]: Aventurine isn't here. You know that, and so does he. You can also choose to turn around and find out what the facts are directly from his mouth, but if you insist on going forward, that signals a "rejection."
[Whodunit][Narration]: Leave directly.
[Whodunit][Narration]: After careful consideration, you decline Aventurine's invitation. This time, he simply watches as you depart from the Memory Zone without asking you to stay.'
[Whodunit][Narration]: Returning to reality, you reunite with your companions. After a thorough discussion, the Crew decides to assist Penacony, leading to the revelation of a conspiracy orchestrated by the IPC.'

[Whodunit][Narration]: Let's go back and find Aventurine...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: My, my... you look like a small injured animal. Are you still willing to talk to me? Of course... I'm still willing to be your psychotherapist.
[Whodunit][Narration]: You betrayed me?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I admit I'd made a transaction with that gentleman to bring you before him. But... this is also a safe place.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: He needs you. It's essential if we want to reclaim Penacony. Recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, I opted to join forces with him.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: In Penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes... that includes me. I can't deny this, nor do I seek forgiveness.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: But do you still remember? I said... "I have faith in your potential," and that's not a lie.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: The Garden of Recollection wants to witness the future of the Astral Express Trailblazing the cosmos, and as for these memories — I will treasure them. I do not have reasons to hurt any of you. Instead, I will continue to assist you — provided you are willing to accept my assistance.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Can I trust Aventurine?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: My take on this might surprise you.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: In my view, he's a trustworthy individual. Not for any other reason, but because he's an exceptional businessman. In this vast universe, no one values honesty and contracts more than a merchant.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: But, always be on guard, particularly when making agreements with him. Scrutinize the details. Beyond the confines of the contract, your rights are off his radar... He'll go to extreme lengths to ensure his advantage.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Who do you think is the mastermind...?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I still believe that Miss Firefly's situation... is deeply connected with the Stellaron Hunter, just as we speculated. But as you've heard, Aventurine has his finger pointed at the Galaxy Ranger.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I can't fathom why he'd draw that conclusion, but given his access to the IPC's intelligence network, we should seriously consider his perspective. Moreover, I believe Miss Acheron is also hiding something.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: ...No, in fact, I should say, she's hiding everything from us.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: It was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. With regards to the Annihilation Gang... I can also prove that what Aventurine said was the truth.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: That's why, during this golden soirée... she is the dance's centerpiece.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Are you willing to bring me out of this Memory Zone?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Why of course, but now's not the time.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I know you're confused and... sad. Whoever that girl might have been, a living soul, a "memory" that was meant to last... she simply vanished, like the dissolution of bubbles in water, disappearing in an instant...
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: No matter what, I hope you can trust Aventurine — or rather — trust me and see the "truth" with your own eyes. This can lead us deeper into the secrets behind Penacony.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I will protect you. Once I gather more information from him, I'll make sure you're safely returned to your companions.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: For the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices... It is the right choice.
[Whodunit][Narration]: You're right. Let's go.
[Whodunit][Narration]: How would I know you're not trying to frame me?
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Perhaps he plans on doing so, but I won't.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: The Garden of Recollection has eyes everywhere. If he wants to hurt you, he'll have to fight against the Memokeepers — I've warned him about that.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Later, I'll stay by your side as a memetic entity, just in case. Time to set off, .
[Whodunit][Narration]: :
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Are you still... continuing down this path? This is a rare opportunity. Leaving here... will also mean leaving the truth.
[Whodunit][Narration]: You're right. I can't leave.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: Yes, I [sic] better think about Aventurine's proposal.
[Whodunit][Narration]: I've decided. I'm leaving this place.
[Whodunit][Black Swan]: I see... Fine, I respect your choice. Let's return to reality.
[Whodunit][Narration]: After careful consideration, you decline Aventurine's invitation. This time, he simply watches as you depart from the Memory Zone without asking you to stay.
[Whodunit][Narration]: Returning to reality, you reunite with your companions. After a thorough discussion, the Crew decides to assist Penacony, leading to the revelation of a conspiracy orchestrated by the IPC.

[Whodunit][Narration]: Script SupervisorElio
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Excellent, I knew you would come. By the way, about that Memokeeper... Never mind, I won't press the issue further.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: I've said before, you can liaise with your companions, or even twist the narrative against me. I'll wholeheartedly embrace it! It signifies your potential.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: I don't do deals where I'm on the losing end. So, my "friends"... don't let me down.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Please, this way if you will!
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Oh right, I remember mentioning something after that... What was it again?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Ah... a familiar hallway, a familiar room. Do you remember? The last time we met was right here.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: This is it, just beyond this door. Take a deep breath and get ready.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Oh, I remember... my friend! After that, we played an enjoyable game.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Tell me, doesn't this feel eerily familiar?
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: I remember everything now. This was what I told you at that time...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Look, friend.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: The game has already begun.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: Allow me to make you an offer — one you can't refuse.
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: No reason to choose otherwise...
[Whodunit][Aventurine]: ...and no other choices.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: ...
[Whodunit][???]: Brother, I'm back.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: ...Welcome back. How's your preparation for the performance coming?
[Whodunit][???]: It's fine. Don't worry.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: "It's fine"?
[Whodunit][Sunday]: Hmm, this is not good... You're the pride of The Family. Don't let those unnecessary emotions affect your perfect pitch.
[Whodunit][???]: I... know.
[Whodunit][???]: Brother, you seem to be in low spirit... What's happened? Is it because of the Watchmaker's guest list?
[Whodunit][Sunday]: Yes, I received the report that... "Death" had taken some of them. Perhaps someone was behind it.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: Ah, I'm sorry. I forgot you just came back. You probably wouldn't know about it.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: Somehow, a nightmare called "Death" has descended upon Penacony, striking indiscriminately, bringing spiritual death to all equally...
[Whodunit][Sunday]: In the utopian dreamscape envisioned by The Family, such sorrowful incidents shouldn't arise. It profoundly undermines the equilibrium and serenity of the dreamscape... How detestable.
[Whodunit][???]: I can't believe this has happened. Was... someone killed again?
[Whodunit][Sunday]: Yes. There were two. One was a stowaway, the other...
[Whodunit][Sunday]: ...was you.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: That's enough Fool. Your deeds have saddened me.
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: Pretty sharp, aren't you, Chicken Wing Boy?
[Whodunit][Sunday]: The Odes of Harmony talks about honesty — "The words of a fool begins with foolishness and end in treacherous arrogance"...
[Whodunit][Sunday]: ...Please leave. THEIR dreamscape doesn't welcome you.
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: Oh come on, lighten up! Why so serious with all the quotations and references?
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: I'm just curious — Now things have come to this, is The Family still unwilling to fight? I mean, your darling sister's already a goner, right?
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: Really? Don't tell me you're not craving a little vengeance.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: It's not yet time. When the fated day arrives, I shall mete out justice with unyielding righteousness.
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: Wow, you can endure that much? Truly, a heart of ice you've got there. Hey, maybe we could actually get along?
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: How about this? I'll stand in for your dear sister at events — surely you don't want the world to hear the Charmony Festival's been called off?
[Whodunit][Sunday]: The Family has a plan, and do not dishonor my dear sister with your deceitful tongue again, Fool.
[Whodunit][Sparkle]: Alright, alright~ Just putting it out there... If you're ever in a pinch, remember I've got your back. I mean, who could resist a guy rocking spikes on his wings?
[Whodunit][Sunday]: There's no need. The malefactor has been exposed under THEIR radiant gaze and will soon fall by their own machinations.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: Should the transgressor fail to turn away from this path, THEIR sword will be honed, THEIR bow strung, causing the malevolence the perpetrator spreads to befall them.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: When that time comes, the heathen will realize they are but a mere mortal, doomed to descend into the netherworld.
[Whodunit][Sunday]: ...And I will join THEIR vanguard to announce this good news to you personally, "Watchmaker."

[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: ...Ah, friend. My expression wasn't much better than yours when I first saw this.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Your eyes aren't deceiving you — it's her, the famous singer Robin.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: But... how is that possible?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Could Robin actually...
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: First of all, can I just say that this had nothing to do with me. I'm just an unlucky bystander here. The Family can testify for me. If you don't believe me, just ask anyone in the Bloodhound Family — they hate me, and they hate the IPC, so they'd never lie.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: This is not where the crime happened. What I showed to you was a "memory" — the most basic Light Cone manifesting tech, authorized by the Garden of Recollection and owned by the IPC.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Did you really think the Galaxy Ranger was an outsider this whole time?
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Penacony has made a solemn commitment to protect the safety of anyone inside a Family dream. Any person in distress will be forcibly awakened and safely returned to reality.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: What gives them the confidence to make such conclusive statements? Because behind this promise is the Harmony: The Family's Dreamweavers link up their minds together to construct an unbreakable defensive line.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Breaking through this line of defense to create "Death" in the dreamscape... Not even a Memokeeper could do that without The Family's permission.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Who could have done it? Friend, the only one is her, the girl who calls herself a Galaxy Ranger... An imposter, an unsought guest, an Emanator who hides her true identity...
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Ifrit's death was a foregone conclusion, and Robin... her misfortune was staring right at her. Who will be the next to die?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: This really is... hard to take in.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: That's just one side of the story.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: If that's the case, I can't trust anyone.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: It's fine. Listen to your gut. Building trust always takes time, and I'm willing to wait.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: I just hope you realize that wherever that legacy is concerned... covert plans are already underway throughout Penacony. Everyone's got their own agenda.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Careful you don't get stuck on the wrong side. If I were you, I'd keep my distance from Acheron. After all, any schemes out in the open are always going to be better than a monster in the shadows... right?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Who's to say there isn't an even deeper conspiracy lurking beneath the surface?
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: ...Memokeeper, I think our little deal is finished.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Aventurine is telling the truth. This "memory" is a real one, and there's no sign of any distortion grafting on.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: The IPC is not the Garden, and there are real limits to what they can actually do. But you know all this.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Friend, let's not beat around the bush here — the thing is, I want to reach out personally to team up with the Astral Express.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: I told you, I'm just not interested in scrambling for "the Legacy." I just came to Penacony for work. I'm here to retrieve some lost property for the IPC, if you catch my drift... I'm talking ownership of this "frontier prison."
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: This has all become a bad debt thanks to the Cancer of All Worlds. The IPC has tried sitting down for negotiations time and again, but The Family wouldn't even take our calls.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: You have no idea how difficult these people are to deal with. Put it this way — they've hushed up the existence of "Death" before, so they can definitely cover up any news about Robin's death.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: It'll just quietly float off like a bubble and pop, nobody ever being the wiser...
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: That's not fair, right? So then, friend, I need your help.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: What kind of help?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: I've got something on right now.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: That's fine. I'm not forcing you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: But I'm really not asking for much, so why don't you at least hear me out, okay?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: I can't trust you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: That's fine. I'm not forcing you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: But I'm really not asking for much, so why don't you at least hear me out, okay?
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: I have but only one goal: The Family's front door is like a high wall, and to tear the whole thing down I'll have to dig out a few chunks first. Once I find a weak point, the IPC will have plenty of means.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Now we have our chance. So long as we can get to the truth behind her death, we can have justice for Robin while also gaining a valuable bargaining chip for bringing The Family to the table.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Truly a once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity... I've been investigating and making lots of friends all over Penacony precisely for this very moment.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: This tragic news would be extremely bad for The Family, so they'll be doing everything they can to stop it leaking — especially to the IPC.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: But I trust there are still a few factions that remain exceptions, and that's why I need you all. The reputation of the Astral Express precedes you, and the Harmony will give you the fairest of appraisals.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: You get to find out really what happened and seek justice, and I get to put it toward completing my mission for the IPC... It's what you call a win-win situation.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: You want to take advantage of The Family's trust in us?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: The Nameless would never associate with the IPC.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: A decision like this is way above my pay grade...
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Don't worry. Just head back and talk things over with your companions.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: That navigator is really smart. She must understand the value of this deal. Look, here's my contact details. If you come to any conclusions, call me.
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: Oh, and... take this! A thorough investigation can always use a little more funding. Don't mention it!
[The Devil in Velvet][Aventurine]: So long, friend. I really am looking forward to uncovering the truth about "Death" with everyone.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: :
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: ...What now? What are your plans?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: :
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: On the surface, this doesn't look like a bad deal for you. But Aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won't just be as simple as it appears to be.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: He doesn't know about Miss Firefly yet — but judging by your reaction, he may have noticed something going on and deliberately shifted topics to the "Truth of Death" to try and pull you in line with his way of thinking.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: That's quick thinking, and very sound logic. Aventurine is no fool. And working with him definitely has its dangers.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: The Nameless cannot turn a blind eye to evil.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: But you're talking about REAL evil.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: For Firefly's sake, we must get to the bottom of all this.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: That... is something I agree on.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Playing it safe seems to be the smarter move.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. But what about the long-term?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Can I toss a die to let it decide for me?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Leaving it up to fate? It's just how that gambler thinks.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Anyway, be careful out there. There's more than one way to blaze a trail. In a dark forest beset by wolves ensuring your own escape to safety should be your primary concern.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: As for the other questions...
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Did "Death" kill Robin?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: I'm not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound... looked like its winged blade. We've all witnessed it in action before.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Plus... it seems unlikely that there would be two lethal entities loose in the dreamscape.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Do you think this is connected to Acheron?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Sorry, I can't answer that question. That ranger is shrouded in mystery. I'm afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: But without a doubt... she is the most "special" guest at this banquet. It's like Aventurine said just then. It's best to keep your distance from her.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Have you noticed anything else unusual?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span... In and of itself, that's very unusual.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Two possibilities: The collapse of Penacony's Dreamscape has started speeding up, making "Death" extremely agitated and weakening The Family's protections. Or, everything has been planned out and executed by someone.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: If someone has chosen these victims deliberately... First a stowaway, then a Family celebrity... Then this murderer's motives are worth thoroughly chewing over.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: I don't have any other questions.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: It's all happened so quickly I can only make conjecture. After leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. I hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Black Swan leads you through the chaotic Dreamscape...
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Come, this way — it's a short walk. Don't get lost.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: This way... This is where we part ways. All of this is like... a nightmare.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Unfortunately, the Remembrance doesn't lie... What we just saw is the "reality" that happened — and it won't fade from our minds just because we wake up.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: But follow your heart and don't be afraid. We all walk through this world casting shadows of different lengths, and ultimately... all we leave behind are precious memories.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: ...Ah, hold on just a sec.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Black Swan gently touches the root of your ear, leaving a cool sensation. Then, she hands a card over to you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: There you go, a small parting gift. If one day, you unfortunately fall into the deep waters of the Memory Zone and there's no Memokeeper to join you — hopefully it can guide you on my behalf.
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: I also pay great attention to the ways of the world... Just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Thank you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: That's it?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: Then... I've something private to take care of regarding that Galaxy Ranger. Let's leave things there, shall we?
[The Devil in Velvet][Black Swan]: What fascinating memories will you bring for me next time we meet...? I sincerely look forward to them.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: :
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: :
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Some time ago — Deep in Memory Zone
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: Better unsheathe that blade now.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: Ranger.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...Do you still dream, hunter
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: of those slain by your hand?
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: Days ago — Ever-Flame Mansion
[The Devil in Velvet][Media]: Trailblaze Mission The Devil in Velvet.mp4
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: ...
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: ...It appears the outcome has already been determined.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: They're still alive, as are you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: You still have room to make a choice. Leave the music box behind, and then go.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: Choice? The bloody trail of the Destruction leaves no room for hesitation.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Fetora's fire demon... Even if you sacrifice your life for that Aeon, you won't get special treatment.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: Ranger, you tread the narrow Path of The Hunt. You could never understand.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: We come from the fire, and are born bathed in fire. We spread, burn, and destroy until all the kindling has burned out, and we leave only ashes on the ground.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: Burning forms the entire life of a fire demon, from the beginning to the end. We are born to die, just to put into practice a profile of another universal truth: All things are created for the Destruction.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Your companions don't seem to think so. They fight for your chance at survival.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: They are my children and, just as I was, they are flames that have yet to burn white-hot. They're still young and I don't blame them.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: But my flames are faint and time is running out. Can you see the Planet of Festivities in the distance? I plan to bring purgatory with me there — and before that, I must surpass you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Why?
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: Because on the path THEY have forged, you have traveled farther than I have...
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: ..."Emanator."
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: You cannot hide your true identity. Draw that sword, for we shall indeed remain here, bound to fight a decisive battle to the death, for I choose this.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: Destruction is intense but brief. To cravenly cling to life is to endure an endlessly prolonged existence.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Even if the answer... turns out to be your own destruction?
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: What's important is not the answer, but that it exists — just as you exist. Everything exists to be destroyed — Emanators are no different.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: Just as even sweet dreams may be born of the void, the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...Alright. I accept.
[The Devil in Velvet][Duke Inferno]: You shall witness the most brilliant and intense fire in existence. May this flame illuminate the farthest reaches of your bottomless dream.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: A bottomless dream... Yes, that's right. But you've made one small mistake.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: This blade remains in its scabbard not out of pity or scorn. It's a personal secret that I don't want to disclose, but perhaps out of reciprocity...
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: She says this as her hand gently rests on the hilt of the sword.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...I'll reveal the truth to you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: The Hunt... is not the path I truly follow.
[The Devil in Velvet][Narration]: ...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: May death be the end of your boundless dream...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...guiding you back to the waking world.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...I still see them in my dreams.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Hold it. Your time hasn't come yet.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: ..."My time"?
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: I've seen many clever disguises that can conceal appearances, but they can never cover up who a person really is. And you're no different.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: You had no desire to kill . You only did what you did to drive me and the Memokeeper away... but why?
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: ...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Did Destiny's Slave make you do it?
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: You know Elio.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: I thought this is just the kind of thing that'd get written into your "script."
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: My "script" has always been brief. Other than that. Anything beyond that is unnecessary.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: He knows my nature: There is but a single destiny, from which no one can escape... And until then, I hold the privilege of choice.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: However, you appear to be ignorant of this, so it's time for me to inquire: Who exactly are you?
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Not your enemy, perhaps.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: That's not what I asked.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: I don't deserve your curiosity. Loners wandering the cosmos always have their secrets. Take me. I've also been wanted by the IPC, so it's little wonder I know something about the Stellaron Hunters... that's all.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Maybe I can help.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: What reason would you have for doing that?
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: I tend to forget things — which is why, rather than memories, I'm accustomed to using my emotions to capture what I normally wouldn't otherwise. So...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...I know who is inside that cold armor.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: ...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: How about it? Ready to take off that armor and sit down for a talk?
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: It's not yet time.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: I don't need help, but I can give you a suggestion that would make things better for you and me.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: If your goal is the Watchmaker's Legacy, then go look into The Family. Not only are they covering up the existence of "Death," but they're burying the past and the truth about what happens inside the Dreamscape.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Already on it.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: ...and the Astral Express is no enemy of yours.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: I know that... I just never expected to hear you say it.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: What's next, then? 's been taken by Black Swan. Will you go look for ?
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: No need for that... No harm in mentioning that Elio's only given me one instruction: "Get all of the Astral Express to track down the grand legacy."
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: I tried settling this in an easier and more direct way, but as you can see, here I am, confronting you: I failed. Can't ever go against "the script."
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: "The so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen"...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...That's it. Before we split, can I ask you one more thing?
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Is there anything else in your "script" about me? I'd like to know what kind of footnote "I" get to leave in that future foreseen by destiny?
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: Unfortunately, not a thing came up.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: ...I knew it.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: Hang on...
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: I don't.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Don't what?
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: Your first question was: "Do you still have dreams about everyone who died because of you?"
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: I don't. Never have.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: I was born without the ability to "dream." I live for this cold harsh reality, for a little light, and to burn... to keep on burning, until I turn to ash.
[The Devil in Velvet][Sam]: So, I really envy you.
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Is that so...
[The Devil in Velvet][Acheron]: Then you're already living in the waking world.

[Lost Generation][Narration]: Present day — Golden Hour
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: We heard about Miss Firefly from Black Swan... But we never expected Miss Robin to...
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: I'm sorry... that I couldn't be with you then.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Reality cruises on in serenity, while undercurrents bubble up from the Dreamscape... just like that Memokeeper said...
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...Stay strong, everyone. We can still do what we can for them... starting with finding the murderer.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Let's recap everything then.  just reminded me of something: March, do you remember what that Family rep who negotiated with us said?
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: "Indeed, we trust that the Nameless has nothing to do with this, and we also beg each of you to help assist The Family in verifying the identity of the deceased." That's how it was put... in reference to Miss Firefly.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. And he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: The Family is planning on covering up all news about Miss Robin's death. If news gets out, Penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath...
[Lost Generation][Welt]: But the murder that followed closely after was obviously beyond their anticipation. The Family had to try and turn things to their advantage by bringing in reinforcements from outside. The Charmony Festival is nearly here — they must be snowed under.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: It may also be that Miss Firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: After all, the nature of the two murders is fundamentally different... The Family's first protective measures should be against malicious actors among the guests, such as that IPC envoy.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: He really is up to no good.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: All the while accusing that Galaxy Ranger...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Aventurine is on guard against Acheron.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Indeed, he was particularly concerned about that Galaxy Ranger.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Are we missing the forest for the trees here...? I always felt that Aventurine's reasons for accusing Miss Acheron were highly subtle. Can we believe him?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: At this point, I'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Look, let's try to gather intel first and then list all the possible outcomes we can. Then we go through them, eliminating contradictions one-by-one. The fewer facts remaining, the closer we are to the truth.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...I've still got this sense of foreboding. It's like we're stuck in a whirlpool — spinning around that Legacy even after everything that's happened...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: This time we're playing the role of a real detective... But before we start, what are we going to say to The Family and Aventurine?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: As I see things, The Family harbors no ill-will towards the Astral Express — if they didn't trust the Crew, they wouldn't have casually commissioned outsiders to investigate a case that's in all likelihood "a scandal."
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Plus, this is The Family's turf. Teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: As for that Aventurine... Welt, I'd like to hear your thoughts.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: He's complex. He deliberately slow-played his hand during negotiations while running circles round us all the while.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: He appealed convincingly to both reason and emotion. It wasn't forced, but the intent was obvious.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Still, it's good to have contacts among all this uncertainty. Aventurine showed his skills, and as far as our interests are aligned, he can become a reliable ally.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: We also need to keep a certain distance from The Family — never let them get too close. Teaming up with the IPC helps balance that out — if either side makes a move, we have the option to pull out.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: So you suggest accepting Aventurine's proposal to team up?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Yes... It's risky, but we can only wait until both sides have played their cards before making any further judgments.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: I get why, but there's a whole lot of bad guys and girls around here and I'm worried about getting stabbed in the back.  has been bullied a few times now, and I can't stand it anymore...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: It's fine. Let's focus on the big picture for now.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: You're like a broken record...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: It's fine. I got a lot out of him, too...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: You...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: ...No! I can't accept this!
[Lost Generation][Narration]: It's cool. You can bully me whenever!
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: You...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: ...No! I can't accept this!
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: ...Forget about it. Just let me keep an eye on him! If that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Then , could you please reply to Aventurine? Everyone, take this time to put together your thoughts.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: :
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Aventurine's goal is to try and recapture Penacony for IPC. To do this, he'll have to bring down The Family in its entirety to create a big enough chance.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: The existence of "Death" will be covered up by The Family, so how does he plan on taking them down? It's got to be something important enough that everyone will notice, but it also can't be anything too out-in-the-open...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Perhaps he's going for the Hotel?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: An attack on the hotel guests? Unlikely. Penacony's guests include quite a few big wigs known throughout the whole cosmos, people who not even the IPC would dare take lightly. Aventurine is a shrewd merchant, and there's no way he doesn't know that.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Perhaps he's going for The Family?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: He's definitely going for The Family, and it's just a matter of how. The Harmony is strong in Penacony and almost impossible to take on head-to-head. The fact that the IPC dispatched Aventurine shows that they do not intend to simply play by the book here.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Perhaps he's going for Acheron?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. But this Galaxy Ranger... we know hardly anything about her and can't rush to any conclusions.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Perhaps he's going for the Astral Express?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: ...I was also considering this possibility, especially... because he respects you so much, and has sought you out before a few times. Perhaps he's also unsure of your intentions, and is probing you.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: No conclusions can be drawn just yet.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: ...I'm just speculating. In any case, we have to be careful when handling Aventurine. He's skilled at reading people and discerning the right moment to strike. Also...
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: He's clearly a born gambler if he's willing to go all in to win.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: If Aventurine wants to bring down The Family, he'll have to create a big enough chance. After everything he's done so far — what is his goal...?
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: I hope it's not too soon to bring it up, but I feel like... Miss Robin isn't actually dead, but that she's still alive and well somewhere. That everything's just some... horrible prank...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Because... aren't we supposed to be inside a dream? How could someone die in a beautiful dreamscape like this... Shouldn't only good things happen here?
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Whenever I see the grand theater, I just can't stop all these thoughts from flooding my head...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Do you think The Family is behind all this?
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: No no, after all they've brought everyone this sleepy dreamscape which everyone loves. I just feel like I'm starting to understand them less and less...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: We'll restore all the dreams back to normal.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Yeah! Of course, at times like this we're so lucky to have our Crew. The Family and the IPC — everyone has their own plans going on...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Everyone's still having a great time out there on the streets. Nobody knows what's happened... It's all so unreal, as if Firefly, Miss Robin, and us... were all outsiders from another world.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Ahh... what a mess! I really want a nice cool drink of soda to help me calm down...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: But then I'd be just like everyone else out on the streets...
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: This dream... is becoming more and more separated from reality.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Aventurine said something that concerns me...
[Lost Generation][Welt]: He accused that Galaxy Ranger of killing Robin without any evidence whatsoever... but said nothing about her connection to that Memory Zone Meme, or why he was stalking you.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: It was a groundless accusation... which only serves to make him seem more suspicious.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: But why, though...?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Does Aventurine have other plans?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: He's bluffing.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Maybe Aventurine's goal was never to gain our trust. Maybe he wanted to foster a feeling of enmity toward Acheron and make the situation more volatile... Two birds, one stone.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: However, I asked Dan Heng back on the Express to confirm that story about the Annihilation Gang and the lost messages... It wasn't something that Aventurine made up out of thin air.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: You've met her many times, now. What's your impression of Miss Acheron?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: ...She's a very gentle woman?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Weird... I can't seem to remember.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: ...She's a very mysterious woman?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Weird... I can't seem to remember.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: ...She's a very powerful woman?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Weird... I can't seem to remember.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Weird... I can't seem to remember.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...That fits the stereotype of a Galaxy Ranger to a T.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: They're eccentric, unpredictable, and fond of being alone. No wonder she's a suspect.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Whatever happens, please don't place all your trust in Aventurine. We cannot afford to be manipulated by him.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Looks like Aventurine doesn't need anything else — let's turn our attention to The Family's assignment for now. Himeko, what do you think?
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Among our current clues, the two murders that  witnessed are the most directly connected. I suggest starting here.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: One thing I'm curious about is, if a person dies in a dream, what happens to them in real life? Seeing as we're at The Family's behest, why not pop back out to reality and verify Miss Firefly's situation back at the hotel... Perhaps we could also make a few inquiries about Miss Robin while we're out there.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: How about we split off into two groups? There are still some things worth focusing on inside the Dreamscape — I'll investigate those and we can link up again later.
[Lost Generation][Himeko]: Worth focusing on? ...Oh, no problem. I'll leave it to you then.
[Lost Generation][March 7th]: Huh? Ah... I thought I'd finally get to see Himeko and Mr. Yang go out on a mission together. Oh well, take care then, Mr. Yang!
[Lost Generation][Welt]: I will. Keep in touch.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Honored guest, could you come out for a second?
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: I'd be embarrassed too, getting stared at like that.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Forgive me. My name is Welt Yang — I'm one of the Crew Members on the Astral Express. I believe you've met my colleagues.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Welt...
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...Is there something about my name?
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: ...First, don't you want to know my name?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: I already do, Miss Acheron. You're a prominent figure in Penacony.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: ...What are they saying about me?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Some claim that you're the real culprit behind these murders... that the Annihilation Gang's tragic fate at the banquet was a result of your blade... and that you're now attempting to unleash another bloodbath on Penacony.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: The Annihilation Gang?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Ifrit of Ever-Flame Mansion.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: "Tragic fate"... That duke turned his dying body to flames and sacrificed his life as a martyr. He was a determined and heroic Pathstrider. Not even a villain should be disparaged like this.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: And what's more, there were plenty of suspects invited. Do they really think... that a blade is more dangerous than that "black hole" you're wielding?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...Keen intuition. Not even The Family managed to point out the truth behind this cane.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: So you must surely know, Miss Acheron, that peering into a black hole is not a wise move. As a potential threat, your knowledge of us has reached uncomfortable depths...
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Reveal your true identity and intentions... Otherwise, brace yourself for gravitational disintegration.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: That shouldn't be necessary... but if it makes the Nameless feel less defensive, I'll be happy to abide.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Believe it or not, Galaxy Ranger, Acheron... those are the names I go by to this very day. My trip to Penacony is solely to fulfill an old "final request."
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: I'm here for the Watchmaker's Legacy... and that's it. I think I've been honest enough.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Still unwilling to reveal your true identity?
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: It's not that I don't want to. It's just that I can't... I've come so far, and I can't sum up all of that in just a few words.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Everyone has their own unspeakable past, secrets that they don't want to be revealed... and I won't be asking any more questions, such as why the Astral Express is roaming around the cosmos with a Stellaron on board.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Is  okay? That Memokeeper... didn't do anything, right?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: 's fine. Let's stick with the topic. Gaining my trust all depends on how much you're willing to reveal.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: I've run around many different Penacony dreamscapes just to try and find that "Legacy," and during this period I came into contact with quite a few guests. In the process, I gradually came to realize...
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: The secret of Penacony... may be closely related to the Trailblaze.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: That's why I've come to ask for your help. I don't have enough proof yet, but I'd like to speculate something: the source of all tragedy lies within The Family. If you could trust me... we could find the proof to support this claim, together.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Mr. Yang, I think you've come to the same conclusion, haven't you?
[Lost Generation][Welt]: ...Let's leave it at that. For now, I'll choose to believe that you bear no hostility.
[Lost Generation][Welt]: Share your findings with me, and me alone. I don't want vague conjecture to interfere with other people's judgments before we find solid proof.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Mhmm.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: ...By the way, would you like something to drink? Before we go, how about two cups of Wake the Heck Up...? No, four cups.
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: Because the conversation coming up... will last forever.
[Lost Generation][Narration]: At the same time — Hotel in the real world
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: I've been watching her closely for a while now, and the first "invitation" was in the banquet hall of the hotel.
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: She just sat in one corner keeping silent, chugging down a couple cups of Wake the Heck Up... I told her it's a pungent, bitter beverage, not the taste of sweet dreams — only for people allergic to SoulGlad. And she said...
[Lost Generation][Acheron]: "Really? But I don't taste... any difference at all between them."
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: The guest rooms are charmingly minimalist...
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...An aesthetic you share, Miss Acheron.
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: It's a cinch. This music box — the "invitation" received by the Annihilation Gang... There are latent memories that linger on it yet.
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: You see, memories of you are not yours alone. They travel in other people... Other things. I know much, and I can predict even more. With some help, the dead can be made to speak.
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: The Annihilation Gang, that band of desperadoes who all disappeared after meeting you... What exactly happened to them? Well, let me reveal all.
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "...Gradation twelve ██ Dreamscape twelve ██ Father ██ I dedicate this to you..."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "...Well done ██ Dubra ██ wherever they go, ██ shall be met by annihilation..."
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...There it is — it's hazy, but it's Ifrit's voice. The other one... is probably his progeny.
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: This is the residual memory from when the 'invitation' was first delivered... they were abruptly interrupted. Then, what happened next is...
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "...They sought refuge in the land of sleep ██, merely wishing for undisturbed rest, away from the storms..."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "Children of the flame ██ this marks your rite of passage."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "She won't be necessary ████ I alone am enough."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: Shh—████ when have those ██ on the Path of Destruction ██ feared death?
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: The Ever-Flame Mansion has set out on a journey. Those poor people... They have no idea what lies in wait ahead of them.
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: Memory recovery is going well, but slowly. She'll be here soon, and time is short.... There's nobody else here, so there's no need to be delicate... In fact I think I'd better go all out....
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...What happened?
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "██████████ ██████ ████████████████ ████████"
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: The memory after that... is blank? How is that possible... This music box fell into Acheron's hands, and she brought it to Penacony — that's a fact, and that's how it should have gone... but along the way...
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "█████ █████████ █ ███ █████ ████ █ █████ ███ ██ ██████████ █████ ██ ██ ███ █████ █████ "
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...It's like it's been erased? Who's done this...
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "██████████████████████████ ██████ "
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "████ Who █ ██ are ███ you █ █"
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "...Who are you?"
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...It's?
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: No — is this not a "memory"?
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "Oh... a Memokeeper. Do you serve the Garden of Recollection... or The Cremators?"
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "My name is Constance... A pleasure to meet you. We were supposed to meet in Penacony and spend an... unforgettable time together."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "But that seems unrealistic. Dahlia's not welcome on the Banquet Star, and I don't need a coming-of-age ceremony... And you, I know what you're looking for..."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "Want 'her' secret? I can give it to you, and then... you can enjoy the banquet for me."
[Lost Generation][Voice in the Memory]: "I wish you 'unforgettable' memories."
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...
[Lost Generation][Black Swan]: ...A phone? Want to listen in?
[Lost Generation][Narration]: At this moment, on the other side...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Switching to Aventurine's POV...
[Lost Generation][Narration]: Aventurine now has an understanding of the present situation. He's decided to honor the Oak Family head's invitation and meet the man, then reclaim his lost belongings as well as the power fitting for them...

[Double Indemnity][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "A few days ago, the IPC made an announcement..."
[Double Indemnity][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "Under the watchful guidance of the Marketing Development Department and in accordance with the Interstellar Peace Charter, the independent Sigonian Sovereignty has hereby been established, and shall take a legislative seat at the Interstellar Congress..."
[Double Indemnity][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "The formation of the Sigonian Sovereignty is of great historical significance to the Sigonia system: This move puts an end to the planet's long and bloody history, turning the sensational Katica-Avgin Extinction Event into a distant memory..."
[Double Indemnity][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "Sigonia-IV is located in an unclaimed zone at the intersection of the Dnies, Pruthian, and Dorneau star clusters. The planet's surface environment is known for being extremely harsh, constantly faced with the threat of impact from small-scale celestial objects..."
[Double Indemnity][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "This is why very few intelligent species have made this planet their home. Dividing themselves into several tribes to eke out nomad lifestyles as they struggle to survive the arid desert wilderness, they have developed their own folk beliefs that are independent of the Aeon belief system..."
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Double Indemnity 1.mp4
[Double Indemnity][???]: ...Sigonia, Sigonia. Ravenous eye of the storm, spurned by all the gods...
[Double Indemnity][???]: Land of rock, but not water, lightning, but not rain, blood, but not tears. You beat us with your falling stars, you lash us with wind and storm, you chew us up with the cracked earth...
[Double Indemnity][???]: You promised us a land of honey, yet yoked us beneath a sword of bitterness. O, Gaiathra Triclops, if Thou can hear me, please open up thy three eyes and gaze upon this child...
[Double Indemnity][???]: When you took his father, my child was still sleeping in my belly. And where my husband went, I too soon must go...
[Double Indemnity][???]: I don't ask for a peaceful death, just for you to tell me — does the baby swaddled sweetly asleep... does he dream of his mother's heartbeat and the sound of falling rain? Please tell me whether this life is all just a fleeting dream...
[Double Indemnity][???]: ...Otherwise, why would this child be born to face impending death...?
[Double Indemnity][???]: Mommy...! Mommy...!
[Double Indemnity][???]: Mommy...! The rain — it's raining!
[Double Indemnity][???]: Raining...? Raining...
[Double Indemnity][???]: It is raining! It's true! Those outworlders weren't lying to us. They really did summon the rain... Mommy, we can leave here... We can go back home!
[Double Indemnity][???]: Back home... Ahh... Gaiathra Triclops, you came. Do you hear that? Thank you... Thank you...
[Double Indemnity][???]: Darling, listen... this is the sound of rain. On the day you were born, the sky also sent down a gift like this from Gaiathra.
[Double Indemnity][???]: Such a lucky child, such a blessed child... Just like your name. A gift from THEM to Avgin... my boy...
[Double Indemnity][???]: "May the goddess Gaiathra close HER eyes three times..."
[Double Indemnity][???]: "Keep your blood eternally pulsing..."
[Double Indemnity][???]: "Let your journey be forever peaceful... "
[Double Indemnity][???]: "...and your schemes forever concealed."
[Double Indemnity][???]: ...Welcome to this sad world, Kakavasha.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: ...
[Double Indemnity][???]: Time to wake up, gambler.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Oh!
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Oh heavens, I must have drunk too much SoulGlad... Didn't expect you to be back so soon. How is it... find anything?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Just as you guessed: Nobody outside knows about Robin's death, there aren't even baseless conspiracy theories. They're still streaming the rehearsal for her ceremony — using a stand-in, I guess — *ahem* they must be dreaming.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Of course. Who could imagine that death would actually descend upon the idyllic dream created by The Family, let alone that the victim would be the female lead of the Charmony Festival...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: To be honest with you, I didn't believe it and even tested it a few times myself — until I discovered that I couldn't actually die. Whenever there's any danger, I'm forced awake by the Dreampool and it's all as if everything were just a nightmare.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: That's why I'm convinced that there are a few big secrets lurking behind the scenes.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Then you must have heard about the Memory Zone meme — when I graciously deigned to establish connections with the Oak Family on your behalf, they were quite in a pitiful state of disarray.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Besides Robin, there was another body. I don't know the exact details, just that it was a stowaway.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Two murder cases!? I told you, something seemed off about the Nameless.  must have come across the other one...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: This murderer is a psycho... but I have to say, the case does represent an opportunity. We can leverage The Family's malfeasance and let the IPC use this as a reason to intervene.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: It's just that their trickery runs deeper than I thought. Robin's stand-in was all ready to go... These two murders are definitely getting hushed up.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: What should we do? Let me think... It's too rare an opportunity to miss out on, so I gotta be careful...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Incredible, gambler. Have you already exhausted your limited repertoire of tricks so soon?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: There are plenty of chips, but it'd be best to choose carefully. The most straightforward... has to be Robin. Remember? That Masked Fool once told me to find a mute as a friend.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Robin is what she calls the "mute." She has lost her voice and while most people can't pick up on it, you and I cannot mistake that sound — not produced by any voicebox, but rather by the resonance of the Harmony.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: If that girl hadn't gone hoarse from singing practice, there'd only be one possibility: Something was up with The Family, or Robin herself. To get to the bottom of this, I tried every way I could to meet her...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...but she died, right before my very eyes.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A complete and utter loss — incidentally, it seems to have resulted in your rather undignified arrival on the interrogation stand.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: There were eyewitnesses at the scene, and The Family, in their graciousness, has tentatively accepted your alibi. However, for the foreseeable future... you shall, regrettably, find yourself under the vigilant watch of the Hounds.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Things aren't looking too optimistic, Doctor. I'm starting to break out in a cold sweat. Do you reckon... there's still any chance of a comeback given how things are?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A probability? Yes, it exists, but it verges on the infinitesimal. To phrase it in a manner more befitting the vernacular of Penacony, "you're dreaming."
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: But if you simply can't control yourself and want to try your hand, then there just so happens to be a suitable candidate...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That man wants to see you again.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Who?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Sunday.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Is this a public hearing, or a private trial?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If it were the former, it would hardly befit my stature to stoop to the role of a mere messenger.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Fine... That's great. It's all great. You see, the dead can't talk — but the living can...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Ratio, I'm convinced now that there must be something wrong inside The Family. Just you wait and see, that man's sister has died. He can't sit on his hands.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Without any further ado, let's set off — lead the way! The show... is about to begin.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: We're here. The Dewlight Pavilion is the Oak Family's fortress and a place where heads of the families meet to discuss great plans for Penacony.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Fortress? I like this metaphor. I had dealt with the warlords of the Iymanika star system not long ago, and their synchronized orbital manor wasn't this heavily guarded.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: This mansion nominally belongs to Sunday, and is very befitting of its owner. Without his express invitation, the likes of ordinary guests would never grace these grounds in their lifetimes. Look around while you still have this moment of freedom.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Hey, Doc — Whose side are you on anyway?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Who's to say I won't sell you out?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: We'll see. When we meet the authoritarian master of the Oak Family, I'll pry an answer out of him.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Follow me, and I'll bring you to his parlor. Hold your tongue and let me deal with the members of The Family.
[Double Indemnity][Hendrick]: Hey, you two! That's a place of business. No entry!
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I was requested by Mr. Sunday to bring him the suspect. My name is Ratio. He should've mentioned it to you.
[Double Indemnity][Hendrick]: Oh, I remember you... Veritas Ratio. Your "Punch Virtual Particle Clock" is impressive.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...Excuse me?
[Double Indemnity][Hendrick]: The one on your head! Of course, it's nothing compared to my... full pocket-dimensional annihilating power armor of the "Mobile Knights."
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Right, and as I mentioned, that fantasy raiment of yours doesn't exist.
[Double Indemnity][Hendrick]: That's because you can't see it! Like I say, only Family can see the glory of the "Mobile Knights." Enough, get going. Don't keep Mr. Sunday waiting.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: *sigh*... It seems like the idiocy index here is no better than it is out there.
[Double Indemnity][Hendrick]: Enough, get going. Don't keep Mr. Sunday waiting.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...A dead end?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The door is shut tight. Looks like we're on our own.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: I mean... there isn't a door. How did you get in before?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: For security reasons, The Family built the administrative site deep in the Dreamscape, with the mechanisms hidden in these Nightingale statues. The direction of the statues can be controlled.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: On the previous occasion, an attendant named Conna had gone to the side room to verify something before setting the statues in the correct positions.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Maybe we should do the same. Let's go and take a look. Of course, we can also use brute force.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Solving a problem by brute force doesn't prove your intelligence. The side room — don't let me repeat myself.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Look, like I said — brute force can also solve things.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The Council of Mundanites should consider you as their member, for no one in this universe is more suitable to be there than you.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Six Nightingales facing in different directions — an obvious hint.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Hmm... but are these Nightingales?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: They are. What's wrong?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: How can Nightingales be so huge? They look more like Torment Eagles to me.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: There are no eagles in the Five Families, only Nightingales— Why am I wasting time with you on this?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: The two return on the path they came from...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Just as I thought, here's the correct answer.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: A truly miraculous discovery — perhaps I should offer you the chance to join the Genius Society?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Really? I thought you'd given up on that already.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I was being sarcastic. Can't you tell?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Impressive. So much for Mr Sunday's reserved, virtuous image.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Do you need me to remind you? We're in a dreamscape. No matter how grand the mansion looks, it'll not affect Penacony. Stop wasting your time nitpicking The Family here.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yeah, you're right. The only way to destroy The Family is "Death." Sunday must have thought the same. Let's head down.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...Hold on.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: What's wrong? Are we heading the wrong way?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: No, but this door is locked.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: My friend, did you really make an appointment with him?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...It's a trial. You got to prove your worth to Sunday before you can speak with him.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If I'm not wrong, we need to find a way to open this door in the hall, or this place will be our prison.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Oh, an escape room — my favorite.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Get serious. I've no time for games. Let's head back. The hint is probably in that prominent sandpit.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Get serious. I've no time for games. Let's head back. The hint is probably in that prominent sandpit.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Wow, that's an enormous sandpit... I'd love to build a tall building for myself once I have enough savings.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Look, there's a noticeable gap in the model. I believe you're right.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: There wasn't a gap before. That man must have done it intentionally.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: With your brilliant mind you shouldn't have any trouble recalling what was here last time, right, Doctor?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Of course.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Let's look around. When I see it, I will know it.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Fine, fine. Why do I feel that we're pursuing a degree in burglary now?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Found it. This is it.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: The nameplate reads: Gulliver's Arch. I'm amazed you can remember something this tiny. You know, this reminds me of a tunnel I once saw that could shrink people who passed through it.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If I were you, I would shut my mouth. It's wise to remain silent when you should.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: The two return to the lobby...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Insert Gulliver's Arch into the slot.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: This reminds me of one of those building toys. With the blocks? I've never played with them before. I wonder if it's more interesting than stacking chips.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Look, the gap is closed, and it fits perfectly — eh, so what's next?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Waaaaaah...!
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Good heavens. Did I shrink? Am I still in a dream?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Indeed.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Doctor... you're huge! It's me! Down here in the sandpit!
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Actually I think we could make this work for us. Just find a way to slip me into Sunday's collar, and I'll infiltrate The Family just like that.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Fine. I was just kidding.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Let's find a way to open the door.
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Hello. Welcome to the Golden Hour base model.
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: I am an Oak Soldier. I will be here to guide you through the tour of the base model. Happy to be of service.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Tell me about the guided tour.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Then tell me about the tour.
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Hel—l—l—l—l—o. Welcome to the Golden Hour ba—a—a—a—a—se model —
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: I am an O—o—o—o—o—oak Soldier. I will be here to guide you through the to—o—o—o—ur of the base mo —
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Hey, I was talking to you.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Tell me about the tour!
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Model. Happy to be of service.
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Gen—n—n—n—n—n—nerating guide. Please wait pa—a—a—a—a—a—atient—t—t—t...
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: t-t-t-t-t...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: You seriously are the worst soldier.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Tell. Me. About. The. Tour.
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: ...Fo—o—o—o—und the nearest check-in spot!
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Please lo—o—o—o—ok behind me — a capsule m—a—a—a—a—chine model—
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Mode-e-e-e-e-e-e-l—
[Double Indemnity][Oak Family Soldier]: Ah!
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: After screaming, the soldier collapses — he didn't even have time to earn a five-star rating from you.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: What's up with that? Now The Family's toys are trying to frame me? I didn't do a thing to it, Doc. You've gotta be my witness.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I saw nothing.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Capsule machine... There's no mechanism on the floor. Could there be one at the top? Doctor, do me a favor —
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: So I was right. These models have interiors that look exactly like the real buildings. The only difference is that no one lives in them.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Funny that Sunday puts a miniature that makes him seem like a giant by comparison right where he can see it first thing in the morning. Insecure much?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: One of the fragments flew upstairs. I'll need to use the pinball machine to flick myself up there, but it's tough.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Great. There's another pinball machine base here, and it's empty too.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Doc, I'll need your brainpower again.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: There's no need to yell, I can hear you. The pinball machine must be hidden somewhere in the hall, like the arch. Wait here, and I'll be back in a minute.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Finally, a moment of peace.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Quite a fascinating contraption. I would rate it more favorably if that clamorous little person inside were gone.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Ratio... I can hear you...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Doctor... Shake a leg...?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Without that Pinball machine, neither one of us is going anywhere anytime soon.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That's it... Pleasant moments of solitude are always fleeting.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Ha, you're back! Just place it here... Thank you...!
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Place the model in the sandpit.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Thanks, Doc!
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Ratio, you should come in and take a look. The view here is breathtaking. Honestly, you could easily squash me with just a pinch.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: If that is your wish, I will do so without a moment's hesitation.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: All done. Piece of cake.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: And the joyous tour of Toy City has come to an end. It makes me feel sad.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Penacony isn't all bad, right? I'll use this interesting experience as a talking point at the poker table.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: It's a pity you made it out of the sandpit alive. Sunday is just beyond this door. From my limited understanding, he's not someone easily handled. Are you prepared?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yeah, only I believe he's the one who should be prepared to face me.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Tell me about your plan.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: I don't have a plan. I'll just play it by ear. There are only two kinds of bargaining chips when dealing with people: Benefit or fear.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Looks like "sincerity" isn't in your dictionary.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Am I not sincere enough? There's no need to emphasize it. We've got to make good use of death. That man's sister is dead. He won't be able to turn a blind eye, and that's "fear."
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: And I'll help him find the murderer. He can't do it due to his status and position, but I can, and that's "benefit."
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: On what basis do you believe he's incapable, necessitating the delegation to someone from a rival faction, the IPC?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Simple — Because that murderer could very well be a traitor hiding inside The Family.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...Do you mean the Galaxy Ranger whom you accused previously?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: That was just an excuse, good doctor. There's something wrong with that woman, and we need someone to keep her in check. It's better to minimize the variables outside of our control when we execute our plans.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Moreover, I need to know her identity. If I'm lucky, she could be an important pawn. And it's good to have more helpful friends when dealing with this matter.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: But honestly, the murder case is likely unrelated to her. I believe my standpoint: There's a rat in The Family. Otherwise, why would Mr. Sunday arrange a private meeting with us? This isn't an interrogation, but a secret negotiation.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: We'll see. Using Robin's death as a bargaining chip, I'll win back my freedom and power. In the end, I'll ruin this beautiful dream and create the grandest death.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: If the chance of winning is just beyond this door, even if that chance is close to zero, well... you can't win if you don't play, right?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, the charming audacity! To think that you, of all people, might emerge victorious, dear gambler.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Three chips are enough.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: All or nothing.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: It seems my puzzles are too effortless for you, IPC Ambassador.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: I appreciate your words, and I see you put a lot of effort into welcoming me, Mr. Sunday. However, this is no way to greet a guest.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Well, this isn't an invitation, but a summoning. Before we speak, I need to test your character.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I imagine this knowledgeable doctor friend of yours has been of great help, yes?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Certainly, you ought to know this better than I do — he has already faithfully fulfilled his duties, hasn't he?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Yes, the doctor has assured me of your noble character. He considers you, like himself, a virtuous person who can be trusted by The Family.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I have come to know you very well as a person, Mr. Aventurine. You're diligent, generous, and willing to cooperate. The fact that you succeeded in overcoming many obstacles just to meet me gave me the reason to believe in your wisdom and courage.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: But there's one thing I must ask you — that is, you've used your wisdom at the wrong place to meet the wrong person and put yourself in a situation where you shouldn't be... witnessing a tragedy that shouldn't have happened.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: You don't look too well. Am I making you anxious?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...If not, then it means I'm on your side.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: If I wasn't mistaken, you'd just made a serious accusation against The Family.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: You weren't mistaken, for depravity is creeping in around you.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: There's no need for us to be evasive. Let's talk about your sister. Your sister's talent is unrivaled in the world of show business. As you know, her voice has been out of tune since she returned to Penacony. What's more disheartening, she can't sing anymore.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Who could be responsible for this? Many suspect the culprit is among the outsiders, but I know... you hold a different opinion.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Now, your noble status has become a shackle, preventing you from apprehending the murderer and avenging your sister's death. You're feeling anxious because you're out on a limb.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: But don't worry. I am on your side.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I'm immensely honored by your concern for me, Mr. Aventurine — since you're so selfless and generous, I believe you wouldn't ask for anything in return, would you?
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Naturally, you wouldn't incur any loss from this. I just want to reclaim what is mine: My liberty, and the personal items under The Family's custody — the bag of gift money, and...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: The box in which the Cornerstone is stored.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: That's right.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Cornerstone — I've heard it's a treasured asset of the Strategic Investment Department, a sacred stone that seals the "Preservation" Emanator, granting significant power, and every Liquidation Specialist holds one.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: ...For an object so precious, it probably comes at an even higher price than other forms of recompense.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: I'm sure you're aware of the high level of risk I'll be undertaking to bring the truth to light.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Mr. Aventurine, when you're out and about, do you always make adjustments to your appearance? Your tie should be on the center line, your shirt must not protrude from your vest, your trouser creases should be perfectly straight, and always aligned with the tips of your shoes.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Of course.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: But I don't, because it's not appropriate to do so in public — you should make sure everything is presentable and in order before leaving the house.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I'm not the kind that takes risks. The Cornerstone must be in the custody of The Family.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: No room for negotiation?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Please don't let me turn you down twice.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Sure. The gift money is good enough. I suppose you wouldn't mind that? After all, a merchant can't function without a bargaining chip.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: You compromised quicker than I thought. Unfortunately, it's a gambler that needs a bargaining chip... not a merchant. I can give you your gift money, but before that, I want you to tell me —
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: — The fact that you can decisively forsake the box you asked for, what exactly is stored in it?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Oh, Triple-Faced Soul, please sear his tongue and palms with a hot iron, so that he will not be able to fabricate lies and make false vows."
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...What have you done?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Under the light of the Harmony, all wickedness is revealed. I implore THEM to shed THEIR light, and I'll ask you questions on THEIR behalf. Next... you have 113 seconds to prove your innocence and gain my trust.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: And if I refuse to answer?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: You can try — and we'll see if the Harmony rejects you.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Question: Do you own a Cornerstone?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: What a simple answer. You, too, understand that idle chatter leads only to poverty.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Did you hand over the Cornerstone to The Family when you entered Penacony?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Does the Cornerstone you handed over to The Family belong to you?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Is your Cornerstone in this room right now?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Is your memory free from any kind of tampering or deletion, encompassing but not restricted to the techniques of the Garden of Recollection?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Are you an Avgin from Sigonia?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes. You even know about that?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Do the Avgins have any ability to read, tamper with, or manipulate one's own or another's mind?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: No. Does it matter?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Do you love your family more than yourself?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Yes.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "All the Avgins were killed in a massacre. Am I right?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: No.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Are you your clan's sole survivor?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Perhaps.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "...Do you hate and wish to destroy this world with your own hands?"
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: I don't know.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Interesting. Now, the final question...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: "Can you swear that at this very moment, the Aventurine stone is safe and sound in this box?"
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...Of course.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Looks like we can get an answer.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Open it, Mr. Aventurine... It's your last chance to defend your honor.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Please.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Are these what you're looking for?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: System hours ago — Dewlight Pavilion
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Since you came as promised, learned Doctor... Does this mean that you are willing to take the side of The Family in this farce?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: What makes you think you can convince me?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I've heard you haven't enjoyed Mr. Aventurine's company. I also understand that you're an avid learner who sees the pursuit of knowledge above all.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: In that case, you ought to realize that a competent scholar knows their position and wouldn't forsake more vital matters for the sake of petty pride.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: If you agree to assist The Family, I'll share our research findings on the Stellaron. You must be quite aware that, besides The Family, no other faction is willing to share such information.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Cut to the chase. What do you need from me?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I need Mr. Aventurine's comprehensive plan.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Haven't you confiscated his Cornerstone? You can't expect a featherless bird to take flight.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: But I've also heard the ten elites in the Strategic Investment Department have united, progressing together in the interests of the IPC.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: You'll have to speak more clearly than that.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: The Cornerstone which Mr. Aventurine surrendered — was it really his?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: You question whether he would entrust you with someone else's Cornerstone? The Ten Stonehearts aren't as united as you think — Cornerstones are significantly more precious to them than their very own lives.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: But you know that he's a crazed gambler. The more vocal he is about it, the more cautious I must be.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I never imagined someone would share his way of thinking. Honestly, you should see a shrink.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Bring it. The box containing Cornerstone is unique, and only IPC senior staff and related members can access it — but I happen to be among them.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I appreciate it.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Unfortunately, your guess is correct.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Ha, the golden stone. Its color and glow are similar to that of Qlipoth's body.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: This is the very ruse he intends to use to fool you. He won't reveal to you that the Ten Stonehearts chisel their own will into the Cornerstones, granting them an unparalleled radiance.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: And this golden stone is also known as a topaz, not aventurine, and it belongs to Topaz.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: So? Do you wish to confront him?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Not at the moment. I'm more interested to know the location of his Cornerstone.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The safest place, somewhere you'd never think of. Because he never intended to hide it — in fact, that Cornerstone has been in your hands from the very beginning.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I see, this bag... Mixing a Cornerstone, more precious than life itself, with a bunch of worthless jewels, disguised as a gift of money waiting to be confiscated, is indeed in line with Mr. Aventurine's style.
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Then he makes up some trivial excuse, downplaying the matter, and requests the gift money. This is a gamble, one he's all too familiar with, betting on your single misstep leading to a total loss.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Learned Doctor, I'm grateful for your help. The Family will surely reward a righteous person like you.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: As for the villain... I hope he retreats in humiliation.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: It was all thanks to your friend with a keen eye that I could add a blot of utter failure to your storied career.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Ratio, you wretch...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Finally shown your true colors, heh. Oh, and just to remind you: You currently only have seventeen system hours left to live. Treasure your remaining time, and savor the delectable aftertaste of defeat.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...You might as well explain yourself a little more clearly.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: What I performed on you just now was the Harmony's consecration. You were to show allegiance beneath the illumination of THEIR grace, yet you acted willfully, uttering nothing but falsehoods, transforming the consecration into a trial. I genuinely see no reason to absolve you from it.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Is this what the Harmony represents? Is it built upon constraint and coercion?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: You misunderstand, Mr. Aventurine. Punishment is meant for the irreverent, but I have seen your resilient spirit, and thus I offer you the possibility of a new beginning.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Throughout these seventeen system hours, you will be unable to escape the Dreamscape or contact any of your companions. You only have two paths before you, and it all depends on whether you can complete my test within the time limit.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Should you succeed, you will be able to coalesce into the Harmony and be with your Family. If you fail, you will suffer the wrath of the Eternal Centurion and fall into an abyss of doom.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Sounds like I'm going to end up the same either way.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: I indeed do need a servant to help me uncover the evil hidden in The Family from an external perspective. I will purge the evil from the inside and bring the real culprits to justice within seventeen system hours.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: When the time comes, compare your findings with mine. If both our findings align, or if you can provide me more insights... then THEY will truly be able to grant you mercy and honesty.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: Shameless hypocrites... You took everything from me and still demand the truth? That isn't fair. Your carnival reeks with the stench of cash. Nothing is achievable without it!
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: This is meant to be an act of personal virtue, not requiring The Family's support. Your bag is over there, do as you please. I believe you can trade this bag of worthless jewels for everything you need. That's what gamblers excel at, isn't it?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Off you go, Mr. Aventurine. You are free. I will wait here for your good news.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: This meeting isn't an interrogation, or a negotiation...
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: It's an outright execution.
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: Why would I do that, Mr. Aventurine? I'm just wondering what a passerby who stumbled upon a scene of murder could have found out, that's all.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: By the way, before you go, I have a personal question.
[Double Indemnity][Aventurine]: What is it now?
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: You...
[Double Indemnity][Sunday]: ...Do you truly wish to bring about the destruction of this world?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Double Indemnity 2.mp4
[Double Indemnity][???]: Kakavasha, where did you go... Are you injured!?
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: I got it back, Sister.
[Double Indemnity][???]: You went to look for them...? That's too dangerous! It's just a necklace. It's neither food nor water. We can survive without it.
[Double Indemnity][???]: But I can't live without you, little brother... Promise me not to look for those Katicans again, okay?
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: Sister, don't be afraid. The Katicans are fools, but I'm smart. I played a "game" with them, and I won.
[Double Indemnity][???]: Won? What happened exactly? Tell me.
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: I made a bet with them — the two birds in the desert and me, who will die first? I won.
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: They suspected me of cheating, but I didn't... I won fair and square.
[Double Indemnity][???]: Of course. Of course you'd win... You've always been a lucky child. Gaiathra Triclops must be watching over you...
[Double Indemnity][???]: But that's no reason to push your luck by going up against those... those bloodthirsty, CRUEL Katicans! Have you forgotten how Mom and Dad...!
[Double Indemnity][???]: Look, this is just a necklace. But Kakavasha, you are my only family.
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: I'm sorry, Sister... I thought you'd be happy. Because mom left you this necklace...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: ...There'll be no next time.
[Double Indemnity][???]: It is important, but not as important as you, my dearest brother... I don't blame you, but you must remember what mom said...
[Double Indemnity][???]: Pain and poverty are the trials of Gaiathra Triclops. SHE has also granted us a chance, and that's your good luck, Kakavasha. Your good luck is the most precious wealth we — all Avgin have.
[Double Indemnity][???]: You're a child blessed by Gaiathra Triclops and can lead the clan to happiness. So, always remember to protect yourself and never resent the pain and poverty you're going through... All right?
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: ...
[Double Indemnity][???]: Listen to me, and swear to Gaiathra Triclops.
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: ...Okay. I will swear to Gaiathra Triclops to protect this "wealth"...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: But Sister... If Gaiathra Triclops was really watching over us...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: Then why did SHE not protect Dad when he was swept away by the quicksand...? After all, Dad went to the Katicans' land only to prepare for Gaiathra Triclops' offerings...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: And where was Gaiathra Triclops when Mom was shivering in our arms? Mom was still pleading for Gaiathra Triclops' forgiveness under her breath until the moment she closed her eyes...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: Sister, everyone praises me for being smart, but I don't get it... If every rainpour was Gaiathra Triclops' forgiveness and grace...
[Double Indemnity][Kakavasha]: Then how bad were our sins? ...So much so that we were born in this world of death...?
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: ...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Double Indemnity][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Alley]: Umm, excuse me...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Alley]: I can't seem to find any information on this artist in the Iris Family archives. The photo you provided also doesn't show any matches...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: ...Just as I thought. I'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Alley]: Are you referring to the records when you enter the Dreampool? The equipment will monitor physiological indicators such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature in real time. This data will be included in statistics and handed over to The Family for the screening of any data anomalies. Immediate action will be taken once any illegal behavior is detected.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Is it possible to access these records?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Feels like our every move is being watched...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Alley]: Please rest assured. Your vitals are monitored in case of emergencies, allowing us to wake you if necessary. This is all for the safety of our guests.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Can I trouble you to access the records?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Alley]: I apologize... The hotel does not have access. This information is managed by the Bloodhound Family. We can only gain access if there's a problem.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Looks like nothing can be found here.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: At least we know who to look for next. We can ask the Bloodhound Family for information.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Thank you for your assistance, Miss Alley. By the way... is Miss Robin doing fine? We are looking forward to her performance.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Alley]: "Fine"... What does that mean? Is there something wrong with Miss Robin? The preparations for the Charmony Festival have been proceeding smoothly, so I guess things are pretty good. I believe she will be able to put on a spectacular show for all of you.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Mm, I'm sure.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Sure enough, no one knows about Miss Robin. I'm not surprised.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: But that Miss Firefly is truly mysterious. There's no information on her in the hotel system. Even if she's a stowaway... she should have a disguised identity after entering the planet.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: She's also in the running for the Legacy... How is she going to sneak into the Dreamscape unnoticed?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Is there any other way to enter a dream besides the hotel room's Dreampool?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: The Garden of Recollection...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Stellaron Hunters...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: The Memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. In the Memory Zone of Penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by Black Swan.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: The hacker girl from the Stellaron Hunters used extraordinary means to unlock the dreamscape Hotel's seal. According to the scene witnessed by , it is likely that they are behind Miss Firefly's case.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: The Garden of Recollection... and the Stellaron Hunters, both are possible. But what about the IPC? Since they want Penacony all for themselves, they're bound to have a plan.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Nervous Guest]: Wh—Who are you guys?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: The Bravo team has arrived at their designated position. Ready to execute armed evacuation operation — boys, get moving!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Ar—armed evacuation? Boss, are you drunk?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: What do you know!? It's more efficient this way. Just don't let the director find out! Act first, report later, understood?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Help... Help me... I spent all my year-end bonus on the snowball... I don't want my name on the department's major disciplinary notice!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Hey, , check it out! That voice... Could it be the IPC Workers from Belobog?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Team Leader]: To all guests: The IPC will be conducting special operations within the hotel. Please follow the staff in charge of evacuation to the designated safe zones, or compulsory measures will be enforced!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: I'll request a beating for you lot! You've been told not to drink during work hours!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: Take him back to the hotel room!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: ...I'll organize a meeting later to properly go over how this incident report should be written!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...Miss Topaz! I never thought I'd run into you on Penacony.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: Long time no see, Astral Express crew. Aventurine has told me a lot about your happenings... Hmm?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: ...It's fine. Do as they ask, and try to avoid any conflicts with The Family... Report to me before taking any action. Mhm. Yes, alright.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: ...As you see — the IPC isn't very popular here on Penacony. Cordiality from The Family is a mere facade. The former frontier prison has turned around and cuffed its shackles on the IPC staff now.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: Only Aventurine, who carries an invitation is allowed to attend the banquet. An entourage like us... We can only sit around in the reality Hotel, unauthorized to even enter dreams.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: No wonder Aventurine's scrambling to partner up with someone — the IPC can't back him up in the Dreamscape.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: His situation isn't optimistic, I hear. You're all helping to investigate some... dirt on The Family, are you not? Let me know if you need anything outside the Dreamscape. The IPC always treats its partners well.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Thank you, Miss Topaz. We're on our way to the Hounds to verify some intel. Perhaps you've had dealings with them?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: Yep, they're tailing us right now. Why not go and talk to them... it'll take the spotlight off me, being constantly stared at is really uncomfortable.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: How does it feel to be in business with Aventurine? I bet you're not used to it.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: That's just his style. "All or nothing" is his mantra. He's always cozying up to his clients while egging them on to undertake some dangerous assignment with him... But everyone has their merits, so I won't comment further.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: But Aventurine's luck has always been good. He's always closed all his cases without a hitch, and basically never lost a gamble. Which is why on the issue of retaking Penacony I'm watching with keen interest.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: He's that good huh...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: It works only when all parties' interests are aligned.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: Of course. It's business, after all. What's important is where you're seated at the table.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: As for the two cases... Apologies, but I don't have much info on them either. All I can do is ask you to keep digging for more details.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Topaz]: Please continue to investigate the case. All I can do is sit tight in the real world. I look forward to hearing your progress.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Careless Bloodhound Family Member]: We're carrying out our Captain's orders! Wh—What do you want!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: We made a mistake last time, and we're working hard to rectify it now. We don't have time for anything else! Surveilling the IPC Executive Topaz, ensuring that she stays put at The Reverie hotel during her time on Penacony... We've got the right one this time!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: :
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Remember me?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: We meet again.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Careless Bloodhound Family Member]: I—It's you again... Back for more trouble? We're not afraid of you this time!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: Well? Spit it out! Stop bothering us if you've nothing important!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: So you know each other... , why do you keep running into people you've beaten up before?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: I've got business with your Captain. Where is he?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: That's right. We're investigating a murder for The Family. Can we speak to your Captain about the case?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: I need you to pull some records for me. It's for official business.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: That's right. We're investigating a murder for The Family. May we access the hotel's Dreampool entry records?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: When's our lunch break? Mmm... Hungwy.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Sheesh, why do you keep asking me that? We're in the middle of investigating a murder case for The Family. May we speak to your Captain about it?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Careless Bloodhound Family Member]: Well...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: ...Hey! The Security Officer instructed everyone to shut their traps before he returned from Dream's Edge!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: W—What murder? You'd better stop spouting nonsense.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Careless Bloodhound Family Member]: Th—That's right! We have nothing to report. Please leave!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Looks like they're not going to cooperate. But, they did at least tell us that the Captain is at Dream's Edge...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Why don't we just look for the Security Officer then... It's probably Gallagher, the one  mentioned, right?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: W—We have nothing to report. Please leave.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Such tight security... I bet they're stumped by the case as well.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Gallagher... Gallagher... Where could he be?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Apologies. The Bloodhound Family is running an investigation up ahead. No unauthorized personnel allowed.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: ...Hold on a minute. I think I've seen you before, the gray-haired one.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...How much trouble have you stirred up exactly on Penacony?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: This ain't it, chief. You've got the wrong .
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: That's right! It's-a-me, Clockie!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...You think you look alike?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: How about a clockwork trick?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...Wait, are you for real?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Not possible! It was you the last time, yelling about some clockwork friendship while beating me up with that silver-haired girl!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: I'm not letting you get by this time... Please leave, or I'll have to get on my knees and beg you!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: , what kind of heinous crime have you committed now...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Hold on, Sir... We have documents authorized by The Family that would aid your investigation. If it wouldn't trouble you, could we see this Mr. Gallagher?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Who exactly is this Gallagher you keep talking about? There have been a few people mentioning this name, even the one with the gray hair.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Uh? He didn't send you all here?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: It was the Security Officer who dispatched us. That's all I can divulge.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: He'll do! He's the one we've been looking for!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Sorry, no can do. The boss said that since it's a matter of The Family's reputation, no one's allowed through.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Everyone, please leave. There's really no need for us to make things difficult for each other, right?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: We're really sorry for troubling you. , March, let's think of another way.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Another way... That's it! Didn't  say something about that... What was it... clockwork? That got this guy to change his mind.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Can you perform it again, ? That... Clockie magic!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Just what I've been waiting for!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: But I can't abuse it for evildoings.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: It's not bad if we're resolving a misunderstanding!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Please, !
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Sorry, no can do. The boss said that since it's a matter of The Family's reputation, no one's allowed through.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Everyone, please leave. There's really no need for us to make things difficult for each other, right?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: You and this Bloodhound Family member have met before, and you know he's very upright. But you're also aware that principles sometimes don't matter when a person is in a good mood.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: I'll leave you to it...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Thank you for cooperating with The Family's efforts... and also thank you for not making me actually get down on my knees and grovel.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: You punk... Why can't you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth!?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: The Security Officer's word is absolute law. I've told you: That place up ahead is off-limits, to wind, to rain. Even if the Dreammaster was here, they aren't getting in!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: It doesn't rain in the Golden Hour.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: That's just a metaphor. A metaphor! Don't you get it!?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Even the Dreammaster isn't getting in?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Did you not hear me? Even if the Dreammaster was here...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: ...Uhh, we'll talk about this if the Dreammaster is ever here! And, it's just a metaphor. A metaphor! Don't you get it!?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: I'm warning you, if you keep insisting, I'm gonna have to show you my true power!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Uhm, , he looks kinda angry now. Should we...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Come at me, bro!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Humans never learn...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: You dare defy me and my baseball bat?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Humans will never understand one another...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...Great, even if Qlipoth were here, THEY wouldn't be able to protect him.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: There is no meaning to death in defiance, why do you not understand... Sweet Dreams Troupe, charge! Teach them a lesson they won't forget!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Am I destined to relive this outcome...? Looks like you and I have been plunged into a cycle of despair.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...What's he talking about?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: However, this time, I will sever the chains of tragedy — the only way any of you will pass, is over my dead body!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: He doesn't have to be so melodramatic, does he?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: :
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: The principled Bloodhound Family member has become unusually gloomy... You have to think of a way to get him to lighten up.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts again.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Y—You lot... insist on doing this?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Sorry, but human lives and The Family's reputation are at stake. It is imperative we know everything about the case.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: No, I meant to say —
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: — Do I really have to get down on my knees and grovel?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: If you don't mind...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: I didn't think you were the type who would kick someone when they were down.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: I'll have to decline...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: I... know you don't really mean that.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: If that's the case... I'll just have to acquiesce to everyone's wishes, lower my esteemed head and plead with everyone...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: No no no! No need! Standing is just fine. You don't need to do that...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: :
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: The principled Bloodhound Family member is mired in endless sorrow. As compensation, you have to think of a way to comfort him.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Try reading his inner thoughts again.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Let me see what time it is now...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: ...Woah, it's this time already?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Principled Bloodhound Family Member]: Time to clock out! And no one's gonna stop meeee!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: The highly principled member of the Bloodhound Family laughed heartily and left the scene.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: , this clockwork trick of yours... It's kinda dangerous.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: ...At least he won't be getting in our way again. Let's go find that Gallagher and ask him the intricacies of the case.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: I was wondering what all the commotion was... Oh, it's you guys. Welcome. Since you made it here, what can I do for you?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Hello, Mr. Gallagher, sir. Judging from your tone, it sounds like you were expecting us.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: Hahaha... Miss Himeko, you're too polite. There's no need to call me "Sir."
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: ...Mr. Gallagher, you even know my name?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: Of course I do! You folks are from the legendary Astral Express, and honorable guests of the Watchmaker.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: I had an encounter with this  in the Golden Hour. I remember that little silver-haired girl was there too...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: ...I'm sorry for what happened to that kid.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: That's exactly what The Family has ordered us to investigate.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: We are sorry too...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: This is also the reason why we've come to visit you, Mr. Gallagher. The Express can't just overlook the death of that child, so we've decided to help The Family get to the bottom of it, in the hopes of getting justice for her.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: The Nameless involved with The Family... What an unpredictable twist of fate.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][March 7th]: Why...? What's wrong with The Family?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: It's nothing. On Penacony, everyone loves The Family.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: No matter how much one resists the "beautiful dream," when the time comes, they too will find it hard to let go... Who wants to leave a warm nest? Just idiots, little kids... and inebriated fools.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Himeko]: Mr. Gallagher seems to be getting at something.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: You got it wrong, I'm not.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Gallagher]: You want to discuss the case? Sure, come with me. This is not a good place to talk. Let's go elsewhere.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Step DescriptionOnce again, the focus shifts. Sometimes, you feel as though you're living in a movie — nothing else can explain the constant switch of the point-of-view. Golden Hour
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: At this moment, on the other side...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Even after that chilling tragedy, this dream is still running effortlessly.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Other than The Family of the Harmony, it's hard to imagine any other power in the universe that could sustain a building of such magnitude.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: The Family itself is a huge, perfect building. Like... A living idol.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Each member of The Family sees themselves as a piece of the divine puzzle, revolving around a singular core and a shared ideal. Under THEIR command, they loyally fulfill their roles, offering themselves while also receiving sustenance in return.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Interesting analogy. Perhaps that's why Penacony's "beautiful dream" has persisted for so long.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: But the human body has its limits, and so does the divine's.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: That doesn't sound like the kind of comment a Galaxy Ranger would make.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Just pointing out the facts. Mr. Yang will definitely have a better sense of what's going on than I do.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Why do you say that, Miss Acheron?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: The beautiful dream is crumbling, but not because of a particular Aeon, a particular faction, or a particular visitor. Its collapse stems from a certain inevitability of human nature. The Family refuses to acknowledge this, and it has ultimately backfired and become a catalyst...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: As people immerse their souls in the Dreamscape, where consequences and pain cease to exist, and only ease and pleasure prevail, they draw closer and closer to necrosis. Regardless of the perceived bliss, death looms as the inevitable conclusion.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Also, this necrosis will diffuse and spread. One piece of the puzzle's mutation will eventually cause the entire building to shake, break... and crumble.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...In the end, the dreams that people built in the name of freedom became the cage that imprisoned them.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: I'm sure you've gained a lot from this trip, Miss Acheron. Are you willing to share your findings with me?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Of course... That's if I remember.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: She says this as her hand gently rests on the hilt of the sword.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: — And then quickly lets go, in the blink of an eye.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Don't mind me. It's just a habit. Owing to events in the past, I've become easily... forgetful. It's only when this sword is unsheathed that those hazy memories start to become clearer.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Take your time.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: That should do it. I vividly remember everything that occurred on Penacony. Ask away.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Regarding the Moment of Daybreak...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: The Moment of Daybreak — I've heard that's where the "Dawn Factory," which processes the foundation of the Dreamscape, is located.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Behind the Dreamscape's song and dance, stand many "imagination" factories. Workers create all kinds of whimsical works day in and day out in their dreams, then they return to reality and sleep on a narrow bed in a room — a far cry from luxury.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: They say it will suffice. Experiencing the bizarre and motley Dreamscape is the best reward.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: There, I encountered a young woman who had just come of age, the perfect time to indulge in beautiful dreams. Her greatest wish was to one day move to the Golden Hour and see the magnificent garments that she had woven with her own hands.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: For certain reasons, her wish was difficult to fulfill. But I managed to bring her a garment.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Regarding the Gilded Hour...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Gilded Hour... It's said to be Penacony's Currency Center.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Yes... It is a fortress-like financial city, the economic heart of the Dreamscape. The Pepeshi people of the Alfalfa Family are there to keep it running, sending blood that is made from money everywhere on Penacony.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Everyone there is exquisitely dressed and always in a hurry. The greatest wish of the local Pepeshi people is for their future generations to work in the Gilded Hour.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I've never met anyone who was willing to talk. I could only stand at the crossroads, watching crowds of people hurrying like the wind through the jungle of steel, only to deposit the Alfalfa credits that they'd earned into the bank's vault.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I don't know if they would open the vault door, but before I left, I witnessed a well-dressed Pepeshi person plummet from the sky while those around him continued on their way, unfazed.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: About the Blue Hour...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: I hear the Blue Hour is very romantic. Do you have any tales to share?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Perhaps Mr. Yang has heard — there is a large boat called the "Eventide" anchored along the Sea of Dreams, where soft music and dancing persist endlessly every night.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I ran into a wizened lady there. She was at the dock waiting for her long-departed lover to return, waiting for countless hours within time that stood still.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: In the humid sea breeze, she spoke of her own youth — like many who desired wealth and love, they came to Penacony to pursue their dreams. Alas, her lover's consciousness was lost in the dark depths of the Sea of Dreams.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Finally, she suggested we continue our conversation on a boat in the shallows. I agreed, and boarded the boat with her, but she never said anything, her eyes absent-mindedly gazing at the horizon for what seemed like forever.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Finally, we retreated to the beach.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: About the Moment of Dusk...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: The Dreamscape of chic, luxury and consumerism — the Moment of Dusk — my companions have been there too.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Then you all must have seen those who are attempting to realize their dreams, or have realized them, scattering money as if it were dust, and betting it on all or nothing. Everything has a price, and everything can be bought or sold — even dreams themselves.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I saw an Intellitron there who was preparing to auction himself. When someone wins a bid, under stipulated periods and rules, he would do the buyer's every bidding, becoming that person's very possession.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: That Intellitron had been auctioned off a dozen times, and I participated in his thirteenth. That was the grandest banquet I had ever attended, but never again did anyone cast another glance at him.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: This time around, there were no successful bids for him.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: That's everything.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: This is what I've seen and heard along the way...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Someone once said to me: Penacony wasn't like this a long time ago, nor should it be.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I've traveled through the reality and Dreamscape of the Planet of Festivities, watched the tides of night rise and fall, when time stopped for people. Where the spirits of the rich and impoverished... remain forever fixed on their own scales.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: This is why I think the collapse of the beautiful dream is inevitable.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: There might be a way to change everything.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Perhaps. But if this is indeed the world that people desire — if this is precisely why life chooses to slumber — should we still seek to change it?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...Miss Acheron, now it's my turn to share a story with you.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: There was a man from my homeland who, at a time when the world was grappling with deep, unhealable pain, made a choice.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: He wove together the dreams of everyone in the world, linking people's dreamscapes, and shouldered this burden himself. From this, he created a giant, a "Spiritual Adam."
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Since that moment, the giant stood between heaven and earth, becoming the pillar of the world's existence. As a price, those who found it hard to move forward, who could not advance... forever lost their "future."
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: They slumbered in a dream devoid of disaster and pain, living out their days peacefully in the man's created utopia. And it is because of the wishes of those people, who wished not to awaken, that this Spiritual Adam became unbreakable.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: And yet, you stand here right now, which also means... that man failed.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Because people must always move towards the future. Even if human weaknesses make them pause, when they truly cannot move forward... humanity will eventually seek a way to save itself.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: And that man... He was NEVER a failure. Like everyone in that world, he etched the possibilities of human nature into his heart.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: He was the sunchaser of legend, soaring towards the sky, and embracing his final victory with his fall.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: He ascended to heights uncharted, only to come face to face with the sun — a place not visited by anyone before. His wings would melt because of it, only for him to fall into the sea, and after that...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...countless others would surpass him, soaring to even greater heights.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: ...A fitting metaphor for the Nameless' Trailblazing spirit.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Thank you, Mr. Yang. I know what you wish to confirm. The universe has innumerable similar, yet different worlds. In these worlds, there are innumerable people who look alike, yet don't.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I, too have embarked on journeys, encountering "old friends" with familiar faces on different worlds, witnessing their destinies follow paths similar to mine. So, I will tell you...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Even if not completely similar, this story you just told... It overlaps with my past. And within that abyssal dream...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: ...I ended that man's life, alone.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I am not who you think I am, nor will my home be as fortunate as your world.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...I am sorry.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: It's fine. I don't mind, so long as I can alleviate your suspicions.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...There's something I still wish to know, Miss Acheron. Under that representation of The Hunt, exactly what sort of power is it that has motivated your solitary journey thus far?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: ...Mr. Yang, before answering that question, I wish to continue the previous topic.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I like your analogy very much. Indeed, birds are born to fly, but in a distant past, their ancestors could only gaze at the sky in envy.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: They saw that faraway ray of light from above the heavens, piercing through the clouds and blanketing the earth. And so, time and time again, generation after generation, the birds spread their wings and took to the sky, attempting to touch its ceiling — all because the sun was there.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Then, what if the last bird finally soars into the sky, only to realize that the end of the light is not the sun, but darkness...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Then why exactly... do we even walk towards the light?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Step DescriptionOnce again, the focus shifts. Sometimes, you feel as though you're living in a movie — nothing else can explain the constant switch of the point-of-view. The Reverie
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Long time no see! Having fun on Penacony, Acheron?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: 
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Though I don't know exactly what you are or what you're up to...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: My bullets will find you — until then, you best find a casket store on Penacony, and ask the owner to reserve a good quality casket for you, imposter!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: 
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: Who are you?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Huh? Did I make a mistake? Who the fudge are you?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: I'm the Garden of Recollection's Memokeeper.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Heh! Not bad. This is the kind of tough challenge I like. Are you that imposter's bodyguard? Never mind. It's fine. I'll leave a round for you, so get that forehead clean and wait for me!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: I don't know what you're talking about — but you know Acheron, the Galaxy Ranger, yes? I have something to ask you.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Haha, are you asking me to write your will? Sure, go ahead.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: Not quite. I only want to ask, how exactly did she become a Galaxy Ranger?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: ...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: She's clearly not a Pathstrider of The Hunt. But you are, aren't you? Tell me, what's Acheron's deal?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Hahahaha, sure! Never thought I'd come across an ally. Fudge, what a stroke of luck!
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: I'll be on Penacony soon. Memokeeper, go buy a bottle of Asdana's White Oak and warm it up, and I'll raise a glass to you.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: That lady's past? Nobody knows. But if all you want is a simple answer, sure, you best get a chair and take a seat. That woman named Acheron...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Media]: Trailblaze Mission When the Sacred Ginmill Closes.mp4
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: —is an Emanator who should not exist.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Switching to Aventurine's POV...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Aventurine seems to have lost everything, but he still decides to hand out jewels and money on the street to make the most of what he has left. What is he trying to achieve...?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: At this moment, on the other side...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Even after that chilling tragedy, this dream is still running effortlessly.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Other than The Family of the Harmony, it's hard to imagine any other power in the universe that could sustain a building of such magnitude.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: The Family itself is a huge, perfect building. Like... A living idol.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Each member of The Family sees themselves as a piece of the divine puzzle, revolving around a singular core and a shared ideal. Under THEIR command, they loyally fulfill their roles, offering themselves while also receiving sustenance in return.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Interesting analogy. Perhaps that's why Penacony's "beautiful dream" has persisted for so long.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: But the human body has its limits, and so does the divine's.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: That doesn't sound like the kind of comment a Galaxy Ranger would make.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Just pointing out the facts. Mr. Yang will definitely have a better sense of what's going on than I do.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Why do you say that, Miss Acheron?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: The beautiful dream is crumbling, but not because of a particular Aeon, a particular faction, or a particular visitor. Its collapse stems from a certain inevitability of human nature. The Family refuses to acknowledge this, and it has ultimately backfired and become a catalyst...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: As people immerse their souls in the Dreamscape, where consequences and pain cease to exist, and only ease and pleasure prevail, they draw closer and closer to necrosis. Regardless of the perceived bliss, death looms as the inevitable conclusion.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Also, this necrosis will diffuse and spread. One piece of the puzzle's mutation will eventually cause the entire building to shake, break... and crumble.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...In the end, the dreams that people built in the name of freedom became the cage that imprisoned them.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: I'm sure you've gained a lot from this trip, Miss Acheron. Are you willing to share your findings with me?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Of course... That's if I remember.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: She says this as her hand gently rests on the hilt of the sword.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: — And then quickly lets go, in the blink of an eye.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: ...?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Don't mind me. It's just a habit. Owing to events in the past, I've become easily... forgetful. It's only when this sword is unsheathed that those hazy memories start to become clearer.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Take your time.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: That should do it. I vividly remember everything that occurred on Penacony. Ask away.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Regarding the Moment of Daybreak...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: The Moment of Daybreak — I've heard that's where the "Dawn Factory," which processes the foundation of the Dreamscape, is located.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Behind the Dreamscape's song and dance, stand many "imagination" factories. Workers create all kinds of whimsical works day in and day out in their dreams, then they return to reality and sleep on a narrow bed in a room — a far cry from luxury.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: They say it will suffice. Experiencing the bizarre and motley Dreamscape is the best reward.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: There, I encountered a young woman who had just come of age, the perfect time to indulge in beautiful dreams. Her greatest wish was to one day move to the Golden Hour and see the magnificent garments that she had woven with her own hands.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: For certain reasons, her wish was difficult to fulfill. But I managed to bring her a garment.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Regarding the Gilded Hour...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: Gilded Hour... It's said to be Penacony's Currency Center.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Yes... It is a fortress-like financial city, the economic heart of the Dreamscape. The Pepeshi people of the Alfalfa Family are there to keep it running, sending blood that is made from money everywhere on Penacony.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Everyone there is exquisitely dressed and always in a hurry. The greatest wish of the local Pepeshi people is for their future generations to work in the Gilded Hour.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I've never met anyone who was willing to talk. I could only stand at the crossroads, watching crowds of people hurrying like the wind through the jungle of steel, only to deposit the Alfalfa credits that they'd earned into the bank's vault.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I don't know if they would open the vault door, but before I left, I witnessed a well-dressed Pepeshi person plummet from the sky while those around him continued on their way, unfazed.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: About the Blue Hour...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Welt]: I hear the Blue Hour is very romantic. Do you have any tales to share?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Perhaps Mr. Yang has heard — there is a large boat called the "Eventide" anchored along the Sea of Dreams, where soft music and dancing persist endlessly every night.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: I ran into a wizened lady there. She was at the dock waiting for her long-departed lover to return, waiting for countless hours within time that stood still.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: In the humid sea breeze, she spoke of her own youth — like many who desired wealth and love, they came to Penacony to pursue their dreams. Alas, her lover's consciousness was lost in the dark depths of the Sea of Dreams.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Finally, she suggested we continue our conversation on a boat in the shallows. I agreed, and boarded the boat with her, but she never said anything, her eyes absent-mindedly gazing at the horizon for what seemed like forever.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Acheron]: Finally, we retreated to the beach.
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: About the Moment of Dusk...

[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Long time no see! Having fun on Penacony, Acheron?
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Black Swan]: 
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][???]: Though I don't know exactly what you are or what you're up to...

[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Switching to Aventurine's POV...
[When the Sacred Ginmill Closes][Narration]: Aventurine seems to have lost everything, but he still decides to hand out jewels and money on the street to make the most of what he has left. What is he trying to achieve...?

[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: You look pale. Or, is that also part of your act?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Didn't think you'd have the nerve to show yourself.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I thought this was exactly what you wanted. After all, I faithfully fulfilled my duties as you instructed.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Just tell me if you can't hold on any longer.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: So, the "genius" of the Council of Mundanites wants to be my undertaker now? My... what an honor.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Yeah, and I'm pretty sure the people at the Strategic Investment Department would love to be notified of your death in due time, but let's not forget you won't be seeing them, because I'm the manager of this task.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Great, then tell your people that Aventurine is ready to go in seventeen system hours.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: You've got a lot of nerve — how exactly do you plan on completing your task while your hands are tied by the Harmony?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: My conversation with Sunday convinced me that there's a traitor in The Family, and that they hold the secrets of Penacony... So, I took the opportunity to set everything in motion.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: I even managed to recover the gift money. Things haven't gone this smoothly since I walked through the doors of The Reverie... Now, I'm only one step away from victory. Let's just wait and see.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Sounds like a very elaborate way of saying that you failed.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: That's all I can say. Have you forgotten, Doctor? You betrayed me.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Go, do what you must. I look forward to the sight of the IPC fleet surrounding Penacony. You've achieved what you desired, haven't you?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: That's true, but what's your plan? Did you conceal an Orbital Support beacon in that gift money bag?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Well, who knows? Maybe that's why I'm handing out cash even when I'm about to bite the dust.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...You are indeed a gambler — an insane one at that.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Well, maybe I am. Who knows?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Fine. Here, take this. Open it when you're on your last legs. You'll thank me.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: What's this...? Medical advice?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: You catch on pretty fast, Doctor.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Asking me to solve a case without giving a single clue... How typical of you, you wing-headed scoundrel.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: But the way you're all on edge about that stowaway, it's just as I guessed it would be. As for now... let the rain of wealth from the IPC fall evenly on everyone.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: The world has truly lost its way...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Here, I got these gems for you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: You... Wait, I get it now! This is some sort of prank show, right? You must have some cameras set up around here to film yourself doing good deeds, right?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: You youngsters are always looking for a quick way to get an audience, but you know what? A truly great show never comes easy.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: A great show will start soon, old man. But before that, I need to ask you something. Do you know where I can find "Death" in this dream?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: Ah, I see! Another fearless youngster looking for death, huh? Well, let me give you a piece of advice. Don't think you're the first one who's ever thought of that idea.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: Death? Not even remotely innovative. I bought it from Dr. Edward. He claimed it was some exclusive fancy-schmancy stuff... But what a disappointment.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: The effects were awful. First, some monster covered in eyes stabs you in the gut, and then all you see are blurry glimpses of buildings and lights. The sky was spinning so fast it almost made me puke...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Is that all?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: Yeah, what else can you expect? Don't put too much stock in the Penacony movie industry... They even call this junk "groundbreaking art," can you believe it?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...What a joke. Well, I'll leave you be, then. I hope you have a wonderful day!
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Chabro]: The world has truly lost its way...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: Would you be willing to support my performance, and keep the Song of Beauty alive in the cosmos?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Here, I got these gems for you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: Wow, how fabulous! But why would you give such a wonderful gift to a random stranger like me?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Well, you see... I can't bear to see anyone in this sweet dream suffering from poverty.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: That's... incredibly kind of you. Thank you so much, sir. If you ever get the chance, please feel free to come by and indulge in my singing.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Sure thing. By the way, do you happen to know anything interesting about "Death"?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: "Death"? That's... a pretty scary topic, and it doesn't really match the mood of this sweet dream.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: You see, I'm a tabloid reporter collecting ghost stories in Penacony. As you know, the more chilling the stories... the more attention they get. Maybe you could help me out?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: Well, if you're up for some gossip... It's not about death, but there have been some rumors about a guest at the reality Hotel who fell into a deep sleep and didn't wake up.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: It was like they were in some sort of coma. Nobody knows what caused it, but luckily, the customer eventually regained consciousness... Well, all customers are under the protection of The Family, after all.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Thank you. This will make for a very juicy headline. May Xipe protect us.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Larose]: Would you be willing to support my performance, and keep the Song of Beauty alive in the cosmos?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: A sip of liquor, a blissful reprieve... To drown a thousand sorrows, let worries leave... Hah, I know I have what it takes to become a poet...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Here, I got these gems for you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: Oh? You... you are giving... these gems to me? Didn't expect to meet such a generous soul in this place...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: Or are you just pitying me? Well, it doesn't really matter... As long as I have... SoulGlad... that's enough. This is just a dream after all... Haha...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: You really shouldn't drink so much SoulGlad, my friend. It's not good for your health.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: Oh! Hah, maybe I really should quit... but not before meeting... the Devil of SoulGlad...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: The Devil of SoulGlad... Care to elaborate?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: Haha... yeah... It's a... seahorse... with a long neck!
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: They say... it loves to appear to drunk people... especially the ones... who are passed out on the side of the road! Hah! How funny...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...Yeah, very funny indeed. Thank you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Bocchi]: A sip of liquor, a blissful reprieve... To drown a thousand sorrows, let worries leave... Hah, I know I have what it takes to become a poet...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Woolsey]: Take care, my friend. If you ever find yourself in danger, remember that the Hounds are always ready to help.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Here, I got these gems for you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Woolsey]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: The expression on this hunk of a man was complex, as if he were looking at a mud-soaked sparrow, unable to fly and nearing its end.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Woolsey]: You don't look good, my friend... If you need assistance, I can contact the hotel and have them wake you up forcefully.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: That won't be necessary. I have some business to attend to... but thank you all the same.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Woolsey]: Alright then. If you ever need help, don't hesitate to reach out to us Hounds.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Well, actually, I do need a favor... As the most outstanding Hound in Penacony, have you come across any stowaways recently?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Woolsey]: Stowaways? How could there be stowaways in Penacony? We've never had anything like that before.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: All right... Good luck with your work, then.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Woolsey]: Take care, my friend. If you ever find yourself in danger, remember that the Hounds are always ready to help.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: You want to talk to me? Sure, but nothing too sensitive, okay?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Here, I got these gems for you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: Wealthy people have fancy ways to enjoy this dream, but to be honest, I've never seen anyone who gives out money to others like you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: So, are you trying to be the prince from the tale, handing out his gold-leaf garment and melting his lead heart in the fire?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Haha, I'm flattered. I'm no prince, and I just thought these gems would help you speak. So, as an investigative reporter, maybe you have heard of something about "Death"?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: Another curious soul, I see. Well, that was actually the topic I was most into when I entered the industry, but my boss shut it down.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: How did your boss talk you out of it?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: Well... She simply said, "Covering baseless urban legends like that would make us look like some third-rate tabloid."
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: I thought about it, and she had a point... Reporting on stuff like blowing out birthday candles and getting spooked by nightmare ghosts... isn't exactly professional material.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Heh, I guess she's got a point... Thank you for sharing.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Uma]: You want to talk to me? Sure, but nothing too sensitive, okay?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: Hmm... Were you wanting to talk to me? Sorry, I thought you were checking out something behind me.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Here, I got these gems for you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: Is this... a gift for me? Are you sure this isn't some kind of mistake?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Yes, it's for you... Just take it.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: Is this for real? Someone is actually giving me a gift? Not for my parents, but for me... Thank you, thank you so much!
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Oh, it's not much. I just want to ask you something.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: ...Ugh, I knew it. What's on your mind? Are you trying to ask about my father, or my mother?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Um... neither. I just wanted to know if you've ever heard about "Death" in the Dreamscape?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: Oh, you sound just like my father... Always warning me about danger even in dreams.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: He's an Intellitron, so his dream entry methods are different from us organics. Can't count on him to protect me if something does go haywire. Funny, right now I'm still under his protection... Heh, how ironic...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...Hey, stay positive. Gold will always shine one day, right?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Barrle]: Hmm... Were you wanting to talk to me? Sorry, I thought you were checking out something behind me.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: 
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][???]: Remember what I said? You Sigonians are better off hiding in the sewers...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][???]: Look at you, snooping around and sticking your nose everywhere...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Is the smell of "Death" so enticing, my fine fellow?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Heh... it's you, Masked Fool. I should have guessed it. You're the "imposter" who appeared on TV after Robin's death, right?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: I heard you got caught by The Family? I gave you a clear clue... "Befriend a mute." Simple and straightforward, you know...?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: And what did you do? You messed it up and ended up as their prisoner. I told you to make friends with a mute, not become one yourself. You really let me down.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...What do you mean?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: You know better than I do. Who watched the little songbird that couldn't sing perish right before their eyes? You did, Blondie.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: No, I mean... what did you mean by "becoming one myself"?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Well, it means you'll soon end up like her, unable to speak ever again.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: But it's a good thing, if you ask me, because...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Because I'm getting closer to the truth, right?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: ...Oh?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Why else do you think I'm handing out cheap trinkets all over the streets, Fool?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: All part of the act. Fool's bait. The more pathetic I seem, the more likely you'll come sniffing around. So. Now that I've drawn you out, will you reward me with an answer for my efforts?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Why should I help you?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Don't you want to see Penacony descend into chaos? Well, I can make it happen. I just need an answer to one question: Back then, when you asked me to find a "mute"...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...Did you really mean Robin?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: ...And what if I say "no"?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Then I'll thank you. The word "no" has never sounded so pleasing.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Well done. I admit I underestimated you, but what difference would it make?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Let me tell you something. There were two mutes, but one is dead now,[Note 1] and the other... Though "she" is still in Penacony, I'm afraid you'll never find "her" again.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Now I'm completely sure that I was on the right track from the beginning and never strayed, Fool.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Right now, there are only two things missing from my grasp: The meaning behind the truth and the means to expose it.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: How impressive! That's quite a fancy way of saying "I haven't learned anything so far."
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Not exactly. I've gathered enough clues to prove its existence, and that's enough for me. As for the answers to my questions, I'll find them within seventeen... no, sixteen system hours.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Oh, really? "Only" sixteen system hours? Well, let me lend you a hand.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Here you go. This is my precious "Mutually Assured Destruction" button, and I have one just like it. When either of us presses it, the other and the whole of Penacony will go up in smoke.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: If you're really so desperate for the IPC to take over Penacony... blowing up the chessboard isn't a bad idea. Start from scratch! That's where the IPC excels, right?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Just press the button when you're at your wit's end. And of course, feel free to reach out to me for my "hospice care" too!
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: A deadly button, huh?... I guess The Family didn't take your threats seriously at all? Otherwise, how on earth did you manage to bring it in here?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: I have my own ways. That's all you need to know.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer. Who knows if your little gadget will actually work? By the way, I have no plans to search for the other mute friend you speak of, but it's good to hear that he's still here in Penacony.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: I'll handle the rest myself. I'll orchestrate a grand finale for the downfall of The Family. And at the climax, the walls will crumble, people will wake up, and those who couldn't speak will find their voices again...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: When that time comes, go ahead and press the button, and light up the sky with a magnificent fireworks display for me. Catch you later, Fool.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: You're still talking big... But sure, if that happens, I'll stay true to my word.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Sparkle]: Just don't let me down now, okay?

[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: So, No. 35, you're back. Like your new lucky charm?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...Can a "commodity code" really be considered a lucky charm?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Silence. I didn't give you permission to speak, you Sigonian hound.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: The guys in black didn't say much, so I've no idea what you did to save your skin in that massacre back in the day.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: But I figured you must have had good luck, so I bought you. From now on, you and your good luck are MY assets. Are we clear?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Your first task is simple. In addition to you, I've purchased thirty... well, thirty-four other slaves.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Go and play a "game" with them. If you come out alive after two days, it proves that you're the real deal.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...You're insane.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Heh, testing out if you're a good product.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Aren't you worried that the money you spent on me will go to waste?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: I've got stacks on stacks, blondie. The slave market is never short of self-righteous brats like you.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: But you look good, and that's why many customers are betting their fortunes on a scrawny brat like you. So, go along now, and don't let your master down.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...How much did you spend?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: What?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: My price. How much did you pay for me?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Huh, you really want to know? Well, it was sixty Tanba. No more, no less.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: ...I'll take my chances.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Aventurine]: Thirty Tanba... If I come back alive, you'll give me thirty Tanba. Deal?
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Hahaha, are you trying to strike a bet with me? Well, you've got some guts!
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: Sorry, but that won't do. Don't forget your place, slave. You're not qualified to be at the table.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: You're just a chip, a life thrown away in someone else's hands. Either you come back with more chips for your master, or... you never come back.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Indifferent Male]: It's all or nothing. Don't embarrass me, my lucky hound.
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: ...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Heaven is a Place on Earth][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][???]: What brings you here, Gallagher?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Some friends from the old days. Do you have a moment to spare, Siobhan?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: I have the whole day to spare. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dreamjolt Hostelry!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: This bar offers a wide variety of drinks, but we draw the line at SoulGlad. Why settle for ordinary when you can experience extraordinary? We're dedicated to serving up nothing but pure joy and laughter.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: What would you like to drink? I'll whip it up for you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Look, ! A lady as cool as Serval!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: She's cool, indeed.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I think she is Serval.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Who's Serval? Will you introduce me to her?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Oops, she's heard us...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Just spare them, my esteemed bartender. I'll take over the bar today.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: I'm getting up there in age, and I need some practice before I forget the skills that used to put food on my table. Where did you stash the ingredients?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: They're all under the counter. Since our guests have traveled from afar, shouldn't you whip up some special drinks?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: That's exactly what I had in mind. Hey, my friends, do me a favor. Go around the bar and bring me any ingredients you fancy.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The discussion might take quite some time, so I'll prepare some customized, non-alcoholic drinks for you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: In the bar? But aren't all the ingredients right there on the counter?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Why, we're in a dream, my lovely lady. You can help yourself to anything if you wish for it — comfort, hunger, confusion, or even boredom... It's all within reach, right at your fingertips.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Did you hear that! She just called me "my lovely lady"...!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Even in reality, mixing drinks is more than just throwing ingredients together. A bartender needs to capture the bar's atmosphere, master technique, and spin a tale of mystery and anticipation...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Only then can a perfect drink, crafted with the customer's life story, be created.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: In other words, what you get from your drink is down to luck. So don't overthink it. Indecisiveness has no place when it comes to enjoyment.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: And let me tell you, don't underestimate the bartenders of Penacony, especially not Gallagher. This guy is pure magic... He can satisfy even the pickiest of customers.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Don't go easy on this old man. Give him a real challenge.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: That being said, mixing a drink is way simpler than you'd imagine. Just pick your favorite ingredients, toss them in a glass, mix it up, and it's done.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: So go ahead, explore the bar and bring me any ingredients you prefer.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I'll come back later.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Go ahead, my friend. I'm sure you'll find splendid ingredients.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Can this be used for mixing drinks? Oh, and there's a note underneath... "Exchange with your precious things."
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: What should we exchange for it?... And who should we give our stuff to?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Give "Praise of High Morals"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: You put "Praise of High Morals" into the empty cup in a metaphysical manner...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: ...Whoa, the words on the note are changing!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: "Happiness belongs to the noble." Does this mean we can take it? Ahaha, doing good deeds does pay off! Thank you!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Give 50,000 credits...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: You put 50,000 credits into the empty cup
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: ...Whoa, the words on the note are changing!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: "Stairs made of coins can lead to happiness." Does this mean we can take it? I'm not sure if it's a good deal... but thank you anyway!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Give a bag of trash...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: You put a bag of trash into the empty cup
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Hey, what are you doing! You can't just throw trash... No way! The words on the note are changing!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: "Happiness is the dream of the humble." Does this mean we can take it? Something feels weird about this...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: There doesn't seem to be anything that can be put in...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Check out this bottle. The liquid inside looks beautiful, and the label reads... Dream Syrup . I don't see an expiration date, but the production date is...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: ...Half an Amber Era ago?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. That's for sure...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Maybe it hasn't expired yet.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Ugh... the syrup has turned clumpy... I definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: But I thought we could drink anything in dreams?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: That's true, but this... really doesn't seem fresh...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Did you find the bottle of syrup I've been hoarding? Don't worry, it's all just a dream, and it won't upset your stomach. It's been aging for years, and should have a refined taste by now. Feel free to have some. It's perfect for entertaining lovely guests like you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Then... we'll keep it for now...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: It's SoulGlad! But I thought they didn't sell SoulGlad at the bar?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Let's give it a shake! Nice, it's still fizzy and has a long shelf life!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Maybe someone else brought it here.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: That's possible. You see SoulGlad everywhere these days, so it wouldn't be a surprise if someone brought a bottle here.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Maybe it's placed here for decoration.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Yeah, perhaps. SoulGlad is a classic in Penacony, and it'd be strange for a bar not to have it.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Don't! It's no good for our drink if all shaken up.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Uh-huh! I... Let's just leave it here for a while... and it'll be alright, right?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Why don't they sell SoulGlad in this bar? Did something happen?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: It's all about the bartender's pride. It wouldn't make sense for customers to come here and order drinks they can find anywhere else. That's the mindset I use when I brew my coffee.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Um... Haha, you're right, Himeko.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Hey, look at all these chips scattered everywhere...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: A few days ago, an actor from the Iris Family came — caused a ruckus with Siobhan... Those chips must have gotten scattered during all the chaos.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I can only imagine how intense that scene must have been.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Nah, it turned out to be a landslide victory.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: So, enemies drop gold coins even in a dream?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Haha, that's a clever metaphor.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: That being said, opening a bar in this place... filled with monsters... is quite a feat. Siobhan must have a lot of tricks up her sleeve, right?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: You'll have to ask her yourself to find out. But I have a feeling she won't budge unless you impress her with an incredible drink.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Haven't I made myself clear enough, Ms. Amiky? The Dreamjolt Hostelry only welcomes guests who want to enjoy a drink to their heart's content. I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in your proposal.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: But you have the talent! You'll attract a huge audience... You're destined for the Iris' stage, not for this run-down shack!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Come with me! We'll become the talk of Penacony, shining light into every corner of the Dreamscape! Please, Siobhan, I really need you...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: ...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: ...As you see, I'm entertaining my guests. Don't make me repeat myself.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Fine... If you don't come along, I'll just sit here and not go anywhere else. Give me a sparkling drink, sweet, with extra ice.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Just one moment.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: What's her deal...? We can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: , can you do that clockwork trick of yours again...?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Just what I've been waiting for.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: How come even you, Himeko...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Time is running out. We need to hurry.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Yeah, I'm counting on you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: You're one of Siobhan's guests, right? What can I do for you? If you're here to convince me to leave, please stop it. I'll never leave until she accepts my proposal...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: I just don't get why she won't leave this place... this run-down shack with no customers whatsoever.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Siobhan just said, "Anything can be imbibed"... Perhaps you can try various experiments to see what different emotions can brew with different drink ingredients.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Try reading her thoughts.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I've no idea either...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Ah, forget it. I'll just stay here and wait until she changes her mind.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: I've seen it... the moment when Siobhan and I share the stage.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: The crowd is going wild, applause crashing like waves. The aroma of irises fills the air, a beautiful melody playing, ribbons dancing around us. And the taste... is sweeter than honey.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: I've seen that scene countless times in my dreams, and every time, it mesmerizes me. That's why I have to bring her back to that world, no matter what it takes.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Want to raise a glass, my attentive listener? Let's consider it... a toast to my far-fetched dream.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Amiky poured Pika White Grape Soda into your tall glasses. The rims gently clinked, emitting a crisp, resonant sound.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: :
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: ...It's ridiculous, right? Our paths were never meant to cross, yet I'm still holding on to her...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: I'm too timid and shy, longing to shine but afraid of stepping into the spotlight. I need her guidance, because I'll never be able to do anything alone...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: You don't know Siobhan's past, and you have no clue how... radiant she used to be. Even among the talented Iris Family, her skill was unmatched.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: I know... she probably thinks I'm just trying to ride her fame to get ahead, but all I want is for her to reclaim her place...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: You feel an inexplicable mix of bitterness and sweetness that permeates the air. The next moment, that emotion turns into liquid filling your goblet.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: :
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Those darn Iris jerks! They're the ones who forced Siobhan into hiding here, running this pesky bar... It's all their dirty scheming!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Ah... I get it now. She's not leaving because she doesn't want to run into them again!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: I... I can help clear the way for her. I can do her a favor! I'll go back and write a letter to the Dreammaster, exposing the crimes committed by the Iris Family... Siobhan will definitely appreciate it!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: :
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Well... talking to you has got me feeling a bit down. My thoughts are swirling, making my mind clear and bringing tears to my eyes...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Maybe... I should find a place to reflect on what Siobhan truly means to me...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Amiky]: Here's the payment for the drinks. Please pass it on to her. I'm leaving now.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: ...Amiky has left?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: *sigh* That's good for her... Radiant dreams may be enticing, but they're nothing more than dreams. Her drink is on the house. Please keep the money.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: When you're ready, go to Gallagher. I can tell he's itching to show off his skills.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: That being said, mixing a drink is way simpler than you'd imagine. Just pick your favorite ingredients, toss them in a glass, mix it up, and it's done.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: So go ahead, explore the bar and bring me any ingredients you prefer.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I've gathered all the ingredients I need.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Nice work. Let me take a look...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I'll come back later.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Go ahead, my friend. I'm sure you'll find splendid ingredients.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...You've found some interesting ingredients there. Now, take your pick.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Each drink has its own unique flavor, and the base ingredient sets the tone for the initial taste and the lingering aftertaste. So, which one would you like to use as the base?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Heh, you won't find a sweeter drink anywhere in Penacony, and that's what today's dream seekers crave.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Sweeter than Sousa Juice and more bitter than Dream Syrup. "Dream in a Bottle" — that's a metaphor for Penacony itself.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The original formula is said to be Hanunue's favorite drink. It's sour and bitter, and the bubbles burst in your throat like swallowing rusty chains, evoking thoughts of dungeons and prisons.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Now that you've chosen the base, it's time to pick the adjunct — the ingredient that'll create a marvelous chemical reaction with the base. It should give an unforgettable taste without overpowering the main tone. So, what's your choice for the adjunct?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Bright Future... a taste that's been a long time coming.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: I'll never forget the flavor that danced on my tongue as Mikhail whisked me through the Dreamscape wilderness. Those were haunting times... too beautiful to be real.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: This is the most pungent adjunct we have... and my personal favorite.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Before Mikhail left, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes had deepened, like knife cuts. He mumbled, his breath too weak to climb up his throat, caught up in his chest. But I could smell it... the lingering scent of Penacony itself on that night.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The taste is... not very intense, yet evocative.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: After those despicables sent Mikhail away, I found myself lost in the wilderness of my dreams. They say that even the dirt here oozes with sweetness... Heh, all I tasted was stoic bitterness.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Mikhail...?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Almost there. Let's pick a decoration. Which style do you prefer? Anything you need, I've got it.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Straws with concentric circles.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Concentric circles... May you always remember where you started.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Hanu's sign.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: A symbol of bravery and dauntlessness. May you break free from your shackles just like he did.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Coin-shaped lemon slices.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The IPC's favorite... Ambitious, aren't you?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Well, it's done...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, dream seeker, with this glass of El Dorado...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To golden dreams.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, sober one, with this glass of "a Dream Within a Dream"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To our forebearers who dug their own graves.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, dreamer, with this glass of "The Premature Burial"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To bringing time to a standstill.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, lost sheep, with this glass of "The Big Sleep"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To the ghosts of the past.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, seeker of truth, with this glass of "Farewell, My Lovely"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To unfinished business.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, watcher, with this glass of "The Long Goodbye"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To a bitter childhood.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, the Nameless, with this glass of "A Ticket to the Boneyard"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To the dead and the dying.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, innovator, with this glass of "Time to Murder and Create"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To great vengeance.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here's to you, Trailblazer, with this glass of "Even the Wicked"...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...To the sad truth.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Siobhan]: Well done, Gallagher. You're not over the hill yet.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: So, are you satisfied?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: The flavors... they're way more sophisticated than SoulGlad.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: The richness and layers of these flavors are a masterpiece, especially with the adjuncts. I can taste the spicy and sour notes with a hint of sweetness...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: I'm not entirely sure what it all means. Maybe Mr. Gallagher can shed some light on it?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Well, if you're expecting a profound answer, I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The imagery it implies is pretty straightforward... It's just a glimpse of what this dream truly tastes like. Nothing more.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Does this "true taste" have anything to do with that Mikhail?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Mikhail...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: I heard this name in my dream...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Yeah, that name does sound familiar... When you got knocked out by that Masked Fool girl, , I think I heard someone calling that name. Do you remember?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Heh... I was right about you. You guys seem to know quite a bit, and now there's no reason to hide anything from you anymore.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Let's dig deeper into the case, and of course... I'll tell you a story about Mikhail.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Alright, let's start with what we know based on the clues The Family has. It seems that Firefly isn't a local or an invited guest. In other words... she's a stowaway.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: She managed to fool me at first — my age must be getting the best of me. But here, on the Planet of Festivities, stowaways are a common sight. You're bound to run into one sooner or later. After the incident, the Hounds wasted no time searching for that girl in both the Dreamscape and reality.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: But here's the thing... We only received bad news, and the trickiest kind at that.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: She simply vanished, leaving no trace in the Dreamscape or reality, as if she had never come to Penacony at all.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Huh? Does that mean...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: "Death" eradicated her...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: That's impossible. The problem now is not that she's dead, but that it's as if she had never existed in the first place.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Maybe things will turn out different than what we think?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Different...? Are you suggesting that girl wasn't actually killed? Come on, aren't you a witness in this case?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Is she a ghost!?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Haha, a clever metaphor... Um, you were making a metaphor, right?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Let me be frank... This case, actually... is unlike anything the Bloodhound Family has dealt with before.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: "Dealt with before"? So... "Death" does happen in Penacony, if I understand correctly?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: You've witnessed it, so there's no need to hide. Even the shiniest city has its dark side. We're all adults here, surely I don't need to explain too much to you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Confronting The Family based on that alone would be naive. Death may occur in sweet dreams — so what? Such events are highly unlikely and only affect a tiny number of people.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: If you really want to delve deeper into this case, you need to understand the true "problem" with The Family.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: I guess it's time to tell the story of that "Mikhail."
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: You're very perceptive. The Astral Express has received that music box, too, right? Do you know the secrets it holds?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: There's a message. "...Witness the impossible in the realm of dreams, find the Legacy of the Watchmaker, Father of Penacony, and thus the answer to the question: Why does life slumber?"
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: That's the exact wording.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Hey, why are you laughing... Wait, did you write it? It's quite poetic.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: No... but I'm the officer in charge of this case, and how could I not know?... I'm sure you must have noticed that this message didn't come from The Family. You might even have guessed that the relationship between The Family and the Watchmaker isn't as close as it seems?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: That's just our speculation. Actually, it's hard to believe that the Father of Penacony and its actual managers are at odds.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Now I can assure you that your speculation is absolutely correct.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The Family has considered the Watchmaker as an enemy for a long time, but the Hounds haven't been able to track him down, as he seems to be living only in the characters and stories he created.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Let me ask you a question: Have you ever wondered why The Family allowed the Watchmaker to send out such a ridiculous message to the outside world, inviting you here and causing chaos?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: So, you want to seize this opportunity to expose the Watchmaker?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Well, now you understand why the Oak Family authorized the Nameless to assist in the investigation but kept you in the dark, right?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...Because the Watchmaker is not the legend of the Land of the Dreams at all. He's the most shameful stain in the history of Penacony, and he's the root cause of all the anomalies in the Dreamscape.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: But what does this have to do with Mikhail?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: You don't get it? Well, I mean...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...Mikhail, the betrayer of The Family... He's the Watchmaker.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Some time later...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Here we are, Clock Studios Theme Park, the most popular entertainment center in Penacony.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Wait, aren't we supposed to be discussing "The Watchmaker"? I would have expected you to take us to maybe a library or an archive room of sorts, but an amusement park...?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The culture of a city reflects its history in the most authentic way. To you, it's a fun place, but to me, it's a prison for the planet's past.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: You know that Penacony used to be the IPC's prison planet, right? All the prisoners were brought here, helping the Garden of Recollection salvage the leaking memoria from the Macro Void...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The prolonged exposure to high concentrations of memoria caused a unique phenomenon. The dreams of countless prisoners intersected and overlapped, and people started meeting each other in their dreams, living lives that were almost identical to reality.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: But everything has a price, and sweet dreams are no exception. In the end, the dream world was unable to alleviate the suffering of prisoners in reality. One of the prisoners broke free from the IPC's shackles and fought for freedom...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...He is Hanu, the great leader of Dreamville, the great peacemaker, and the faithful companion of the underdogs.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: So, the character "Hanu" is based on a real-life person?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: So that Clockie cartoon is actually a documentary...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: History is always written by the winners. However, it's undeniable that Clockie is an animation that draws from Penacony's actual history.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: These characters not only exist in Dreamville but also in the distant past. Once you realize this... you'll understand why we're here.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: There are so many members of the Bloodhound Family around here...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: They just received a lockdown order, supposedly from Sunday himself. Who knows what it's for.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Heh... so many of them... I've never seen anything like this, even when they're tracking down suspects.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Can you convince them to let us in?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: We don't need to go in — we don't want to draw any unwanted attention inside. We can just talk here.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: It's pretty impressive even from out here.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Well, it's a masterpiece from The Family after all. Besides the followers of the Preservation, The Family members are the best at creating mind-blowing marvels.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Let's find a quiet spot and continue our conversation.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The view here is great, right? We can see everything from here...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...Including Clockie.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: If all the characters in the animation are based on characters in reality, then Clockie's counterpart is definitely the Watchmaker.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: In the animation, he's Hanu's partner and one of the founders of Dreamville. Does that mean the Watchmaker was personally involved in that war and sided with Asdana?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: It was a monumental war for freedom. Hanunue fought alongside a motley crew of Masked Fools, Nameless, History Fictionologists, Mourning Actors, Omen Vanguards... even visitors from beyond the sky. In the end, they emerged victorious.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Among them was the person who would eventually be known as the Watchmaker.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: But if you do the math... doesn't that mean the Watchmaker was around for several centuries?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: I'm not sure, but Mikhail was already the Watchmaker when I met him, so maybe he inherited the title.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: ...How old are you now, Mr. Officer?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...I'm thirteen.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: No way! Not even close!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Hanunue freed the frontier prison, but peace still eluded him. With limited resources, threats from the outside world, and internal conflicts between major prison districts, the future of Asdana was uncertain.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: It wasn't until the Watchmaker approached The Family with the idea of turning the prison into the Planet of Festivities... that Penacony finally gained its name and glory.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Thus he became known as the Father of Penacony.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: But didn't you say the Watchmaker betrayed The Family? And you said you were his companion, so that means you...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: No, I'm not his "companion," but rather one of his many "children."
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: But I am indeed a traitor. Not to The Family, but to... Mikhail.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: ...What did you do?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: I did nothing... and that's the worst betrayal of all.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Just like you, I had close companions. We dedicated ourselves to Penacony, but the Oak Family... they set us up.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Mikhail was too old to protect his children anymore, so we left The Family to find our own path. We were branded traitors of the Harmony, even though the true traitors were someone else.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: While they continue to praise the Watchmaker's name to the world, behind closed doors they condemn him on a pillar of shame.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Nevertheless, we wanted to clear his name. We intended to find the real traitor, the one responsible for all this, and restore Harmony to Penacony...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...But we failed. Too much time had passed, and the Land of the Dreams had become deeply corrupted. After countless fruitless pursuits, I gave up... like a lost dog.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: The Family accepted me and made me an officer, supposedly as a form of forgiveness, but it was actually a punishment. Since then, I've been completely cut off from my partners... and my past. As for Mikhail...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...I heard he died in obscurity, in a place where no one could find him. That's when I realized that the Penacony I once knew would never return.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: We're truly sorry for what happened... but this is not the end of the story, right?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Hmm... Apparently, someone has inherited the title of the Watchmaker and has been secretly working against The Family all this time.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Who could that person be?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Is the Watchmaker an organization?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Well, that's one way to look at it. However, only one member has truly inherited the Watchmaker's title.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: Unfortunately, after all these years, I have no idea who that person is, or if they're even real... or just Mikhail's lost soul haunting the dreams.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: So, do you understand why I'm spilling all this info...? Because I believe the girl's death must be connected to the Watchmaker's Legacy, and at the end of all these mysteries...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...We will find the answers we are seeking.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: If it really is Mikhail's ghost, I want to meet him, if only for the last time. Those who despise me could form a line from here all the way to the entrance of the hotel, but those willing to look me in the eye and hear me out... Let's just say, there won't be many.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: I've told you all I know as a sign of gratitude. Thank you for listening to this old dog — bark and all.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: ...Hmm? Something just happened at the theme park... Now, if you'll excuse me. Good luck to all of you.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Gallagher]: How ironic. What's so different between the stowaways rejected by Penacony today and the dream seekers once hailed as pioneers several Amber Eras ago?
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: Gallagher... does have a troubled past, it seems.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: While Firefly's whereabouts remain a mystery, his stories shed light on our suspicions about the true identity of the Watchmaker, his connection to The Family, and the power struggles hidden behind sweet dreams and death.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: And that... The Family isn't all "united as one".
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Exactly. Gallagher suggests that the real traitor is someone else... probably within the Oak Family.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: And that... "Death" is related to the Watchmaker.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: That lines up with what we've gathered so far. Firefly got involved in this mess because of the Legacy... And now we're sure that Aventurine's accusations against Acheron are baseless.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: And that... Clockie is based on the Watchmaker.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][March 7th]: ...You're really into Clockie, huh? He's just a fictional character, not a real person!
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Speaking of which, that Clockie who only reveals himself to  is quite intriguing... It's a shame we've never met him since then.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: That pretty much sums it up.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Himeko]: Now that we've confirmed a lot of our suspicions, let's take a moment to think about the clues we have. , send a message to Welt and see how things are going on his end.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: MessagesThe Astral Express FamilyAsk about Welt's situation.Mr. Yang, our investigation here has come to an endHow's progress going on your end?WeltNot too bad. The Galaxy Ranger and I agree that The Family might be hiding something extremely important.We're now headed to Dewlight Pavilion.March 7thAcheron, huh? Didn't Aventurine say she was dangerous...WeltI've confirmed that she's on our side.Don't worry. Please wait for a while. I'll keep you posted as soon as I find anything.
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Switching to Acheron's POV...
[Why Do the Heathen Rage?][Narration]: Acheron and Welt have reached an understanding, directly targeting The Family with their suspicion. What will they discover at Dewlight Pavilion?

[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: ...Are your companions worried about you?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: They're just checking up on me. Let's get in and get out — it seems they've made some progress.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: ...Looks like we're about to enter the depths of Dewlight Pavilion.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: It's been a smooth ride... almost too smooth for a heavily guarded mansion.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Let's see if there's anyone waiting to greet us.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Something feels off... A grand mansion like this and not a butler or servant in sight... Could it be due to the disruption caused by the emergency?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: ...This door is open — looks like we'll have to investigate ourselves. Let's proceed with caution.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Just one moment.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: Acheron draws her blade slightly. Within a moment, her breath became imperceptible.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: "White"... I've made myself less noticeable. The Crew can explain their presence as authorized by The Family, but I can't come up with any excuses for being here.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: I see. What an interesting technique.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: The model in the sandpit... it's the Golden Hour, isn't it?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Maybe the heads of The Family use that model for discussing important matters.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: The footprints here are different from the rest... there are two sets of them. Looks like outsiders might have passed through here not long ago.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Can you identify the people who left these footprints?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Well... there's a unique pattern here — flamboyant even. And judging by the size, I'd say these were men's shoes.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: If I'm right... it could be the IPC ambassador, Aventurine.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Aventurine... What about the other set?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: It looks like they were walking side by side as opposed to one behind the other — so the second individual is likely equal in status to Aventurine.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: ...The IPC is eager to reclaim Penacony, so their presence here is not unexpected.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: While there aren't any people in this mansion... they've set up quite a few memetic guards to patrol this place.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Look, it dropped something.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: A... note? Looks like instructions from the butler for the other servants.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Seems like the mansion's entire workforce were assigned other tasks... before Robin's death.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: ...It must have been a big project to require that much manpower... the "Charmony Festival," perhaps.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: But no matter what their main priorities are, there should always be someone left at the mansion, right?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: So, you're saying... someone deliberately cleared the place out?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Yeah, but I don't know why.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: ...No one here either.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Since no one's around to entertain us, let's make ourselves at home. Stay close to me so that my "White" can cover you, too.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: A Letter from Robin
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: Dear Brother,How are you doing these days? I had intended to visit you at Dewlight Pavilion as soon as possible upon my return, but with the approaching Charmony Festival and your busy schedule, I refrained from troubling you. However, an urgent matter compels me to share something with you immediately.Since my return to Penacony, I have experienced a peculiar change in my voice. At first, I thought it was caused by exhaustion or illness, but after consulting with doctors, they assured me of my perfect health and dismissed my concerns. However, my voice worsened over time, and I even experienced periods of complete voice loss.In order to find answers, I conducted many private investigations . Eventually, I realized that the Harmony in Penacony is not pure. A discord lurking within has tainted my voice of Harmony, which I believe to be the root cause of my vocal issues.I immediately realized that such levels of interference can only occur if either a powerful external force is pulling the strings, or if a senior member of The Family is involved. Unfortunately, further investigation has led me to the latter conclusion.This is an extremely alarming discovery: A traitor has emerged within The Family in Penacony, and it is highly likely that this person is one of the four family heads. . With the Charmony Festival on the horizon, I fear this person intends to impede its progress, or even use the festival for some ulterior motive. At any rate, I suggest you monitor the other family heads while also prioritizing your own safety. You are the only true family member I have left.There is another matter that requires our attention. During my investigation, I learned about the Memory Zone Meme "Death," and my further inquiries led me to believe that the culprit who directed it to cause this series of incidents is likely the aforementioned traitor in The Family. I have collected more clues and am prepared to verify my hypothesis. Rest assured, you can just focus on the preparations for the Charmony Festival. Once I've thoroughly investigated "Death," I'll come and meet you immediately. It won't take too long.Given your heavy workload, please take care of yourself. Don't stay in the Dreamscape all the time. Spend some time in reality when you are free. I've brought some more specialties from other galaxies: Giantmoa pudding tarts from Morillons, wild strawberries from Akonyako , and almond meringue cream cracknels from Medicia. Don't forget to enjoy them!May Xipe be with us!Your sister,Robin
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: As soon as I and the rest of the Crew arrived in Penacony, Mr. Sunday and Robin showed up to greet us. I remember hearing something unusual in her voice... and now it seems I was right.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Robin believed it was because the Harmony had been tampered with somehow, but as far as I know, there aren't many entities capable of interfering with the power of Paths.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Meaning...
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: If there really is a traitor within The Family... that person must hold a high position or possess unimaginable strength.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: That would explain why Mr. Sunday has been having such difficulty in catching the traitor.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: List of Death's Victims
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: Ansorol, a male Halovian, was dragged into the sea by an unknown meme while sunbathing on the beach in the Moment of Oasis. Subsequent search and rescue operations proved unsuccessful.Note: This was the first case. Can't tell if anything is wrong. Insufficient investigation?Mouri, a male from Xianzhou, entered a Spheroid in Golden Hour and mysteriously disappeared while the Spheroid was bouncing in air. Later examinations showed no signs of forced entry or exit on the Spheroid.Note: It seems the culprit can ignore physical barriers. Conventional investigation methods feasible?Emaka, a female human, participated in a talent show in the Moment of Scorchsand but accidentally fell off the stage before the judges turned around and disappeared in the shadows below. The footage for that episode of the show has been deleted.Note: The culprit is swift and skilled at disguises. Caution is advised.Weber, a male Pepeshi, fell down when entering his office on payday in Gilded Hour, and was killed by an unknown meme that suddenly appeared. The memories of witnesses have been processed.Note: Preferring to attack wounded or vulnerable individuals? Uncertain. May be taking orders from someone else.Chemmet, a male Pepeshi, was taken away while flipping over a card at a casino in the Moment of Stars. The casino staff has dealt with the aftermath of the incident.Note: Flipping a card. Interesting.Dekem, a male human, jumped into the ocean of dream bubbles in Blue Hour in an attempt to impress his girlfriend but got entangled by an unknown meme under the sea and drowned. His girlfriend's memories have been processed, but the outcomes are not satisfactory. Further intervention from Motivators may be necessary.Note: Most cases are related to the ocean. Could this be a breakthrough?Additional Note: Scratch that. After checking, only two cases were related to the ocean.Caixia, a female Foxian, was engulfed by an unknown meme while playing Dreamy Slots in Golden Hour. The incident caused a huge commotion at the spot. The memories of most witnesses have been processed.Note: Could it be the Sweet Dreams Troupe? Does it have the ability to imitate and learn? Multiple culprits? There is likely a mastermind behind the scenes.Kambega, a male Bloodhound, was attacked by an unknown meme before his shift change in the Moment of Serenity, resulting in his death after a fight. Security measures have been enhanced in the prison area.Note: No notable details in this case. Need to ask the Bloodhound Family to strengthen defenses in the prison and other facilities.Janet, a female human, disappeared while visiting the film history gallery at the museum in the Moment of Sol. She was drawn towards a mysterious sound calling to her and walked into a screen, vanishing without a trace. The site has been cordoned off.Note: This is the only case where the culprit demonstrated speech ability. Further verification is required to determine if this is a false claim.Monk, a male Intellitron, was attacked while replacing his newly purchased high-grade vision sensor in the auction at the Moment of Dusk.Note: Vision sensor? Noteworthy.Annette, a female Pepeshi, vanished while touching up her makeup in the bathroom before the graduation ceremony at Paperfold Academy in the Moment of Sol. She was caught by a meme into a mirror and disappeared, witnessed by a teacher at the scene.Note: Mirror? Noteworthy. Current hypothesis is related to sight.Chloe, a female Intellitron, was attacked by a meme and disappeared when she blew out the candles during her birthday celebration with her friends in Blue Hour. All witnesses are currently receiving treatment from Motivators.Note: More attacks occurred in dark or dim environments. Is "sight" really a trigger?Carissa, a female Halovian, was harassed by a fervent fan backstage before her performance in the Moment of Scorchsand and was subsequently abducted by a meme during her escape. The Bloodhound Family has apprehended the fan.Note: Abducted? Keep a lookout for this fervent fan.Dorian, a male human, took a nap before the end of his shift in the Moment of Daybreak without telling his managers and was abducted by an unknown meme hiding under a chair. Emergency intervention was provided, and production at the factory has resumed as usual.Note: Taking a nap? Plus, consider discussing with the Alfalfa Family about increased vacation time and additional breaks for workers.Marlowe, a male human, disappeared after being involved in a car accident in Golden Hour. Witnesses reported the presence of an eerie meme who fled underground at the scene of the accident.Note: This is a genuine case of "Death." The meme must be connected to concepts such as death and murder....*This list comprises over a hundred cases related to the Memory Zone Meme "Death." However, the author of the list seems to still struggle with figuring out the pattern.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: The information about Robin, Firefly... and the other victims... I don't see any commonalities among them.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Looks like the rumors were right — "Death" does seem to be targeting random victims. And based on Sunday's notes... he's no stranger to "Death."
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: He's just surprised that it has resurfaced.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: This Light Cone... is securely guarded. It must hold some important memories.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: According to Robin's interview, despite having performed on so many grand stages, her favorite performance was a pretend show she put on with her brother when they were just kids.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: I wonder how their relationship is now.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Growing up brings gains, but also losses.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Yeah, time has a way of smoothing things out. The beautiful dreams of youth... will eventually fade away.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: A Letter from Alfalfa
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: To Sunday,I have been informed about Robin, and I would like to express my deepest condolences. However, I must remind you that you now hold the position of not only her elder brother but also the head of the Oak Family. Your every action has implications for all of Penacony.As Penacony is going through a critical period, it is crucial that you do not allow your hatred to cloud your judgment, and be cautious not to engage in activities that others can use against you as leverage. I heard that you are planning to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to find "Death." Such action does not serve the best interests of The Family as a whole, and I strongly advise you to reconsider it to avoid potential impeachments from other family heads.While you are convinced that "Death" is connected to the Watchmaker, I have met that Watchmaker many times long before the Dreammaster adopted you and your sister, and I have never found any evidence linking him to that Memory Zone Meme. Now that you are the head of the Oak Family, it is essential that you assess the situation objectively and consider the bigger picture. It is unwise to allocate all of Penacony's resources and manpower for the sake of a personal vendetta, as this would bring dishonor to the Great One!The Charmony Festival is on the horizon, and the Watchmaker's guests are all barely holding back their own agendas. Neither you nor I could face the severe consequences if Dominicus' arrival is delayed. Therefore, I urge you to control your emotions and fulfill your responsibilities as the head of the Oak Family, focusing only on the Festival and avoiding any interference from external sources. In addition, we must not neglect the honored guests invited by the Watchmaker, as mishandling this matter could lead to diplomatic conflicts with other major factions, involving us in disputes that could have been avoided. As your elder, I hope you comprehend the gravity of the situation and handle it appropriately.As for the matter of Robin, there would be time to pursue it once the Festival concludes. By then, I will provide you with the necessary resources and manpower in the name of the Alfalfa Family to help you get your revenge.Additionally, I have heard rumors that the Dreammaster is not entirely pleased with your recent activities. I advise you to conduct yourself with caution.Yours sincerely,Old Oti
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: It seems neither the Dreammaster of Penacony nor this Old Oti is happy with Sunday's recent performance.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: They don't seem to care much about "Death"... Instead, they're more concerned about the Charmony Festival and the Watchmaker.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Maybe the other Family heads don't think "Death" is a big deal... One thing's for sure — there's a lot of internal conflict within The Family, and everybody has their own agenda.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: List of Suspects
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: Esteemed Head of the Oak Family,The investigation into all the suspects involved in the "Death" case has been concluded. The findings are summarized below for your review.Respectfully yours,Esmay DrottAttachment:Ryan, a general staff from the Oak Family, short gray hair, leading a laid-back lifestyle, often caught slacking off at work.Percy, a diplomatic clerk from the Oak Family, dark curly hair, suffering from severe OCD, unable to work until his tie is tied and checked five times.Reshi, a diplomatic clerk from the Oak Family, long gray hair, a devoted fan of Clockie, exhibits a preference for the clock element in almost all aspects of life.Connor, a professor at Paperfold Academy, short red hair, rumored by students to be an enigmatic figure due to his unkempt appearance.Doriani, a professor at Paperfold Academy, short gray hair, known among students for bringing cigarettes to class instead of textbooks.Pururu, a researcher from the Nightingale Family, long blonde hair, known for being obsessed with soda and having the research lab's trashcan filled with empty drink cans.Benny, a Dreamscape Producer from the Nightingale Family, curly brown hair, frail and thin, exhibiting an almost fanatical affection for dream construction.Maureen, a Dreamweaver from the Nightingale Family, short gray hair, standard stature for Pepeshi adults, possesses a collector's fetish, particularly fond of mugs and jugs.Sir Whittaker, the head of the Nightingale Family, short black hair, distinguished by his rare orange pupils.Patt, a renowned actor from the Iris Family, short gray hair, featured in numerous classic films and TV shows, known for his distinctive thigh band.Borridge, an actor from the Iris Family, short black hair, frequently cast in gangster-themed films, widely acclaimed for his performances in close-quarters combat scenes.Nader, a drinksmith from the Iris Family, short blond hair, enjoying a good reputation among tourists for his engaging conversations.Carrie, an actress from the Iris Family, long pale hair, known for crossdressing in films to play suit-clad male protagonists, affectionately called by her fans as the Gray Beauty.Brendan, a guard from the Bloodhound Family, short brown hair, awarded a medallion for rescuing ten stranded tourists in an incident caused by a meme.Carter, a security officer from the Bloodhound Family, short blond hair, small stature, often spending his leisure time at casinos in the Moment of Stars.Woolsey, the captain of Bloodhound Guardians, short blond hair, a stocky man bearing several scars from previous encounters with memes.Olomu, a detective from the Bloodhound Family, short black hair, known for his unkempt stubble and excellent undercover work and investigations within underground gangs.Corinna, an agent from the Bloodhound Family, long gray hair, nicknamed "Fireball" by underground gangs due to her tendency to wear all-red attire while enforcing the law.Melanie, a reporter from the Alfalfa Family, short blonde hair, standard Pepeshi stature, exhibiting a mental age beyond her actual years.Gabe, a gambling agent from the Alfalfa Family, short black hair, standard Pepeshi stature, used to enjoy a candy before a gamble starts.Lothric, a hotel butler from the Alfalfa Family, dark curly hair, tall stature, possessing a sense of humor that attracts numerous VIP customers.Lester, an auction trader from the Alfalfa Family, gray curly hair, medium stature, regularly indulging in a Sweet Dream Special after work.Gnaghi, a project manager from the Alfalfa Family, long blonde hair, a shorter-than-average Pepeshi, maintains a calm demeanor that has generated a lot of revenue for The Family....*There are a total of 52 suspects on the list, followed by Sunday's note. "Perhaps there is a common thread among them. I have reached a conclusion."
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Mr. Sunday has done some serious research on his suspects... This traitor must have been causing trouble for The Family for a long time.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: They all seem to be insiders... but I haven't met any of them.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Huh? Wait, these characteristics...
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: What is it?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: No, nothing... Maybe I'm just overthinking things... However, if this traitor really exists, could they be responsible for Firefly and Robin's deaths?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Perhaps that's why Sunday is taking this matter so seriously.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: That's all for now... Nothing more noteworthy.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Before coming here, I had all sorts of scenarios in my head about dealing with The Family... I did not expect an empty mansion...
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: ...Watch out. Someone's approaching.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: I don't think trespassing on forbidden areas is the way to be a guest, Mr. Yang, and...
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: ...Acheron, the Galaxy Ranger?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Our apologies, Mr. Sunday. Nobody came to greet us, so we entered without permission. I hope you can forgive us.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: But even if there's no one to greet you, you should wait for the host, don't you agree?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: Even without the famous Galaxy Ranger... as far as I know, the Crew has officially accepted The Family's commission, so coming here will be unnecessary for you.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: On the contrary, that's exactly why we're here. To ask you about the case and gather more information — we don't want any loose ends.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: ...Well, since you've come with goodwill, I have no reason to show you the door.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Acheron]: Rest assured... He hasn't figured out that we went through those documents.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: While the truth remains a mystery, I'm getting close to it. I assure you that the traitor will soon pay the price.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: Let's hope justice will prevail soon. I have a question for you, if you don't mind: How did The Family come to the conclusion that the murderer was within The Family?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Welt]: With all due respect, it's in the IPC's interest to wreak havoc before the Charmony Festival... and The Family has every reason to suspect the IPC's involvement.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: Well, other Family heads share the same suspicions as you, but in my opinion, the true murderer would never have drawn as much attention as that ambassador did... Not to mention I personally shackled him a while ago.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: However, I'll give you a suggestion regarding your suspicions, Mr. Yang. You should be more cautious of Aventurine... While the wicked can't break through high walls, they can plunge their evil dagger into the heart of the righteous.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: He's a businessman, not some philanthropist. But right now, he's out there handing out his wealth on the streets, and he went to the Clock Studios Theme Park all by himself. Who knows what kind of scheme he's cooking up...?
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: While The Family is dedicated to keeping our guests safe, it might be wise for you to stay alert.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Sunday]: You never know... what unexpected troubles could arise.
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: Switching to Aventurine's POV...
[The Tell-Tale Heart][Narration]: Aventurine seems convinced that he has obtained some key clues and victory is at hand. However, can he really last until the moment he climbs onto Clock Studios Theme Park's stage?

[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "...According to a Pier Point hotline tip, there was a major breakthrough in the shocking Egyhazo Aventurine case. The suspect has been arrested..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "This fraud case has been linked to many departments within the Interastral Peace Corporation and the Intelligentsia Guild, causing a large drain in manpower and resources, resulting in the IPC taking a massive loss..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "The case's main suspect originates from Sigonia-IV, and is one of the survivors of the Second Katica-Avgin Extinction Event, who does not carry an Interstellar Refugee Travel Permit..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "As per Strategic Investment Department head Diamond's sentiments, the IPC has appropriately relocated the suspect in the spirit of the Charter, and will continue to conduct further investigations as to the motive of the suspect..."

[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: What pretty eyes. Tell me, do they shine in the dark?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: Well if they did, I'd sell them in a heartbeat.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: You don't know how many people long for your eyes to be closed forever. As a servant, you should not resist your master... Yet you went and killed that man anyway.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: No lawyer has the audacity to defend you, perhaps you ought to represent yourself?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: Not difficult. But definitely pointless.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: You're pretty confident on your eloquence. Did you also think that when you lied to the Intelligentsia Guild?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: Ask and you shall receive. You wanted the perfect construction material — all I did was offer a possibility. It was just a small wager.
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: If your luck holds out, the IPC will dig something up from the golden sands of Egyhazo, maybe even the Sand King's remains. Pity, your luck has run out.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: I'll admit that. What I'm more curious about though, is why such a grand scheme failed to benefit anyone in the end, including the perpetrator himself?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: Madam, I already have what I want — to be brought before you, for the next high-stakes gamble.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: Then let's talk about the second gamble. Tell me, what are you prepared to wager this time?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: My life. I bet you won't send me to the gallows.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: Hmm... What do you want then?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: I want your Lanor to meet with me. I have something to say.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: And then what?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: I want cash.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: It can't be that simple, can it?
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: It is that simple. Thirty Tanbas — the remainder of my... market value. Thirty Tanbas, no more, no less.
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: With this money, I'll climb to even greater heights than you, grasp even more riches than you... I wager you won't give me this chance... which is why you should call him here.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: Interesting.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: A pity Diamond won't see you. No one gets to see him. From here on out, I am Diamond's representative, and I will decide on his behalf.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: You're wrong. Thirty Tanbas... I'll give you that, and much more than that. Wealth, status, power... the IPC will give you whatever you want, even what you don't want.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: Kakavasha... A good name, but unfortunately destined to be buried in the dirt. You though, you deserve to live, to create even more wealth for us.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: Go, pick the clothes you like, then choose your desired identity... and then use them well, child.
[All the Sad Tales][Jade]: May your schemes be forever concealed.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Life is like a long-term investment. Those who choose correctly, do the correct things, reach the correct outcomes, show the world their value.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: People can't always make the right choices in their lives, but luck has always been on my side. I've never lost.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Is it because Gaiathra blesses me? If that's the case, SHE must also be looking upon me right now. My success is inevitable.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...But, what then?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Even if I overcome this difficult trial, what would come next? What awaits me after this glorious gamble... an even more glorious one?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Will I return triumphant with unending riches after countless successes, or will I encounter failure...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...never to return?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: I'm pretty sure you already have some ideas...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...Lowly gambler?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Wh—What?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Am I dreaming, or have I gone completely insane?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Perhaps both.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Forgotten me already? When you were strapped to that electric chair by Iymanikan warlords, who was it that gave you the idea?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Fine... I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid. Get out of my head, newborn of the Harmony.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Heh, the Harmony? Don't play the fool — it's not the first time we've met. No need to be so polite.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: I'm you, and perhaps even more aware of yourself than you, of what exactly you want. You're dying, and you still want to drag a bunch of unfortunate fools with you through death's door... That's why you're here, isn't it?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...A grand unveiling. You really think you can pull it off?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Why not?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Well you may have fooled everyone, but you can't fool yourself.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: I can show you — before you're entirely gone, I'll be with you for the last stretch of your road...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Let's have a heart-to-heart while we walk.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...What exactly are you?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Most people in this world spend their entire lives just to reach one outcome... and I am that outcome.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Kakavasha... I am your future.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: First I'm hearing things, and now I'm seeing them. Great! Am I going to be elevated into the Harmony's Emanator next?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Why are there no guests here? What's that feather-head doing?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Just a Pepeshi... No, a child?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I thought minors weren't allowed in Golden Hour... Hey kid, are you okay? Are you lost—
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: — Ugh!
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: What's wrong, Mister... You don't look well.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Your... eyes?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Impossible. Who are you?
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: They're pretty, aren't they? Sis said they're a gift from Mama Fenge. Colorful eyes are said to bring good luck.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Ah, Mister... You have pretty eyes too. Beautiful!
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Are... you alone? Where are your parents?
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: They're in that amusement park. Papa and Mama went in first. I'm just about to go look for them.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: I have to go, goodbye Mister. Hope you have a good time too!
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Those eyes... and Mama Fenge... No! It can't...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: There AREN'T any Avgins left!
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Papa, Mama, wait for me...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Only on Penacony, am I right?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: What are you still doing here?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You've known all along, if The Family truly showed leniency to everyone who came seeking help, why would there be a need for such high walls and deep moats?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: However, people don't see it like that, especially since the flavor of the dream syrup is so alluring. You will receive no charity on Penacony, and relying on your own strength alone to topple high walls...? Not a likely feat.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Which is why once you step into the hotel, you remove your high hat and beg everyone you come across for help, like a hyena scavenging for scraps in the desert. Because you know that opportunities are fleeting.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: When you put it like that, even Ratio's "Attini Peacock" analogy sounds pleasant.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You know how rare it is for me to give you the straight dope, so listen while you can.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: It's good timing that you mentioned the doctor. I'm especially fond of what you and he have in common, the conspiracies... calculations... especially the part about the finale, a magnificent act of betrayal!
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...When everyone thinks this way, who would even suspect that it was another trap you've meticulously devised?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Go on. Tell me I'm right. You know who you really are, Mr. Cavalier Gambler: Uptight, overcautious, massive inferiority complex. You've won so much, and you're still SO afraid of losing.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: They only see your big bets, your bravado, the full house, the straight flush. They don't know the other hand is below the table, clutching your chips for dear life.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: It's a heck of an act. No wonder the tavern sent you an invite. You're a natural, kid. You don't stop at fooling the audience — you fool yourself too.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: The best way to prevent others from seeing your true colors, is first being able to fool yourself.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Haha, of course, I know you all too well... But, it's strange — why did you decline that invitation? You had the chance to embrace Elation. Was that not what you most wanted? But you chose the IPC instead...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: For the Preservation? Hmph, I doubt it. Do you even have anything in common with the Preservation?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I thought you knew... Didn't you say you had me pegged?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: We're done. Either stop talking, or disappear from my sight.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: That's fine. But, who exactly is about to disappear here?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...It's not going to be me anyway.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Ahh, playing hide-and-seek? I'm really good at this!
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: It's my turn to hide now! I bet you guys can't find meeee!
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Hide-and-seek... What sweet childhood memories.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: When Mama said goodbye that day, how many Katicans were like jackals hot on your heels?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: I know you won't forget that sound anytime soon, those shrill cackles? You had to hide right under the noses of those savages, you and Big Sis, playing dead, drifting in all that bloody water. Completely ruined that shirt. Shame. Wasn't that the last one Dad left behind?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: It wasn't ruined. I've always kept it.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Come on. It's a rag. It's not like you can ever wear it.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Now you don't have to hide. You probably won't even deign to get your pretty outfit wet in the rain... Your social capital has changed, after all.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...I've never changed.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: On the contrary, now you're the one who does the hunting. The last round of hide and seek, and you get to be it. You should enjoy it.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: That child... Could he be in here?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Is this...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: A topaz? What is this doing here...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Uhh...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: What, does her cornerstone wrench at your heart so?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...I was merely curious why it was here.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Maybe that winged guy put it here to taunt you. Just to make you realize that your painstakingly arranged magic show is nothing but a death rattle.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: "The cornerstone's hue is the same as the radiance of Qlipoth's body"... I've got to give it to you, I've heard a lot of baloney, but that lie deserves a prize for sheer nerve. If he were just a little bit smarter, the jig would've been up right there.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: This is just bait.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Of course! That's why Ratio's betrayal was one of the keys to your plan. I have to say, that doctor's acting was superb.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Or maybe he wasn't acting at all?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: All the better for you!
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Sunday didn't become head of the Oak Family by acting sloppy. He's obsessed with control. You have to give him enough detail to satisfy his meticulous nature, but not so much that he gets suspicious.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...Which is why you had Ratio seek him out and leak the plan on purpose — to prevent the other party from suspecting anything. The intel you gave to Ratio was all true, and he spoke the same to Sunday.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Finally, Sunday took the bait, found the other cornerstone, and before you know it...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...Everyone's distracted enough for you to steal the third stone, right out from under them.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Why don't you stop rummaging through my mind.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Your mind? It's our mind. You're me, and I'm you. We're the same.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: "The best way to prevent others from seeing your true colors, is to first be able to fool yourself"... Really? You can't even fool yourself. You just got lucky this time.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: This is the other cornerstone in Sunday's hands. A rather beautiful green, just like you, smooth and cunning...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Tell me, what's its name?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Why are you even asking me?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Ugh, must I do all the work? Aventurine is the stone of luck and trickery... That's what she said when you received the stone, wasn't it?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: This type of stone isn't rare, but its hue is very similar to a certain gem. In fact, it's often used as a substitute. And that more precious gem is...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Jade.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Even Sunday can't tell the difference. It looks like jade can be substituted for aventurine, too. Sauce for the goose...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Aventurine, Topaz, Jade... Three elites, three cornerstones who, for a measly Penacony, offered their everything. You're even more united than The Family.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: As I said before, three chips are sufficient — all, or nothing.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: But will it be the former, or the latter? Hah, we'll find out soon enough.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: So, where's the real aventurine stone? Take it out. Let's have a look.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Heh, suddenly you don't know where it is?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: I just want to hear you say it... After all, it really does resemble its owner.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...As you wish then. They never went anywhere. They're right where they belong...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Piled up with these cheap baubles.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You smashed the aventurine stone before you left...?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...Just look at it, tsk. Shattered, just like your life. Poor thing. A humble pebble coated in the most lustrous sheen. I take it back, this thing is far more precious than your life.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You're absolutely clear about the consequences of doing this? Blasphemy against Qlipoth's body. You think the IPC will let you get off scot-free?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Diamond has always been all about results. As long as I can create value far beyond the cost, the ends justify the means.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: How else would The Family be fooled if there was no price to pay? It doesn't matter — even smashed to smithereens, the Preservation's cornerstone can still be used. Its effect may be greatly diminished, but... it's enough for me.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Now I'm really curious. Why does every step you take involve reckless risks, and the choices you prepare for yourself always come with a strong impulse for self-destruction?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Do you truly believe that the greater the risk, the greater the rewards? I wouldn't have guessed you'd be so loyal to the IPC.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Hmph, there is so much you don't see... Which is also why you'll never see how I'll win it all.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: That is, if you can do what it takes.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...We'll just have to wait and see then.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: The cornerstone is gone... Another illusion of the Harmony.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Huh?
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Hello, we meet again, Mr. Pretty-eyes.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Yes, we meet again. Did you find your mother and father?
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Of course, Big Sis is there too. The four of us were just playing hide-and-seek.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: I'm so happy! On our way here, Papa even brought me to see a flim.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I think you mean "film."
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Yes, that's it. Putting many drawings together and turning them into a moving wall painting.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: They put me, Papa, Mama and Big Sis together, turning us into one big family.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: You should give it a try too, Mister! You look sad. The amusement park will cheer you up.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Sure.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Go give it a try, Mister!
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: How's that? Not a bad score, eh?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Boring.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Why aren't you talking?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You've piqued my interest... I'll admit that there are still aspects of you that I don't completely understand.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: You sound sincere this time, at least.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Sincerity is one of my traits that everybody likes. And I have precious few of those. Moving on! See that maze over there? I'll know everything about you before you reach the exit.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Our quaint journey through this amusement park still isn't over... and I wouldn't mind stretching this out at all.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Woah, this place... it's so tall. Even taller than the tallest rocks in the desert...
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: And there are so many flowers here. Big Sis, this one's for you!
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Is this...
[All the Sad Tales][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Heaven is a Place on Earth.mp4
[All the Sad Tales][???]: What's on your mind?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: It's got nothing to do with you.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Do you need a hint? These are manacles on you. That man gave you your first job, and you made your first pot of gold... I remember it all too well.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You wrapped that iron chain around your fist, for that is the only tool you could find. Then, in that maze, you...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Shut up.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Oh... You don't wish to face your past? Unwilling to admit that your life is worth only sixty Tanbas?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: From what I see, you refuse to confront it, because it only proves your weakness.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: How could a weak person take such daring risks?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: That's right. You love the thrill of danger... but you refuse to let go of meaningless sentiments. Even in this beautiful dream, the only thing you "dare" allow yourself is death.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: In your hands, those who follow you could've become joker cards. They're far more useful that way. It's not like this is the only place The Family ever cut corners. You could've had tons of action if you weren't so all-or-nothing. All it takes is a meager sacrifice... I bet "Opal" would have resolved this without a fuss.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: A pity you're not him. You wouldn't be in this state if you could just get with the program.... And why couldn't you? Out of professional integrity?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Those techniques you mentioned are highly efficient, but it's not that I don't know about them — it's more like I couldn't care less. Get it?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: What fun is it if the fight isn't fair?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Fair... Heh, you assume your opponents would fight fair in the first place. The odds are obviously not in your favor, so how are you just breezing by? Did that Masked Fool's words awaken something in you?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: She gave me an answer that could turn everything upside down.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Hmph, everything?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You mean, it could make all the cards on the table just... disappear?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...That's cheating.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: If these leaves could be brought back... Would they bloom into new flowers?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Double Indemnity 1.mp4
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Your expression right now is hard to put into words. The lucky charm Mama left you is made from gold. Why did you never consider selling it?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You obviously could've lived a normal life like Big Sis that way. Looking back, that was the better choice.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Mama only left us with two pieces of jewelry: A necklace and a lucky charm. There won't ever be a third piece.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: That's what you always say, but you actually regret it, don't you? That you didn't sell them?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: You can zip it if there's nothing to talk about.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Ha... I know. You must remember what Big Sis told you: You're a child blessed by Gaiathra Triclops and can lead the clan to happiness. So, always remember to protect yourself and never resent the pain and poverty you're going through...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: The words still ring in your ears, don't they? You're a good kid, so you definitely won't have forgotten.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: So you surely won't forget how tragic her last moments of life were, how the piercing laughter behind you felt like it was drilling into your heart... You ran away without looking back, just as she told you to.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Tsk tsk... A lifelong regret, indeed.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Enough... Do you not have anything better to talk about?
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Oh! Shut me down like a champ. Well I guess when it comes to mind games this isn't exactly your first rodeo.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: I think I finally get you. And *whew* you are nuts.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: "In the end, I'll ruin this beautiful dream and create the grandest death." — You've stuck to that, start to finish.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Think about it. There's a Stellaron in play, the fabulous Robin loses her voice, two unsolved murders, cryptic messages from a Masked Fool, and a chance to go head-to-head with Sunday himself... and the only thing to pique your interest is one word — the last word, a word that's right there at your fingertips...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: ..."Death," but whose, exactly?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: We'll know when the dice falls.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: *laugh* Alright then, reserve a seat for me in the audience. I'm curious to see just how capable you are. Still, you never answered my question:
[All the Sad Tales][???]: If you could start over... would you still want to be the child who received Gaiathra's blessing?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: It's so quiet this time. Is he finally gone...? Or am I the one about to disappear?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Finally... made it out of this place.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: We're going home? But I don't want to go back yet...
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: It's so fun here... I want to stay here forever...
[All the Sad Tales][Clockie]: Brother Hanu! Where... are you going?
[All the Sad Tales][Boss Stone]: There's only one place he can be going, whether it's in the past, present or future!
[All the Sad Tales][Origami Bird]: Beautiful dream's about to end! The beautiful dream will never end!
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Mister... Is that you? I hear the sound of leather shoes.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Ah... It really is you.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: I don't know why, Mister, but you always give me a special feeling... that makes me more curious about you.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: It's sad that I can't get to know you more. We have to say goodbye. Did you have fun?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: You're... going back?
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: Yes, I should go home. The day's getting dark, and it's going to rain. I don't want to worry the others.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Your home... Where is it?
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: What a strange question. It's where Papa, Mama and Big Sis are...
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: ...In this dream.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: This amusement park, this beautiful dream, they really are peaceful. Everyone loves it.
[All the Sad Tales][Young Child]: But Mister, why don't you like it?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Because they're not here.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Where are they then?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I don't know.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: You DO know. But there's no point pressing the issue.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][???]: Admit it. You're tired.
[All the Sad Tales][???]: We all are, which is why we chose to stay here. Me... and him.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Your past... and future.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: How long will you stay?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Forever. We'll be with you, forever in this dream.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": ...This is the greatest honor that we can offer to those who hurtle towards death.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": The road less traveled is less traveled for a reason. But you've never gone in any other direction. Your own life is the chip you're most eager to lay down. Always has been.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": You don't care who the real murderer is. And the Watchmaker's so-called "legacy" couldn't be more boring. What you want, what you need, is to be the smooth operator — the solid gold deal-maker who doesn't waste a drop of sweat even when he's up to his neck in danger, deep inside Family territory. You want to be polished up, cuffed with red-hot chains and spotlit center stage...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": You'll be the closing act! The final sacrifice.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...I can do it, and it will be flawless.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Of course you can. Your luck will help you at the right time — a Stellaron and an Emanator... It's that simple, no?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": That way, the IPC will earn a place at the table. And as for you, you'll just happen to slip the leash, leave the rat race, extract yourself from this endless debacle. You'll have the freedom you've always dreamed of.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": This isn't the first time... you've been an escape artist from day one. This fiasco started with a "Death," and its curtains will fall on another "Death."
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": ...So, that's why Diamond chose you?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: He's just after Penacony, no matter the means, no matter the price... It's not personal.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": It's hard, isn't it?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Don't get soft on me now. What, did you suddenly grow a conscience?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Hey, I was born from your self. I'm well aware that climbing out of the hole you've dug is basically impossible.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": I can't stop you from doing what you want, and... we can't change where you want to go.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: What's done can't be undone. All we can do is play the cards we're dealt, and rake in as much time as possible.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Yes. Alas, people won't make all the right choices in their lifetime... Though luck always seems like it's on your side.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": You will keep winning, having never lost before. But why you? Why... must it be you?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": If all your luck is built on the pain of someone you love, on the loss of dozens more — if these windfalls, these jackpots aren't a gift from Gaiathra — if all they are is a long string of meaningless deaths...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": ...Then what did we do to deserve living in a world like that?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Maybe... maybe when I get to where I'm going and look back, I'll know what the trip was all about.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Hmph... Fine. Time to make a move, my friend. I'll be waiting up ahead.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": Say goodbye to the kid before you shuffle off. It's...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Aventurine": It's best to die without regrets.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": And now... only we are left.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Can you take a photo for me? I want a memento.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Sure, come on.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Can you take a photo for me? I want a memento.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": How nice! Now I can see what I look like too.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Look at the lens when you're taking a photo the next time — your expression will look more natural.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Sure, I will. Then... Mister, are you going back too?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I can't leave yet.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I still have... a show to do.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Oh... You're about to go on stage, aren't you?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Let's go then. I'll take you to the stage.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Sure.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": So you're an actor... No wonder your clothes are so stylish.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: I'm actually a... merchant. But I do have a show to do.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Are you the same as those men in black in the sky? But you're not wearing black.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Only ordinary employees have to wear that. My position... is much higher than theirs.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Awesome, I hope I can become as good-looking as you when I grow up.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Of course you can.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: You'll be better, and stronger than me.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Behind this curtain is the grand stage...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": It's almost time to go on stage. Are you ready? Good luck with your show.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Thank you.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": You still seem pretty nervous...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Let's put our palms together. If you receive Gaiathra's blessing, you'll feel more relaxed.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Putting our palms together is a simple ritual. By putting our palms together and reciting the prayer to Mama Fenge, SHE will bless us.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: "Kakavasha": If you are not familiar, I can guide you.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: It's alright. I know how to do it.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Of course I know.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Media]: Trailblaze Mission All the Sad Tales 2.mp4
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: This is where we go our own way, Kakavasha. The Katicans are coming.
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: Why? The Katicans have already taken all our money, food, and they killed our parents... What more do they want?
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: Katicans are bloodthirsty, cruel, and insatiably greedy. They want everything, only to end up with nothing.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: This is a trick, an act of revenge. Remember? Today is the day of the Kakava, and also your birthday.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: They know the Avgin will surely hold a festival today. With the aid of this rain, they will come to destroy our wagons and take everything they want.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: Little do the Katicans know, this time we will fight back! The men in black that descend from the skies are on our side. The Katicans stand no chance against them and will surely pay for their arrogance.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: Without this rain, the Katicans would never take action, and we would not have the chance to turn the tide. This is a gift from Gaiathra, and you are Kakavasha, whose good fortune will bless your sister with success.
[All the Sad Tales][Kakavasha]: But... but people will die, and you will be in danger... How is that good fortune? Why are you all doing this...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: The Avgin always return their blood debts. Gaiathra calls for me, while Papa and Mama are waiting for me. I must answer the call. But SHE will bless you with good fortune and help you survive.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: As long as you are alive, the blood of the Avgin will never run dry. So run, Kakavasha, do not be afraid, and do not look back. Go to the other side of the mountain. The rain will accompany you, and the rain will bless you.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: As for us, we will reunite in Kakava's next aurora.
[All the Sad Tales][Media]: Trailblaze Mission All the Sad Tales 3.mp4
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: "May the goddess Gaiathra close HER eyes three times..."

[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: "Let your journey be forever peaceful... "
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Kakavasha's Sister: "...and your schemes forever concealed."

[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "Newsflash from the Interastral Peace Broadcast: The IPC Marketing Development Department's spokesperson confirms that a small-scale rebellion has broken out in the unclaimed region of Sigonia. The situation is now under control..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "The insurgents are from a local clan known as Katica, which has a long history of disdain towards the IPC. This has caused a serious negative impact to the work of the IPC's Marketing Development Department..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "The clan launched a massive attack on the Avgin, who were under the protection of the IPC, resulting in 6,728 deaths and 3,452 missing. The casualties are currently under the care of the Frontline Trauma Team..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "The spokesperson expresses his deepest condolences for this devastating humanitarian disaster, at the same time delivering an important message on this matter to all interplanetary citizens..."
[All the Sad Tales][Interastral Peace Broadcast]: "Finally, he proclaims: 'The hammer of Preservation will fall for all beings, regardless of life or death, regardless of race, regardless of ideology, to uphold the basic rights we inherently possess.'"

[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Kakavasha?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Bye.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Go on stage.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Okay, all the actors are in place. It's time for the show to begin.
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: This act is dedicated to you. I hope it'll be an unforgettable memory for you...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: ...Kakavasha.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: ...
[All the Sad Tales][Sunday]: By the way, before you go, I have a personal question.
[All the Sad Tales][Sunday]: You... do you truly want to destroy the world with your own hands?
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Let's assume — just assuming, now — that every time I roll the dice, there is a possibility of achieving this particular outcome...
[All the Sad Tales][Aventurine]: Then, I would be quite happy to make that wager.
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[All the Sad Tales][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: Is this Miss Acheron? Hello, I'm Himeko, the Astral Express' navigator.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: Hello, I'm March 7th! I'm sure  needs no introduction, as you definitely know .
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Hey, I still deserve a proper intro!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Pleasure to meet ya, Miss Acheron.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: You can call me Clockie.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Hello. None of you seem surprised by my arrival.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: Since Welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I envy your close friendships.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Miss Acheron here doesn't present a danger, and she's of no threat to the Astral Express. Aventurine's prior accusation was based on nothing more than his own subjectivity.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Which is why, before we continue working together, he has a duty to explain himself.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: You want to... create a situation where all three parties are present?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: There must be some deeper meaning behind Aventurine's actions. I suspect he's been aware of Penacony's secret from the beginning... and has been continuously strategizing to unveil it.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: In that sense, the Astral Express' role in his plans would be imperative. In the worst case scenario... he may use us to do something unexpected.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Assuming things do escalate to that stage, having an extra ally is a good insurance policy. Penacony has numerous factions, and the state of affairs is significantly more intricate than that of Belobog and the Xianzhou.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: But we must mete out justice for the dead.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: is right. No matter what, we cannot ignore the safety of Penacony.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Maybe we should now get outta here while we still can?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: also makes a good point. We're completely in the dark on what's going to happen next...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: But, I think we can't just ignore the safety of Penacony.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: I Am the Bone of My Bat. Stellaron Is My Body and Trailblaze Is My Blood.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: You're talking weird again... But it's a good vibe. No matter what, we can't ignore the safety of Penacony.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: To solve the mystery of the Watchmaker, it is crucial to get the IPC's intel. The path ahead is fraught with danger... but what's Trailblazing without a little danger?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Sounds like we've reached a consensus. Now... Miss Acheron?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I will accompany you, of course.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: Let's move out then! But... where do we start looking for him?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: No need to rush. If he truly has laid a trap... he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Ladies and gentlemen...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: The most wondrous, most magnificent show in Penacony's history is about to begin...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: The IPC cordially invites everyone to — Clock Studios Theme Park!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: ...Look.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: Should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of Aventurine's plans be for nothing?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Let's get going, everyone. The hour of trailblazing is upon us.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: To solve the mystery of the Watchmaker, it is crucial to get the IPC's intel. The path ahead is fraught with danger... but what's Trailblazing without a little danger?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Let's get going, everyone. The hour of trailblazing is upon us.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I envy your close friendships.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: Mm... I have a bad feeling that something big's gonna go down. , are you ready?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Ready.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: Let's waste no time and head to the theme park then!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...Mr. Yang.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Why did you not tell your companions about my true identity?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: It's just like you said: An inability rather than an unwillingness. Plus it's a long story... not something that can be summed up in a few words.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: But I chose to believe you, and my trust in you stems more from... my own personal judgment.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: I also believe that, if it were their choice to make, they would make the same one.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Thank you, I'm grateful.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: To reciprocate, in the upcoming confrontation, if the odds aren't in the Astral Express' favor... I will stand with you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...If my meager strength is required.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Wait...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: Your trauma isn't getting to you, is it... Take it easy. It'll be fine.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: We're back here again. Aventurine actually chose a really conspicuous location...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: That guy's really taking it to a whole new level. Does he really think he's a superstar or something?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: Not a soul in sight? The Hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: Everyone, pay attention. The other party has obviously come prepared.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Ladies, gentlemen, dream seekers, tycoons, esteemed guests of the Watchmaker and The Family...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...Also not forgetting the Nameless of the renowned Astral Express! Welcome to the Interastral Peace Corporation's live show!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Astral Express, you're late, and this... "unsought guest."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: We've kept your appointment, Mr. Aventurine. It is customary to show yourself as well.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I will, naturally. But before that, I've got to introduce our guest of honor.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Everyone give it up for...  Stellaron!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: We're not here for any pageantry.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Does this have anything to do with the wanted murderer?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Mommy, look! I'm on TV!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][March 7th]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Welt]: Let me remind you that in all likelihood, this stage and  identity have nothing to do with the wanted murderer.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Oh no, they do, of course they do. Otherwise, why would I work so hard to gain your trust and then invite you all here?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Because  is the only one who saw all three homicides.  is the key to proving that The Family's "death does not exist in dreams" promise is nothing but a sham!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Himeko]: Three homicides?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: That's right, madam — the third one is about to happen right now, right here in Clock Studios Theme Park...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: A truly grand death.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: You, you, you, and you... All of you are going to die! And it's all because of you,  Stellaron...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...You will become the personification of "Death."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: What are you on about?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I thought my intent was crystal clear...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: You sure you're gonna survive this?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Don't underestimate the Preservation. The cornerstone of the Amber Lord will surely guide me...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: I ain't that powerful...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Never underestimate yourself. Like I said, you have the power to turn the tide on the entire game...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Let me be a little clearer: I will detonate the Stellaron in you, and cause a teeny-tiny accident on Penacony...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Bam! The entire theme park will be reduced to a shattered dream. Then, before The Family can even react, I'll become the IPC fleet's navigator.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Your bluff isn't fooling anyone. If you could really do that, you would have done so earlier.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: You wanna bet? Sure, I'll bet with you. I'm betting that it'll be a sweeping victory for me, by detonating an unprecedented explosion to prove that the vow of Harmony is a complete and utter joke.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...You won't do it.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Of course I can. It's just another gamble.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I came from the wastelands of Sigonia. For just sixty red copper coins, people paid to brand me, put me in chains, place me in the gallows, and bury me in the golden sands...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: But the sun could not kill me, and the quicksand sent me back to the embrace of the Guild and the IPC. Bear in mind, my victory wasn't just a stroke of luck — I've never been defeated.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Have you ever heard the saying "Sleep is the rehearsal of death"? Why does life slumber? All because we are not ready for the final rest.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Every night is practice for the end. You and I are escaping into our dreams for fear of death at this very moment. And "Death"... will surface in our dreams.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Friends, the game has commenced, and you cannot choose to decline...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...Nor do you have any reason or grounds to.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: The dice are cast — Ladies and gentlemen, ready to unveil your cards?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: The Architects' flawed stone...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Of no value at all.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'm putting down the bet.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'm taking the gamble.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'm claiming the win.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'll let fate spin the wheel, a daring gamble. Walking the brink of death... for rebirth.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: All for the Amber Lord!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Alright, let's see who has the last laugh — let the game begin!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Even on a losing streak, as long as people still have hope, they'll keep throwing money on the table...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: The chance, no matter how small, the potential is what you hang onto. That's what justifies the gamble!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Everybody's like that, down to the last player.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: So why can't I be happy too? Why can't I feel that free?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Always hide your ace with a straight face...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'm starting to get a bit impatient with you all.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Friends, to fully relish this—
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'm betting every last chip!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Only by casting aside reason does one truly gamble...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: "Emanator"— I know you'll match my wager.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Right?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Media]: Trailblaze Mission When the Sacred Ginmill Closes.mp4
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: You're... leaving?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Mhmm.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Perhaps... I might pass through the place you mentioned.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: Penacony...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: What do you hope to find within a dream?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I'm not looking for anything.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: They aren't in a dream.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: I'm afraid The Family will not open the doors for you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Why?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: Because the path you walk... is not accepted by the Harmony.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Even if... that's not what I want?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: Precisely because it's not what you want. Because THEY are not like other Aeons.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: THEY have never glanced at anyone, and THEY never need to.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: THEY leave woven strands of fate for humans to walk, and together, THEY weave a great shadow... And this shadow silently envelops them.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: There are always those who rise from the shadows.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: They mostly become a part of the shadow.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: In your eyes, am I the same?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: You still have a strand of color...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: ...But not much.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...That is enough.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Before they vanish completely...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I will reach the Nihility's end.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I wish to mourn the departed, weeping like rain, to swell the crossing stream...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...as the tide arrives, leading you back home.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: What... is this place?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: A gigantic black hole, and... sea...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Have... Have I succeeded?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: "...Welcome to this sad world, Kakavasha."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: "Your good luck is the most precious wealth we — all Avgin have."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: "If you come out alive after two days, it proves that you're the real deal."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: "Wealth, status, power... the IPC will give you whatever you want, even what you don't want."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][???]: As for us, we will reunite in Kakava's next aurora.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: It's a pity this is not the place you were expecting.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Nihility... is it?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Perhaps to you, I am just an Emanator who's hiding her identity, but...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: The sleeping and shapeless never glance at anyone. THEY have no face, no form, and even less of a will to speak... The Nihility envelops everyone equally.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Only some who have gone under THEIR shadow can go farther, tainting themselves with more Nihility... That's all.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: That's all... My friend, you really leave me at a loss for words.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: So... Is this my final destination, the land of the dead?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: This is all but a fleeting dream, one of the thousands of manifestations of IX... Under the watchful eye of Nihility, we momentarily linger here, before moving on to our own paths.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: It seems that my death has already been determined.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Even if you wish for it... I can't promise you anything.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Now that you've accomplished your goal, I think you can be a little more forthcoming.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: What do you mean?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Your performance at the theme park was wonderful and grandiose... A simple yet practical technique that fooled almost everyone.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: No one would have ever thought that you would have gone to such lengths, even staking your life, just to prove a fact that had seemingly been disproved long ago...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: "'Real death' does not exist in Penacony's Dreamscape."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...Why would I do this?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Because this is the only way you can uncover a secret that is even more unspeakable than the serial murders...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: To use this "dream death" to get there, to that promised land people constantly seek in this grand gathering...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Penacony — the Legacy of the Watchmaker, the true land of exile.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...How did you find out?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I never imagined that something I learned about unexpectedly would become the key to connecting everything.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: It's that person's identity, isn't it?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I see you're in the know.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Let's just say I'd put money on the possibility.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...The murder isn't nearly enough to disrupt business as usual. Even if there were one or two murders on Penacony, most people wouldn't be personally affected — and that won't create any waves.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: This dream of theirs isn't a boundless sea, it's a lonely island. The Family used the Harmony to build a high wall and isolate them from the vast and treacherous ocean of the outside world.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: That barrier they built "keeps death out," but it also keeps the secrets that are lost in that watery abyss from floating to the surface. In a beautiful dream, free of suffering, who would want to go fishing for those secrets. No one. Unless...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Unless someone goes to the other side of the barrier...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...And lives to tell the tale.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Someone already has.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I got the idea early on, chewing on that Masked Fool's little hint. If a mute isn't "someone who cannot make a sound," then it has to be "someone who cannot speak."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Someone who survived the treacherous depths, but is unable to take the stage and speak the truth. I'm happy to know she's safe and sound, and still on Penacony.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: "Hint" ...is that not "proof"?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Proof is the one thing I don't have. The only thing that can prove these... conjectures... is for The Family to come clean. And with the way they buttered up these outsiders, it seems pretty clear they're intent on covering their tracks.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: But you don't need proof to have a suspicion, and for me suspicion is enough. I didn't need to find the memory zone meme. I just needed for someone to kill me like it killed the silver-haired girl.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: You don't sound very confident to me. Going out of your way to make citywide broadcasts in an attempt to involve more people... You are simply betting on the possibility of someone being able to "break down the barrier."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: You're very lucky that fate has decided to let us cross paths. I happen to be equipped with a very sharp blade — sharp enough to slice through the veil of dreams. I can also carve the Harmony's brand off of you...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: You possess great cunning. Deliberately setting us up to be on opposing sides, constantly repeating the words of the Emanator in front of others, leaving me no choice but to draw my blade against you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: And that's how you win. Opportunity and strategy, both are essential.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: And in your plans, the IPC always wins. Even if you lose the bet... To The Family, the life of an ambassador is still invaluable.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: It's a huge gamble, isn't it? But, allow me to point out a mistake: The IPC's success is not guaranteed — I unfortunately have no contingencies for such an important matter.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Detonating a Stellaron... I can't do it. The aventurine stone is too broken to even safeguard my escape from the stage.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: If at the end of the day you did not unsheathe your blade... I would have lost the bet.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: It is pointless to discuss "what-ifs." You have won. Your prize is an entry ticket into that deep sea.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: And after this, whether you can return from the abyss... is another gamble of yours.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...Have you never wavered?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Wavered? Of course I have. But I can only bank on my own good fortune.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Because other than that, I have nothing.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...Wake up from this dream and go to where you should be. Your gamble... is not over yet.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...Before we part, can you answer one more question? As someone who has traveled on that road, can you tell me...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Why are we born into this world if it's just to die?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: I don't think this, and never have. Nor do you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: But the Nihility envelops you and I... and everyone.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: And because of that, it's pointless.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: But it is still there.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: If the dice of fate are always weighted, then that is our destiny. Why then... do we struggle against it?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...My answer might not be able to resolve your confusion, because it has been with you throughout your journey, and is already a part of your life.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: But you said, "Sleep is the rehearsal of death," so why does life slumber? Because we are not ready for the final rest.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: So you can definitely understand, why we want to be prepared.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Even if the ending has been predetermined, that's fine. There are countless things that humans cannot change.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: But before the end, there are many things that humans can do while on their journey.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: And because of this, the "end" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: Take a good look at your pocket. Your friend has already given you the answer.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Acheron]: ...Good luck.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Doctor's Advice
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: The impossible in the Dreamscape is not "Death," but rather "Dormancy."Do stay alive. I wish you the best of luck.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...Then I shall get going.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Mister...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": You're leaving? You ultimately chose to... leave this Dreamscape?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: ...Yes. Because they are not here... My papa, mama, and big sis...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Then where are they?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: They are in a place where everyone will go. A very, very distant place.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Then are you going too?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I'll get there, one day.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: But not now.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: There will come a day when the sky will drizzle, and I will hear the call of Gaiathra Triclops and know that it is time for me to go and be reunited with my family.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: So until the time comes... I should be preparing.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Preparing for what?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Preparing to face them, Kakavasha, and to make them proud.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": I know you'll be able to do it. Good luck!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Of course. For I am a child who received the blessing of Gaiathra Triclops.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": But you still seem nervous...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: I seem that way because I am nervous. You know what? Maybe you can help...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: What do you say? One last time? Put our palms together?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Are you going now?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: Yes.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Aventurine]: "May the Mother Goddess thrice close her eyes for you..."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Aventurine and "Kakavasha": ...keeping your blood eternally pulsing."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Aventurine and "Kakavasha": "May your journey be forever peaceful..."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Aventurine and "Kakavasha": "...and your schemes forever concealed."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Our paths will cross again beneath Kakava's shimmering auroras.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "Kakavasha": Farewell, Kakavasha.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: "With hope for the morrow nestled in my heart, I descend into the slumber of tonight. Until the denouement of all coming morrows kisses me, I have then embraced the quiet death."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: But this man is different. He lives and breathes in the present. In every sinking night, by every daring gamble, no vision of morrow ever graced his dreams.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: His life knows not quietude. His fate yet demands him to win them all, to weather tempests, one after another... til mire enshrouds his very breath.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: And now, in the unfathomable depths of dream, the once falling die... has at last landed on its earthly rest.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Quietly, peacefully, it at last landed.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Topaz]: The light of the aventurine stone... has disappeared.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Topaz]: This only represents one outcome...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Jade]: He kept his promise...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Jade]: ...And got what he wanted.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Topaz]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Topaz]: As planned, your cornerstone has been successfully sent to The Family's territory. Then—
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Jade]: —Let's fulfill our duty and start "harvesting."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Thereafter, in the cradle of slumberers, deep within the sweet dream of the Planet of Festivities —
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Another stone begins to radiate light.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Jade]: "I come for an audience, I come to fill wine, and I come to claim."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Jade]: "I bestow poison in the guise of sweet dew. Come the toil of spring and yield of fall, I patiently wait for the branches to be heavy with withered fruits."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Jade]: "All for the... Amber Lord."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Meanwhile — Memory Zone Depths
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: You try to open your eyes, but find only blackness before you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Where is this?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: What happened?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: And whose POV is this?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Memories gradually resurface as time rewinds to a few minutes ago]: Aventurine unleashes the final assault, pouring down a dazzling shower of chips, followed closely by Acheron drawing her blade, and then, *crash*—
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: The indescribable force severs the power of Preservation, while time and space froze instantly. Your thoughts twist into a knot as your senses fail, with only gravity tearing at your mind as you plummet into boundless darkness...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: ...until a fire engulfs you in its embrace.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Yes. I'm .
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: I think someone saved me...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Doesn't matter. I need to get out of here.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: ...You're awake.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: I've been waiting on you for quite a while.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: And you are...?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: You've met me before — I'm Sam — the Stellaron Hunter.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: Just what's happening here?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: A crevice between dreams. You've met me before — I'm Sam — a Stellaron Hunter.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Narration]: It's you... what have you done?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: I didn't do anything but wait for you to wake up. You've met me before, I'm Sam — a Stellaron Hunter.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: I originally planned on showing up earlier to reveal some truths to you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: But I encountered more roadblocks than expected. Eleven times, I've tried, but ended in failure. Before I knew it, this world and I became too intertwined and it became too difficult to escape the constraints of the "script."
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: ...Elio is right. In this Land of the Dreams, you and I will reap unforgettable gains.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: I don't know people's hearts as well as he and Kafka do, nor do I have a specialty like Silver Wolf and Blade. Most of the things that I'm good at only apply to villains who need no mercy.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: So, there is only one method that I use.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sam]: This is to show to you...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Firefly]: ...all that I am.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Labyrinth-like corridors and halls, traps everywhere... The owner of this mansion must be a bit paranoid.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: You're so funny, Mr. Security Officer. I hope that sense of humor of yours has helped you find the serial killer.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Just expressing a personal opinion. Why, did I hit a nerve?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: Mr. Gallagher, my patience is wearing thin. Neglecting duties...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: ...will only make me more suspicious that you and the real serial killer are connected.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Scoundrel, punk, drunk, hooligan... I've heard this trash talk all too often. But I have never once thought that I'd be treated as an accomplice to a murderer!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: I take back what I said: Your problem isn't paranoia. You're just crazy, you know? Lunatic.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: You — The Family — you broke my spine and pulled out my fangs, and now you want to accuse me of murder? Ridiculous, only idiots who've drunk too much SoulGlad will berate a stray dog on the streets.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: What exactly is making you say all this nonsense? You should be more concerned about the outworld visitors who are making a scene in the theme park than me!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: I don't need you to remind me. The moment that ambassador walked out the doors of the mansion, I knew what he was trying to do. My servants see everything. His little magic tricks may have fooled me, but no matter, I'm happy to see how things have turned out.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: Why do you think that I just let him go? And why do you think I emptied the theme park stage?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: Because my target from the beginning has always been you, Hound. The more noise he makes, the more opportunities I have to make you and your true master pay in blood!
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: If I were really the murderer, why would you need to be so secretive? Ha, I forgot, you also have a difficult master to serve — telling you to ignore the murder case and focus solely on that Charmony Festival...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: ...Isn't that right, my brother?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: ...Looks like your disguise has helped you successfully understand every facet of The Family.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Disguise? You must be blind to be accusing me of being a fake. Open your eyes and take a good look...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: Indeed, every part of you is real. The brown hair, soft and curly like Benny's; the orange eyes, which make me miss the gaze of Sir Whittaker; that odd scar, the mark of Woolsey...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: And the gray vest, tie, Hound Emblem, bottle, the bartending and your role as a security officer... These are all true traits...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: ...from all fifty-two loyal Family members.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: When they are gathered, countless tiny truths are woven together into a lie — you collected a small piece of each of them and claimed them for yourself. Then you invented this facade, a complete Gallagher...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: ...Tell me I'm wrong, minion of the Enigmata.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: ...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Haha...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Hahahaha! You have guts. I'll give you that! Not bad. I severely underestimated you...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Admirable. But so what? Can this prove that I murdered your sister and that stowaway?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: This proves that you and the Memory Zone Meme "Death" are linked — and that's enough.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: Listen up. I don't care how you did it... I only care about one thing, the answer to a question...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Sunday]: ...You devil! You wretched, despicable dog, why did you kill her!?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: You know, in the thick of things, people are blind to the grit in their eyes...
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: ...yet they can always feel its scratch.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: Want the answer?
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: I'll give it to you.
[A Walk Among the Tombstones][Gallagher]: The whole thing is just fate playing a cruel joke on us.

[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: 12 system hours until Charmony Festival - Astral Express
[The Great Train Robbery][Male Voice]: Newsflash: Penacony's Charmony Festival has entered its countdown phase. Accompanied by Clockie's tick-tocks, after 12 system hours, this grand celebration will commence with much fanfare...
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: Pom-Pom: I already told you! We can talk things out!
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: I'm sorry, fluffy. I really have something urgent to attend to, so I had no choice but to resort to asking this favor of you all.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Since you already know what you're doing, I'll also have to remind you of its risks.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: Hey partner, what's with the hostility? I thought pulling this thing out was just a way of saying hello?
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: For the last time, state your identity and purpose.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: My name's Boothill, and I'm a Galaxy Ranger.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: A Galaxy Ranger?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: You look like you've seen a ghost. Did you think we all went extinct? Haha! Well, that's the price you pay for being off-grid for too long.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: The righteous heroes of The Hunt would never hijack the Astral Express.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: I ain't hijacked anything! What, chatting with someone while holding a gun is considered a hijacking?
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: Pom-Pom: It probably is...
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Pardon my frankness, but there are plenty of rumors in the cosmos regarding the Galaxy Rangers' current status, and none of them are pretty stories. I have a hard time believing you.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: This is hilarious. The tale that this bunch of fools spin is getting out of hand — there's even a bit about the Galaxy Rangers being turned into gibbons by Dr. Primitive, and they're in some valley screwing around on swings.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Of course, I know you won't believe me. Which is also why, similarly, I have a hard time believing that you're the real Nameless.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: See the bullets in this gun? 9-millimeter, an eternal classic. I may need the Astral Express' help right now, but if you're an imposter just like that one... Tsk, then this bullet might just end up in my head.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: I can't allow myself to be exposed to danger. That's just the way it goes. So, you all have to first prove yourselves... Huh, where are you going?
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Recognize this?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Hah? It's a... muddle-fudger... the Jade Abacus of Allying Oath!? The Xianzhou really gave this to you guys!?
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: Pom-Pom: *confused* M—Muddle-fudger?
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: This is the jade abacus gifted to the Express by the Xianzhou Luofu's General Jing Yuan. Its presence onboard serves as the Xianzhou Alliance's official recognition of the Express.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Is that enough?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: ...Not bad, kiddo.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: And across these sprawlin' stars, a gentle squeeze is all it takes to rustle up a whole legion of Cloud Knights. Now I reckon that'd be one fudgin' sight to behold.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Now, it's your turn.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Been ages since the Galaxy Rangers had the spotlight shone on 'em, and we ain't equipped with such fancy gadgets. But I've been around the block enough to know the way to handle these types of situations is easy as pie...
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Alright then, feel free to toss any question my way, and let's see if my answers can't earn your trust. If your gut tells you otherwise, it still ain't too late to show me the door.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: And why would I play along?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: If I truly am a real Galaxy Ranger, you stand to lose nothing.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: ...
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Alright then. Tell me, what kind of organization are the Galaxy Rangers?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Ha, my friend, this question is a hard one. Don't think I can even consider us an "organization" to begin with.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Everyone's on their own fated path along The Hunt, with their own resolute sense of righteousness, and not so... welcome among such so-called universal values.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: This reply does not instill trust, and only makes your predicament more precarious.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: I'm guessing you're gonna ask about some form of shared faith, right? But us Galaxy Rangers don't need that sort of thing. What brings us together is a shared bottom line.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Never bully the weak, never kill the innocent... These oaths aren't some lofty beliefs, but the fundamental bottom line that one must never cross as a person.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: As Galaxy Rangers, we strictly adhere to the bottom line — when someone crosses them, The Hunt's vengeance will surely come knockin'.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: And in this moment, the other crucial meaning of "bottom line" comes into play — as long as you don't cross it, you're free to do whatever you please. You catch my drift?
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Second question: Why do you seek trouble with the Astral Express?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: I already said that I seek no trouble. I must go to Penacony for a matter, but I don't have an invite, and I can't even enter The Family's hotel doors. If only... I could borrow the Nameless' identity. The entire cosmos knows you're guests of The Family.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Aren't the Galaxy Rangers also esteemed guests?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Oh! You've hit the nail on the head... This is why I'm here! It's fine if I tell you — the Rangers are pursuing an imposter, a son of a nice lady posing as one of us. She's on Penacony right now.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: My informant is a Memokeeper. She's the same as all memetic organisms — appearing one moment, and gone the next. She scares the fudge outta me. Still, she gave me some vital info.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: That Galaxy Ranger imposter... Who is it?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Is that the third question?
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: Is it a hard question?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: It isn't, just that you might not believe me. That person calls herself Acheron, and according to our informant, she could be... an Emanator of Nihility.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: That's impossible.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: That's what I said. Don't worry. When I first received the news, I had the exact same reaction as you.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: IX never gives anyone so much as a first glance, and that's perfectly normal. What reason would THEY have to bequeath strength unto mortals?
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Then you must know that Emanators can also conceal their own identities, which, for many people, is better that way. Otherwise, there'd be wanton bloodshed across the cosmos, or even... perhaps... turning their back on the Path they're supposed to follow.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: I had the good fortune of running into an Elation Emanator — its appearance was no different than that of those clowns. If it weren't through sheer luck that I got it drunk, I would have never known of its eminent status!
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: Even in the purest Hunt, you'll find the Xianzhou Alliance under the spotlight and Galaxy Rangers lurking in the shadows. Paths are inevitably concepts created by people, and exist in planes beyond our understanding.
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: To reckon that Nihility Emanators don't exist...? Maybe we just ain't nihilistic enough.
[The Great Train Robbery][Dan Heng]: ...
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: So do you understand now? Your companions are in danger, and it's pretty harrowing. If you don't want to believe me, you'd best send a message to 'em. But I'd advise you to move fast...
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: We don't know what's happening in the Dreamscape, or how much of what the Memokeeper said is true...
[The Great Train Robbery][Boothill]: And that Acheron... Who knows what she intends to do.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: ...I don't intend to do anything.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: That's not up to you.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: Did you know? People who come to the land of dreams for the first time, they'll subconsciously stop to reaffirm that they're still walking on solid ground. And then, they will unanimously raise their heads to gaze at the sky.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: Be it reality or dream, staring at the sky is instinctual for humanity. Since the day that the Golden Hour was completed, it's always been there, watching over every single night of decadence.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: But now this night sky has been mercilessly severed, dyed with the mist of Nihility. And this whole event... happened within the course of a single slash of a blade.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: A single slash of a blade... isn't really accurate. It was actually two blades, just that the second one was faster.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: That's not the point.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: Many guests who weren't supposed to be invited have gathered at this banquet. Even if the Harmony is all-embracing, I have no choice but to show some of them the door... for the sake of Penacony, and the peace.
[The Great Train Robbery][???]: The Planet of Festivities has no place for you, a puppet of Nihility. Those who live in the shadows do not bear the right to tread the illuminated stage.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Speaking of living in the shadows, there's probably not much difference between us. It's only polite to reveal your true self, at least when speaking to others...
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Penacony's Dreammaster.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": That's just another reason that you can't stay.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Whether you believe it or not, this is the real "me."
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": We are one.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Is this the "United as One" that The Family espouses?
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": My mortal shell has long since dissipated. The Oak Family's one hundred and seven thousand, three hundred and thirty-six offspring are now my eyes, ears and mouths, spreading joy across dreams when required, and in times of essential need... exiling evil from this haven in my stead.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: From the sound of it, it seems like you're asking me to leave Penacony.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": I am glad that you're an understanding one. Alas, I'm not "asking."
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: If you think you can.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Are you threatening me?
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Hmm... I ended it with a period. It was a statement, not a threat.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Knowing who I am and still showing such malice, you're not the first, nor will you be the last. This scene played out many times before — and usually, when faced with my questions, most people retort "Why can't I?"
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: The result has invariably been that they "can't."
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": You are confident, but be reminded: The Family is forgiving, but not weak. The chords of the Harmony extend across worlds — if you do not comply, when the blade is unsheathed for even a hair's breadth, you will never be able to escape the Eternal Centurion's wrath in all of your lifetime.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": One hundred and thirty-seven individuals: That is how many heathens I have exiled since I became Dreammaster. Among them, were those who once severed my wings, and those who immolated my body...
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": And here I stand again, about to add another mark to the tally.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: And you will die. I mean... all of you will.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": ...
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: ...
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: ...But that won't come to pass. I'll do as you ask. I'll leave.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": A wise choice.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: I wasn't aware there was a choice.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": To you, that surely is the only option. Please bear in mind, you and Penacony are of different worlds — those born on the far bank cannot seek solace across the river.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Leave, and never return. The radiance of the Planet of Festivities is overwhelmingly bright, luring in tricksters, wrongdoers, and criminals. But even the Harmony itself... will never welcome the Self-Annihilator of Nihility.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": And even more so, when this Self-Annihilator heralds the destruction of everything. Your strength is obviously a gift of the sleeping and shapeless, immeasurable and fathomless, like a tributary spawned from the abyss that brings death and sin to all.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Acheron... a befitting name.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Take it from someone on the other side of your so-called river: You know better than I do that Penacony has already deviated from the Harmony. Whatever your intentions may be... I foresee only one outcome.
[The Great Train Robbery][Acheron]: Its future holds nothing but Nihility, just like all the worlds that have drowned in THEIR shadow.
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: Switching to Robin's POV...?
[The Great Train Robbery][Narration]: Penacony falls into temporary chaos due to the commotion at the Theme Park, and Robin decides to use this opportunity to distribute her little gift...

[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Narration]: At the same time - Golden Hour
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][TV News]: ...Attention, please: The unusual event that occurred moments ago was due to a technical malfunction at Clock Studios Theme Park. The Family has promptly responded to secure the area, and we're happy to report that there have been no injuries.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: I swear that was no movie shoot! So many chips fell from the sky, and I even caught one of them, but it vanished in an instant before my very eyes!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Excuse me, are you talking about the Clock Studios Theme Park incident?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: Hmm? Yeah, what about it... M—Miss Robin!? Am I seeing things right?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Heh, no need to worry. I apologize for any inconvenience caused to your delightful dream journey. What you just mentioned about the chips really piqued my interest. Would you mind providing more details about the incident?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: Oh. It was just... those chips you normally see everywhere — the green ones — they fell from the sky, as if it were raining!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: And then those chips simply disappeared? Ah, it appears... to be the DreamSim Tech the Iris Family has been developing.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: Huh? Miss Robin, you mean... those chips were all part of a performance? But I really...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Shh — this technology hasn't been made public yet. It was originally planned to debut at the Charmony Festival, but it seems it's been leaked.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Can you help me keep this secret? The raining chips... were supposed to be part of my act.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: I—I see! Then it all makes sense now. I'll do anything to help make the Charmony Festival a success!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Thank you! As appreciation, I'd like to give you a token gift.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: This button is...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Press it at just the right moment in the celebration, and there could be an unexpected treat in store for you.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: All right. It looks like there are other guests who are also confused. I'll have to excuse myself — please enjoy the Dreamscape.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: So many people talking about it, this commotion at the theme park definitely made waves...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Narration]: ...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Pepeshi Guest]: Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I can't wait for your performance, Miss Robin!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: The Family promised they would protect the guests within the Dreamscape, but I witnessed a group of organic lifeforms making their way to the theme park, and soon after, a rip tore through the sky, and black rain started leaking out of the void.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: The Family needs to provide a reasonable explanation, or I'll take my loved ones and return to reality. I thought the Dreamscape was supposed to be a paradise. If it's not, then there's no point staying here.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: It appears the good sir has seen many great events, and it's true that an uninvited guest has unexpectedly entered the Dreamscape.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: However, their target is not the ordinary guests, but the ambassadors of the IPC. The Family will certainly ensure that the safety of the guests is of the highest importance.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: Miss Robin. I know the Bloodhound Family has already sealed off the theme park and has control over the situation, but it won't resolve the problem.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: The Family can try their best to protect their reputation, but as a guest, I don't wish to gamble with my life.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: But as you can see, sir, no innocent bystanders were affected in this incident.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Perhaps the Dreamscape is not as perfect as promised. But there's no place safer than dreams under The Family's rule. I believe you know this better than I do. If this incident happened in real life, how many people would be able to walk away from it?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: ...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: I could stay here. But keep in mind, guests come to Penacony to enjoy the Dreamscapes. They do not wish to be entangled in a conflict between The Family and the IPC so, let's not have any more unnecessary incidents.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Of course. With the Charmony Festival about to commence, we will spare no effort in our preparations, rest assured. To express our apologies, The Family has arranged this gift for the guests. Thank you for understanding.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Intellitron Guest]: I could stay here. But keep in mind, guests come to Penacony to enjoy the Dreamscapes. They do not wish to be entangled in a conflict between The Family and the IPC so, let's not have any more unnecessary incidents.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Hello. May I ask what happened here?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: Nothing to be worried about. There's been a small rehearsal mishap at Clock Studios Theme Park. Please stay calm...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: Hey! Are you a fool? You don't even recognize Miss Robin? Who do you think you're talking to?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: Ah? I—I—I—I'm sorry! I've just been transferred to the Bloodhound Family, and I'm still not too used to working on the streets. I didn't realize it was you... I'm so sorry!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Hey, don't sweat it. You guys have a tough job, I know how it is. How's the situation looking?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: We've sealed off the theme park. Most guests are used to bizarre phenomena in the Dreamscape, and so far, no threats have been detected. We can expect order to be restored soon.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: Rest assured, Miss Robin, we'll intensify our patrols to ensure that no incidents occur.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: I trust you guys. But... regarding what happened in the theme park, what do you Hounds think about it? It's okay. Feel free to speak your mind.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: Well...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: Actually, I was there shortly after it happened... Is it true that the IPC's ambassadors came with ill intent? And that Galaxy Ranger who easily cut through the sky...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: Miss Robin, to tell you the truth, everyone has been talking about it. The myriad factions on Penacony have already been causing unease for everyone...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Thank you all for your loyalty towards The Family. The Planet of Festivities has indeed run into some trouble. The representative from the IPC... He's trying to regain ownership of Penacony, and is prepared for a hostile takeover.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Of course, The Family did not agree. The result of the failed negotiations... is as you see it now.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: No wonder. So this is the main reason why the IPC staff are banned from entering the Dreamscape. Did they apprehend the troublemaker in the end?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Don't worry. Mr. Sunday is currently tracking his whereabouts and he'll have something to show for it soon. However, given the situation, the IPC surely won't let this go easily. Therefore, we are relying on you Hounds to maintain the order and stability of the Dreamscape.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: Please be assured, Miss Robin, we take our orders seriously. We won't let those IPC cronies get away with this!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Thank you for your hard work. If there are any other members who still feel uneasy, please tell them on my behalf that protecting the Dreamscape requires everyone's help.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: This is a small gift prepared by the Iris Family for the guests — there's one for you too. Please open it at the Charmony Festival for an unexpected surprise!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: I can't believe I received a gift from Miss Robin... It feels like I'm dreaming! Wait — I AM in a dream!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: If trouble comes knocking on our door, we're not afraid to go to war. Rest assured. The Dreamscape's peace will be protected by the Bloodhound Family!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Rookie Bloodhound Family Member]: I can't believe I received a gift from Miss Robin... It feels like I'm dreaming! Wait — I AM in a dream!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Veteran Bloodhound Family Member]: If trouble comes knocking on our door, we're not afraid to go to war. Rest assured. The Dreamscape's peace will be protected by the Bloodhound Family!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: Miss Robin...? That's the renowned cosmic superstar — Miss Robin!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: I didn't expect to meet a fan here. I'm honored. Welcome to Penacony, a world filled with wonderful dreams.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: I can't believe I'm actually meeting the real Robin... Sh—Shouldn't you be preparing for the Charmony Festival?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Preparation is important, but the ceremony is fundamentally about sharing the Great One's harmony with everyone. If there's a chance to sing with everyone, I will not refuse.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Regarding the recent mishap... I understand it negatively impacted some of our guests. As a member of The Family, it's only right for me to come forward and offer my apologies to everyone.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: But... are you sure it was actually a mishap? Everyone saw those chips descending like rain and the red light tearing through the sky. Claiming it was merely special effects seems a bit farfetched.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: Plus, I met that generous gentleman. He looked really out of it and kept talking to himself. Is this also part of the performance?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Everyone, please do not panic. I believe that The Family will give everyone a satisfactory answer in due time.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: Even if you say so, Miss Robin... It's hard to believe...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: ...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Ugh, some people just never listen, do they? It's never-ending. It just goes on and on... I'm getting really tired of this.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: Miss Robin...?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][???]: Still, I suppose I should keep on helping everyone, I am the epitome of "joy, kindness, and goodness," after all.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: ...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Guest]: Huh, what was I just doing? And who might you be, miss...?
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Sparkle]: Here, take this, little guest. This gift has been specially prepared for you by The Family.
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Sparkle]: Make sure to take good care of it until the opening of the Charmony Festival. Then, when the show reaches its climax — press the button together with the others around you...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Sparkle]: You never know... something VERY exciting might happen!
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[The Fool Always Rings Twice][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: In the meantime...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: We're back to where it all began. You entered the Golden Hour from this place, and it is also from here where you will enter the true Penacony.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: It's a pleasure to journey alongside you once more, but it's time I laid bare the entire truth before you. As you might have heard... I also go by another name: Stellaron Hunter, Sam.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Are you... all right?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I'm fine... Sorry, I hope I haven't scared you.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: You lied to me...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I'm sorry. I had no other choice...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Are you... Firefly's soul?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I know you have many questions... Do you remember when we encountered "Death" in that strange Dreamscape? When I was caught by that meme...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: In that instant before it killed me, I saw the reflection of another Dreamscape in its ghastly pupils.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: So, following the clues in the script, I came up with some theories about the meme. That's why I instructed Silver Wolf to issue invitations, drawing everyone to the dream's hotel...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I intended to call upon "Death" before you arrived, to solve the riddle using more direct means, and then invite you to join. However, contrary to my wishes, I couldn't defy the script, and I didn't get a chance to explain it to you.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: It is how you see now — I was impaled by the bladed wings of "Death." The heavy pressure of concentrated memoria miasma... exploded in my mind, as if it was actually reality.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: But after the momentary numbness subsided, I found that my body was absolutely unscathed.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I was still alive, and it was just as I thought — I had arrived at a place starkly different from this beautiful dream. Beneath the Dreamscape of Penacony lies another more chaotic, more primal Memory Zone. Its name... Land of the Exiles.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: And so then I returned to the hotel in the Dreamscape, hoping to tell you of its existence. Yet I could not reveal my own identity, so I could only divert your party's attention and lure you away from the battlefield.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: And after, all my attempts proved futile. It wasn't until not long ago, when a crimson blade of light shattered the high wall of the dream, causing you all to fall far into the abyssal depths of the Dreamscape, that I was able to awaken you and your companions one by one...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: And that's it, that is all that's happened so far.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: I completely understand!
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: I'm completely confused!
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I know it's tough to believe all this without reservations. I just want to say you're very close to the final answer — just one more thing needs to be done, and then I can prove it to you...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Now, let's leave this place... Please close your eyes.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Take a deep breath, and visualize the Dreamscape's outline in your heart. And remember... you must not open your eyes at all times.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Three...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Two...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: One...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Don't be afraid. The one who has come to greet us... has arrived.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: After a piercing screech, a thick and ferocious surge of memoria crashes into your chest, churning and ravaging. Your consciousness becomes like scraps of paper caught in a whirlpool, breaking apart, dissolving, and dispersing within the turbulent muddy current.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Innumerable voices resonate through the symphony of memoria like roaring thunder, and among them, one echo stands out with exceptional clarity. You know it comes from the girl beside you, your hearts beating to the same rhythm in silence, and then, more silence...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Until memories stir up ripples in that quiet darkness...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Small Town Grotesque 1.mp4
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I never knew you could do this.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: ...Do you have a driver's license?
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: I do.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: That is... surprising.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: Why? Because this is Jepella, the city of sins?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Mhmm, no... it's nothing.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I'm just thinking, you haven't slept in twenty system hours... Are you sure you're okay?
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: I'm fine. I'll survive. Same goes for you.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I'm not so sure about that. Slow down a bit.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: Infiltration is over. Feel free to activate Sam anytime you like.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: There's still some time before the next part of the script unfolds. Let me stay a little longer in this body.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: A long silence ensued. Neither of them brought up any topic, seemingly accustomed to this silence.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: It wasn't until much later that a soft sigh once again broke the quiet in the car.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Such a long tunnel. Didn't feel this long when I set off.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: In half a system hour, it will lead us to Kafka, and then comes the downfall of the Jepella Brotherhood.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Is that also part of the script?
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: It's in your script, too.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Sorry, I didn't notice.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: Their destiny won't change just because of your selective ignorance.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: I told you before, it's a bad habit.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: What about you, then? Is this the moment you finally find the "Death" you've been looking for?
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: As always, it's a blank slate. It's not on this planet. Why the sudden inquiry?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Because I'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver... I just want to get there in one piece.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: This car has full self-driving capabilities. I'll just put my hand on the steering wheel. Will that do?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Hey, don't take everything so seriously.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: ...Elio would always say there's only one type of destiny: The inescapable type. He can see the future, and we... likewise are aware of our "predetermined end."
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: But before that moment arrives, we can still choose what we do... We all have this right, don't we?
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: After today, Jepella's name will disappear from cosmic history, and the Ever-Flame Mansion will take its place. In the not-too-distant future, you'll receive an invitation...
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: That's your next stop.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Land of the Dreams, Penacony.
[Small Town Grotesque][Blade]: I hope you find whatever you seek there, be it answers... or salvation.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: , glad to see you're safe and sound.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Is this...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: That voice just now...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Mr. Yang, you're here too?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: "Close your eyes"... This is the answer. Isn't it incredible? The monster that we have always known as "Death," is actually the guardian of the land of the exiles. It abides by a certain rule, abducting people from their dreams and bringing them here.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: The question that has been perplexing us — "Does death really exist in the Dreamscape?" — appears to be a cognitive trap. It was laid by those orchestrating events from the shadows to cover up the truth behind the disappearances, and the existence of this fortress known as Dreamflux Reef.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Every emergence of that meme is related to the Watchmaker. Since Dreamflux Reef is where it brings its captives, it's likely that many of our longstanding questions will be answered in this place.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: The atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. There are no regulators here like The Family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: But from the whispers of the residents, I've heard a familiar name... Gallagher.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: It's that man again, always in the right place at the right time... though that does save us the trouble of looking for him.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Himeko and March have already made a move. , get ready. We're about to set off.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: :
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I'm really sorry for waiting until now to tell you everything.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Why couldn't you reveal your true identity?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Two reasons: Firstly, the script — in the future that Elio saw, Sam and the Astral Express' confrontation was inevitable. I tried to break the shackles of the prophecy, but this is as far as I could go.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: That aside... there were also my personal motives. I wished to travel with you as Firefly... and not Sam.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: It's all right. I didn't take it personally.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: ...Thank you.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: This is still hard for me to accept.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: I... I get it. Being cautious around a Stellaron Hunter isn't a bad thing.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Do the Stellaron Hunters also want a piece of the legacy?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Elio only gave me one instruction: Allow the Astral Express to pursue the Grand Legacy. It means that the Watchmaker's Legacy holds great significance to Trailblazing, and to you.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Elio's scripts used to revolve and expand around certain specific Stellarons. But with your appearance, this condition has apparently ceased to be appropriate. Perhaps, he also saw the "impossible" in the future.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: So, who exactly is Sam...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Do you still remember the medical cabin I told you about? Well, that's Sam — It belongs to the Iron Cavalry of Glamoth's Firmament Frontline, a Fyrefly Type-IV Strategic Assault Mech.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: It is the cradle of my vitality, and the meaning of my birth. And for the longest time, it was... how I should have looked to the rest of the world.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Let's talk later.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: The timescale of Dreamflux Reef differs from reality, so we mustn't lower our guard. You're sensitive to memoria — A slight misstep, and you could get lost in this Memory Zone.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Something on your mind? Let's talk about it.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Acheron's blade slash...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: No wonder Miss Acheron is so averse to drawing her blade... it's hard to imagine such terrifying power could reside in an ordinary sheath. If it weren't for the fact that Aventurine's power originated from the Preservation, the entire Dreamscape would have been affected.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Don't feel burdened by this. Even without that Stellaron inside you, Aventurine would still have found other methods to accomplish his goal. Let's just believe in Miss Acheron. And given her prowess, I don't think we've got anything to worry about.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: What are your thoughts on Gallagher?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: During your investigation, he shared a vital piece of information. Mikhail, the former Watchmaker who collaborated with The Family to construct the Penacony we're familiar with today, had a falling out with The Family for specific reasons.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: But this is precisely where the problem lies — you were clearly investigating a murder. So then why, as a security officer, is he changing the subject to talk about his past with the Watchmaker?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: And now with Firefly mentioning his name again... it's hard not to be suspicious.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Regarding Firefly and the Crew...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Before we found you, she'd already revealed her Stellaron Hunter identity, and shared a lot of information.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Who would've thought that the Molten Knight's true identity was actually a young girl... For her, this is a secret that she cannot allow others to know. That being the case, I think we can believe she's willing to cooperate.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: But, she didn't reveal all her secrets. I just can't shake the feeling that her situation is different from that of the typical dreamer... And I hope that doesn't lead to any dangerous predicaments.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Let's call it a day.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: I hope you've regained a little composure. We'll move out when you're ready.
[Small Town Grotesque][Muddled Vagrant]: Welcome to heaven... dreams, true or false... all are ephemeral...
[Small Town Grotesque][Muddled Vagrant]: Might as well drink more SoulGlad instead...
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Keep going straight down this alley and it'll lead to an elevator. It'll take us to the center of the land of the exiles.
[Small Town Grotesque][Melancholic Vagrant]: Did you also get kicked out of the beautiful dream? I want to go back... but then, I don't want to go back.
[Small Town Grotesque][Melancholic Vagrant]: Tell me what I should do. Oh... I don't know what to do...
[Small Town Grotesque][Happy Vagrant]: Hi there, friend from a distant land!
[Small Town Grotesque][Happy Vagrant]: I hear the Watchmaker's Legacy is right here! Let's say we go treasure hunting?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: What a huge Clockie... Looks like the Watchmaker also left his mark on Dreamflux Reef.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Unbelievable... to think there's a settlement of this size within the Dreamscape... and all beyond The Family's reach.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: The atmosphere in this fortress is... pretty different from that in the beautiful dream.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: When I first saw it, I was in awe too. The sky here, it's like... a reflection of the twelve Dreamscapes.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: What's even more bizarre, is that this place is also separated into trade and residential areas. The layout may be simple, but the facilities are very comprehensive. It seems that there are quite a number of people living here.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Though both Dreamscapes have distinct styles, the architectural designs are quite similar — works of the same hand, perhaps. Hard not to speculate on the connection...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: But there's no point in overthinking things. Let's meet up with Himeko and the others first.
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: Take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. There are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Not coming with us?
[Small Town Grotesque][Firefly]: The Astral Express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. In the meantime, I'll try and locate Gallagher.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ...Sure, let's reconnect later.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Letting her go was the right decision — further observations are needed before we decide whether to trust her. But first, there's someone I need to talk to.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Let's go, . I'm sure you've already noticed him.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Yep, I saw him right away...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: He's right over there...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Who?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Look, over there...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: A familiar face?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Hehe, not exactly — I've only met him once. Look, over there...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: The Reverie Hotel's bellboy... How did he end up here? And right after Miss Acheron severed the beautiful dream...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: We'd better check, just to be sure.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Ah? You're the guest from before. We meet again! And a new friend... F—Forgot to introduce myself, I'm the hotel's bellboy, Misha.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Hello, Misha. I'm Welt, we met in a dream...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ...Hm? And who might this be...?
[Small Town Grotesque][Clockie]: Tick-tock! Old friend and new friend, let's high-five!
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Mr. Yang, you can see him?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Mr. Yang, you're still young at heart!
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: You're... a Memory Zone Meme?
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Nope. Clockie is a good friend of mine. We all live here.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: How did you two get here? This Dreamscape isn't supposed to be open to the public... I wonder if it has something to do with Sleepie?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: So this is... your home?
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Yep. After my work in the beautiful dream ends, I'll go back home. Commuting used to be more convenient, but ever since travel became cumbersome, Sleepie started ferrying people back and forth between the two Dreamscapes.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: This Sleepie... Can you describe what it looks like?
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Sleepie is a Memory Zone Meme, looks fierce and has many eyes. But it's actually really well-behaved. Gallagher's been taking care of it.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: This description, could it be...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Gallagher again...?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Based on the description, that meme is indisputably "Death." A nightmare for The Family, but for the people who live here... that couldn't be further from the truth.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: D—Death? Not in a dream, surely. Sleepie's just a little aggressive, and sometimes messes up by fetching the wrong guests, but it would never hurt anyone!
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: I see... Has it brought back any guests recently, say in the last day or two? We're currently investigating a missing person case that occurred within the beautiful dream.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: I see... Then you'll have to speak with Gallagher. But he's currently busy hosting a visitor from the Oak Family, and specifically asked not to be disturbed.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Um, Mr. Yang, the person you're looking for...
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Is it Miss Robin?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ...Just as I thought. Considering what happened with Miss Firefly, this doesn't come as a surprise.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: If you're looking for Miss Robin, I can lead the way. She told me that she'd be willing to meet with outside guests.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: If it's not too much trouble. Also, we're looking for our missing companions: A woman with red hair, accompanied by a girl with pink hair. Have you seen them?
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Oh, I haven't... But please rest assured — Dreamflux Reef is a small place, and it's not as bustling as the beautiful dream, but its safety is unmatched.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: How about this! Since it's your first time here in Dreamflux Reef, I'll be your guide and help you find your companions, and then we can all go visit Miss Robin together.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: She's gone to Mrs. Grace's to visit the children. She won't be leaving anytime soon, so there should be enough time.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Alright, then. We'll follow your plan.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Well, we now know the answer to both murder cases that have caused such commotion in Penacony. As for the intentions of the mastermind behind it all... we're still none the wiser.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: It has to be Gallagher who's behind it all.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Yes, that's my thinking as well. I'm not entirely certain, but we still have to find him one way or another.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: That visitor from the Oak Family is worth learning more about.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Yes, and I believe their relationship with Gallagher may run deep — why else would they be so clandestine about their discussion? Regardless, we have to find Gallagher.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: That name, Sleepie...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Uhh, no idea. But its connection to Gallagher is worth digging into. Regardless, we have to find him.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Say, you mentioned before that you saw a Clockie that only you could see, right?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Yep, he's right here.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: He was with Misha at that time.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: You also saw him, Mr. Yang.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: I can't shake off this strange feeling. Am I really still so young at heart...?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Forget it. It's not important. We'd better just follow Misha.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Everyone, look! From here, you can see the most spectacular view of Dreamflux Reef—
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: A black hole? No... an accretion disk formed from consolidated memoria? Was Dreamflux Reef built on such unstable memoria?
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Oh? So Mr. Yang is also versed in memoria dynamics. I was just trying to figure out how to explain this huge hole to everyone. I bet you guys have a lot in common with Miss Kaimee!
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Look, there she is.
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: My calculations are finally done. In another ten system hours, the above dream will swallow the dream below! My hypothesis was correct — this place will cease to exist, as the dream devours everything...
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: Hmm? Who are you all, and why haven't you left yet? This place is about to disappear!
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: What are you doing out here?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Then why aren't you leaving?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Who are you?
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: I'm Kaimee, a dreamscape surveyor specializing in memoria dynamics, and this is my life's work that I'm researching.
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: See that huge gaping hole? It was just a narrow rift many years ago, but now it's grown into a giant hole. The surrounding memoria has been flowing towards the other end of the hole at a constant velocity, slowly but surely.
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: But the scary part is... according to my calculations, the flow rate of memoria has recently changed, and it's faster than ever before — it's almost... almost as if something is sucking it in from the other side!
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: By constantly improving upon Madam Razalina's memoria measurement method, I've finally obtained accurate results—
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: After ten system hours, the Dreamflux Reef will cease to exist! It will disintegrate like a melting glacier and then fuse with the sweet dream fragments on that side of the void!
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Uhh, please don't worry, this sort of thing has happened many times before... Miss Kaimee isn't a bad person, she's just a bit... lost in her own world. She'll probably realize she's wrong soon enough.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: You don't say... There was something else that piqued my interest. Who is Madam Razalina?
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: Oh, do you know her, too? Or are you also a fan of memoria dynamics?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: We're very interested in Madam Razalina's achievements. Could you tell us a little more about them?
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: Why, Of course! She's an excellent scholar of memoria dynamics, and the first person to apply memoria rate measurement methodology on interstellar travelers.
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: Regrettably, due to the presence of the Garden of Recollection, ordinary people don't pay much attention to the nature of memoria. She departed this world without much fame, leaving only a few thin journals behind...
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: I came to Penacony to learn more about my idol, and went to great lengths to seek out Dreamflux Reef, all because this is her final resting place. Prodigies always meet their demise prematurely... If only Madam Razalina had more time, she would've discovered a way to reverse the flow of memoria!
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: I felt it, the source is in... the Golden Hour! There is a certain anomalous presence stirring the currents of the Memory Zone. I must uncover more concrete proof... I must convince everyone...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ..., does the name Madam Razalina sound familiar to you?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: It was one of the Nameless mentioned by the conductor.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: That's right. It seems like she did a great deal of research and calculations in Dreamflux Reef... before abruptly passing away.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Who?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Before we came to Penacony, the conductor had given us a list of Nameless to look into — her name was mentioned. It seems like she did a great deal of research and calculations in Dreamflux Reef... before abruptly passing away.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Miss Kaimee regularly mentions her. I hear Madam Razalina passed away during the Prison War... If she could see the Penacony of today, its people building homes in the Memory Zone... I bet she'd be really happy.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ...Perhaps.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Our destination is the commercial district. That's where the largest crowds gather in Dreamflux Reef. We might be able to find the others there.
[Small Town Grotesque][Kaimee]: I felt it, the source is in... the Golden Hour! There is a certain anomalous presence stirring the currents of the Memory Zone. I must uncover more concrete proof... I must convince everyone...
[Small Town Grotesque][???]: Let me go...
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Please, come to your senses! I'm begging you...
[Small Town Grotesque][???]: Ghost, there's a ghost! D—Don't come near me...
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Oh my, I'm human and so are you. Can you get a grip...
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Ah! There you are! I've been waiting for you two!
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Quickly, come help! I bumped into a member of The Family on the way here. He was so scared and I just wanted to calm him down. But...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: The Family's Member: Let me go. Let me go... I've only done good in my life. Why can't I rest in peace after death...
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: ...Well, this is how it turned out.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: You scared him this badly?
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Ha. Ha. You're a regular comedian...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Now you shall pay respect to March 7th, Ghost of Dreamflux Reef!
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Me!? A ghost? Don't make me hit you!
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: He thinks he's dead... Although when I first fell in, I also thought the same.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Dear guest, this is not the afterlife. This is Dreamflux Reef.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: That's right. Did you hear that? Repeat after me: Dream— Flux— Reef.
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: The Family's Member: You... You're talking to someone invisible. If I'm not dead, what am I? *sob*... I shouldn't have pushed my luck and tried sleeping in my dream... Curiosity kills the Pepeshi!
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: Invisible who?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: What's wrong with sleeping in dreams?
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: The Family's Member: S—Stop asking! You'll alert the monsters! All the dead are right here, all of them...!
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Uh... You're not talking about the Memory Zone Meme, are you...
[Small Town Grotesque][Narration]: The Family's Member: Don't say that name! It's all your fault! Th—They're coming!
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: He passed out. His intense negative emotions attracted the nearby Memory Zone Memes.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: I see... but why aren't the other people around here scared?
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: Unlike in the sweet dream, people here don't see Memory Zone Memes as dangerous monsters... and even if they pose a threat, people can easily escape by forcing a wake-up call.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: But we can't just leave this man here... Can we take him somewhere safe?
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: We can ask Jessie for help! I've gotten to know many locals while waiting for you guys.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Everyone here is living a self-sufficient life... I don't know how to describe it, but this place feels like the real Dreamscape...
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Evening, Jessie! Uhm... is it evening?
[Small Town Grotesque][Jessie]: Welcome, Miss March! Who might these be?
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: These two are my friends! As for the man lying on the ground... he's a scaredy-cat who fainted from fright.
[Small Town Grotesque][Jessie]: Haha, I see, another poor guy who accidentally ended up here. I'll take care of him.
[Small Town Grotesque][Jessie]: There have been a lot of new faces lately. Things must be tough in the beautiful dream. *sigh* The few remaining havens of freedom in Asdana will soon face trouble...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Do such things often happen here?
[Small Town Grotesque][Jessie]: Not really, but they're becoming more frequent now. Guess it's one of the signs of the sweet dream's collapse.
[Small Town Grotesque][Jessie]: This man has had quite the shock. Could you help me find a Halovian lady, March? Her songs can heal mental wounds.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: A Halovian lady...?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: That must be Robin. She's also here, in Dreamflux Reef.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Huh!? Robin? But I thought she... Oh, right! If Firefly is here safe and sound, then it means Robin must be okay, too.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Misha is about to take us to her to find out what happened, but before that, let's meet up with Himeko. You were with her earlier, right?
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: We met some stowaways in the residential area. Most of them came from neighboring star systems.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: I heard that places like Dreamflux Reef are scattered throughout the Memory Zone of Asdana, like islands in the ocean. They existed before The Family arrived.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: I also heard that when Dreamflux Reef took shape, it was the center of all Dreamscapes in Penacony.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: If that's true, it's no wonder there are so many similarities between this place and the sweet dream.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Himeko must be gathering information. Let's hurry up and get going.
[Small Town Grotesque][Jessie]: There have been a lot of new faces lately. Things must be tough in the beautiful dream. The few remaining havens of freedom in Asdana will soon face trouble...
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: This is where we split up... She can't be too far away!
[Small Town Grotesque][Himeko]: So that's how it is... I never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: Hehe... to borrow Gallagher's catchphrase, "what an unpredictable twist of fate."
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Himeko! Here they are.
[Small Town Grotesque][Himeko]: Perfect timing. Now that everyone's here, I'd like to introduce everyone to Micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. Micah, these are my companions.
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: It's a pleasure to meet the Nameless.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: You know us?
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: I've been keeping an eye on you since the day you arrived in Penacony. We would have met under more appropriate circumstances if Dreamflux Reef hadn't been isolated from the Twelve Dreamscapes.
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: Please allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Micah, the Gravekeeper of Dreamflux Reef.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: Gravekeeper...?
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: Life in Dreamflux Reef is pretty liberating. Everyone here mostly keeps to themselves, without meddling in others' affairs. My daily task involves... cleaning a few tombstones.
[Small Town Grotesque][Misha]: You're too modest, Micah. When lost Dreamchasers stumble upon this place, you're the one who takes care of them, guiding them back to the sweet dream or showing them how to survive the wild dream chaos.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: So, a guardian of sorts!
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: Hmm? Were you talking to me, Mr. Yang?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ...Hmm?
[Small Town Grotesque][Himeko]: ...
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: ...On that note, Mr. Micah, which tombstones are you referring to? We didn't come across any graveyard when we arrived.
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: Heh, they're actually just symbolic stones. But since you're curious, Mr. Yang, I'll take you there. I have a feeling you might find something of interest there.
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: But before that, you'll have an important guest joining you.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: An important guest? Who could it be...?
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: This way, please. The roads here in Dreamflux Reef are a bit run-down, so watch your step.
[Small Town Grotesque][Micah]: There she is.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: It really is her... Miss Robin!
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: Everyone sang so wonderfully! It's not often that I try this music style, but I've gained some valuable insights from it!
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: I can't thank you enough, Robin. These kids have made incredible progress in only a few days.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: It was nothing, Grace. I merely taught them how to sing. It was you who brought hope into their lives.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: ...Life must be quite difficult for them in reality, I imagine.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: That's right.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: Whenever it's time to say goodbye to these kids, they're reluctant to leave. But, I've explored every corner of Dreamflux Reef, talked to everyone I met, and they all told me the same thing... This shattered dream is not worth clinging to.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: Hehe, it seems you truly are a child of the Harmony.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: Emma and Andy are orphans I took under my wing. Carol, there, with her blind eyes, used to work at a nutrition center in the outer ring of Penacony. And as for Gary, he's been living with autism since he was a child. They're not old enough to enter the sweet dream managed by The Family.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: If we compare people to birds, these kids are like fledglings with impaired wings. But in this dream, they can fly freely. Even if they stumble along the way, they're still relying on their own strength.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: And me? An old lady with no legs... Without this dream, I couldn't even walk toward them.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: I'm glad that you found a new life here in Penacony, it's just...
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: Don't worry, Robin. Dreams have their significance, but they aren't everything. Both the children and I understand this. No matter how long we fly through this dream, we will one day return to reality.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: But you know what? Emma and Gary aren't plagued by their insecurities anymore. No — and Carol is learning how to cope with her blindness. And Andy is livelier than ever. Well, even I've become more optimistic.
[Small Town Grotesque][Grace]: You see, in dreams, we learn how to live. Once we return to reality... we learn how to survive.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: ...And should our feathers be damaged, then we share our wings with one another.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: There's no need to covet an illusory sky in dreams, because we have the right and the ability... to fly towards a broader horizon.
[Small Town Grotesque][Himeko]: It's a relief to see you safe and sound, Miss Robin.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: It's nice to see you all again, Astral Express crew. I heard my disappearance caused quite the commotion out there... I'm really sorry about that.
[Small Town Grotesque][Himeko]: Since you're here... can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in Penacony?
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: Ever since I returned to Penacony, my voice started to change, until it gradually faded away. At first, I thought it was a temporary ailment, perhaps due to having been away too long. I thought maybe it'd just take some time for my body to acclimate to the high concentration of memoria in Asdana.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: But now it seems... the root of the problem goes way beyond me. There are elements around me that don't align with the Harmony... and losing my voice is just one of the signs of the sweet dream's collapse.
[Small Town Grotesque][March 7th]: The sweet dream's collapse... that Memokeeper mentioned the same thing. So, it's real.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: While I was away from Penacony, the boundaries of the Twelve Dreamscapes kept expanding outward. But whenever I mentioned the anomalies in the dream... all The Family heads refused to talk about it. Only my brother was willing to respond...
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: Later, I discovered the secret letters from the IPC ambassador, which further convinced me that there are hidden secrets beneath the surface of Penacony. So, following the clues in the Oak Family's dossiers, I found my way here...
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: ...The land of the exiles, concealed by The Family under the guise of "Death," a dream within a dream where Penacony's past is buried.
[Small Town Grotesque][Himeko]: Hearing you speak, it sounds as if your voice has made somewhat of a recovery.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: I hate to admit it, but the "Harmony" in this place resonates more broadly than within the sweet dream...
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: It's regrettable, but The Family has experienced betrayal. The traitor, or traitors abandoned their original principles and, using the name of Harmony, exploited people's weaknesses to turn Penacony into the Planet of Festivities, trapping everyone in the illusion of the sweet dream...
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: This is not "the strong defending the weak," but rather "the strong exploiting the weak." A world without equality won't ever be favored by the Harmony, and naturally, those voices blessed by THEM... have lost the ability to sing.
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Could there be another force influencing The Family's shift in philosophy, Miss Robin?
[Small Town Grotesque][Welt]: Considering what happened with Acheron, it's difficult to conceive of another entity within the realm of the Harmony capable of influencing everyone, unless a power surpassing that of an Emanator is involved...
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: I'd heard about what happened to the Xianzhou Alliance. But as far as I'm aware, The Family hasn't faced any such external interventions. Who knows, perhaps I've just been away too long and missed something.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: Regardless, I cannot accept my home is moving towards the very opposite of what the Harmony represents, while still claiming to uphold it.
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: I must uncover the reason why Mikhail cut ties with The Family, and who exactly it was who betrayed us all. Do you remember our arrangement, Mr. Micah? Well, here's my answer...
[Small Town Grotesque][Robin]: — I've decided to forego my role, and never step foot on the Charmony Festival's stage again.

[The Public Enemy][Narration]: 11 system hours until Charmony Festival - The other side of Dreamflux Reef
[The Public Enemy][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Small Town Grotesque 2.mp4
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: Look here, brother! A little bird!
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Looks like a fledgling Charmony Dove.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: But Charmony Doves don't live here. So how did this little bird get here? Maybe its parents abandoned it?
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: It looks weak and frail... Why don't we find something soft and make a nest for it?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: This place is too dangerous for a fledgling. Let's take it with us — we can put it on the wooden shelf in front of your window.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: Okay! A bird like that must have a beautiful singing voice. But where will it live?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I'll ask the family head to build a cage for it.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: A cage... but then it won't have the freedom to fly, right?
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Let's see... what is it that has captured the attention of the two best interpreters of the Great One, to the point that they've forgotten how to enjoy their dessert?
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Oh... poor little thing. Doesn't look like it's doing well. Do you want to rescue it?
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: I do... but I don't want to lock it up in a cage.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Why?
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: Even if it's small and not fully feathered, and can't sing... it didn't come into this world just to be locked up in a cage.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: Birds... belong to the sky.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: That's quite the romantic idea. And what about you, our young scholar? Do you agree with your sister?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I think she's right... but if we leave it out in the wild, it won't survive for more than a few days at best.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Ah, I see. It seems our little scholar is still a bit unsure. Well, let me tell you youngsters a story.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: As you probably know, Charmony Doves can fly through the air. When they fly really high, the friction caused by the flapping of their feathers against the atmosphere creates amazing lights, so that they look like shooting stars.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: We've seen this spectacle so many times that we think it's just something they can naturally do... but that's not the truth. Their radiant display is the result of countless struggles against nature over generations.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Their ancestors were too weak to survive on the ground. So, to escape predators, they started seeking new opportunities in the air...
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: After countless attempts by many generations, one of them finally figured out how to fly. It soared into the sky and never looked back at the ground again.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: So, you mean, birds aren't born to fly, but they find a way to do it through their determination, right?
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Well, that's an idealistic way of putting it. So, what are your thoughts, Sunday?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I think people believe birds are meant to fly because... they've never seen those birds crashing to their death.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: That's an interesting perspective. So, have you decided what to do with the bird now?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: For now... I'll keep it in a cage until it can take care of itself because...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I... I want it to live, no matter what.
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: Well said, kids. It seems each of you has found your own answer. Your insights are truly remarkable, and I hope they come true in their own way.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: We will take good care of it, won't we, brother?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Yeah, but Mr. Gopher Wood, there's one thing I don't quite understand...
[The Public Enemy][Kind Voice]: And what might that be, my son?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: What if this little Charmony Dove never learns to fly in the end?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I mean, if there are fledglings in this world that can never fly throughout their lives...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Should we let them go back to the sky... only to see them crash to the ground and die?
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Talking in your sleep, birdie? Time to wake up.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: You look a little unsteady. Need a hand?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I'm still alive?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Yeah, happy about that?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: ...Where is Robin? Tell me. Now.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Heh, I knew that was going to be the first thing you'd ask.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Don't worry. Your sister is here, safe and sound. She's... probably walking around the streets now.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: If I were you, I'd be more worried about myself... After all, right in front of you is the guy who just stabbed you in the chest with a dagger.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: If you wanted to kill me, you wouldn't give me the chance to speak... Just tell me your demands, lackey of the Watchmaker.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: So, you've figured out who I am, huh? No wonder you had the guts to go against the Dreammaster and the four Families. Looks like I made the right choice.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Choice?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: You are aware of my plan and see through my Fictionology. Time is running out, so let's drop the charades...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: I'm suggesting we cooperate.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Cooperate? What makes you think I'd cooperate with you?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The fact that the famous Robin has chosen my side. Plus, some clues about a traitor, and a bright future for Penacony... Any of that catch your interest?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I find it hard to believe a man who's full of deception.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Fine, you don't have to trust me. What you should trust is...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The sense of justice inside of you.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: ...Show me Robin first.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Alright, as you wish. Here she is...
[The Public Enemy][Firefly]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: What's your trick this time?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Haha, just kidding. I mean, this lady will lead us to Robin, right?
[The Public Enemy][Firefly]: And the Crew too. There are too many people who you owe... an explanation.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Haha, that'd be great. Please follow me, honorable Oak Family Head. Now all the actors... are on the stage.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Moments later
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: This is the monument I mentioned earlier. The names inscribed on it... should be familiar to all of you.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: Razalina and... Tiernan.
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: When Penacony was known as a frontier prison, it was the Trailblazers who connected it with the stars. They were the heroes who saved Asdana, and their names deserve to be immortalized — not just on this small stone tablet, but in the annals of history for all of time.
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: However, today the Planet of Festivities is nothing but sweet dreams. That heavy piece of history is all a distant memory... just like that prison.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: If their names are inscribed here, then that means...
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: According to Micah, they died long ago.
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: Razalina was killed during the War of Independence. She ventured alone into the heart of the star system to investigate the flow of memoria, but she never returned...
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: Tiernan was a skilled gunslinger, strong and reliable. He led the people through countless battles, but he didn't live long enough to witness the arrival of true peace.
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: In the decade following the War, Penacony faced challenges internal and external. To protect Asdana, Tiernan picked up the way of the Trailblaze again, and led the Lampmoth Family to explore beyond the system, only to be surrounded... and wiped out by the Swarm.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Though I had expected as much, the tales of these heroes... truly are sorrowful.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: True to the title of Trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. But... what about this tablet? There are no names carved on it.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: When Dreamflux Reef was created, its owner was still alive. However, he insisted on erecting a monument for himself, saying that "it will happen someday."
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Here we meet again, everyone from the Astral Express.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Robin...
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: Brother...!
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: ...There's no need for words. You're safe, and that's all that matters.
[The Public Enemy][Micah]: Well I did my job — I gathered everyone here. Gallagher will explain the rest to you... Take care.
[The Public Enemy][Misha]: Huh? The atmosphere sure has livened up with all these people in here...
[The Public Enemy][Firefly]: I brought Gallagher here. It's time... to face the "truth."
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: I promised to give the siblings some privacy, so let's talk about our business first. What do you say?
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: That sounds sensible enough. Since you went through the trouble of gathering The Family head, the Crew, and the Stellaron Hunters, I'm guessing you have something important to say, Mr. Gallagher?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Oh, is it that obvious?
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: The look on your face is practically screaming "I'm the one behind all this..."
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Hahaha, you're right, Mr. Yang. It is indeed time to come clean on everything.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The siblings already know what they need to, and they've made their choice. But you Nameless arrived a bit late, so it's only fair that I answer your questions.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Before we begin, let me reintroduce myself. I'm the founder of Dreamflux Reef, the deputy of the Watchmaker, and... the one who sent out that invitation...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: As Gallagher the History Fictionologist, I humbly extend my greetings to you all.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: History Fictionologist? So, what? everything you told us was made up?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Well, don't worry. Almost everything I shared was true... well, except for the part about "The Family accepting me back."
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: I double-checked with Micah, and everything he said about The Family, the Watchmaker, and Mikhail is true.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Thank you for your understanding! Now, let's get down to business. I'm sure you're all wondering why I went through the trouble of setting up this battle for the legacy, inviting different factions, and stirring up a ruckus all over Penacony...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Well, it all boils down to something very familiar to all of you... the Stellaron.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: The Stellaron? But how is that possible? Penacony is a free-flowing interstellar hub. There are no signs of contamination whatsoever.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: You're totally correct. So, care to take a guess at what that means?
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: The Stellaron has been completely sealed?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: I wish that were the truth! But, if that were the case, I wouldn't have invited all of you.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Someone is manipulating the Stellaron?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: How keen! Well, what should I say? I expected nothing less from the person here who is the most familiar with Stellarons.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: You're pulling our leg again!
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The sweet dream doesn't come out of thin air. If you think of the Memory Zone as the sea, creating the land of the dreams is like filling that wild ocean with earth to make an island.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: To achieve this feat, without the help of an Emanator of Remembrance or Enigmata, the only way is to use a Stellaron.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: And that's not something you can achieve with a simple wish. It requires vast quantities of knowledge, time, and manpower. I'm sure you get what I'm hinting at...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: In Asdana, the Planet of Festivities itself is a Stellaron disaster.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: The Planet of Festivities itself... is a Stellaron disaster?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: It all started a long time ago. Back when the Watchmaker and his crew liberated the frontier prison, they faced countless challenges as they began building Penacony from the ground up. That's when the idea of using the Stellaron came into play.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The Stellaron first entered the Asdana system during the war. The Nameless warned everyone against the folly of attempting to tamper with such a power, and most heeded their words. But, there are always people in the shadows with ulterior motives.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The turning point came after Tiernan's death. With two of the Nameless gone, the Watchmaker had to go to the front lines. It was at that moment his rivals saw an opportunity.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: By the time a representative from the Montour system's Family arrived at the Watchmaker's call, the Stellaron had already been activated and was seeping into the primordial Synesthesia Dreamscape.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: And I suppose The Family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the Stellaron?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Not just that! They knew far more about the Stellaron than the average person. They helped Mikhail swiftly quell the civil unrest and played a part in building Penacony, under the disguise of the Harmony.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Those three eras were known as the Age of Dreaming. The Watchmaker, who had been left in the dark, sent out invitations across the universe, spreading the hype around the land of the dreams.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Then... how did they turn against each other?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Remember the island-in-the-ocean metaphor? The truth is, the Stellaron was never truly sealed. It existed in a different form within the Dreamscape. Think about this — what would it cost to create and maintain such a lavish dreamland?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: It's people's lives. The opulent dream is built upon the decay of spirits, with a toxic elixir called "pleasure" flowing through the Dreamscape. It tempts people to indulge in the Dreamscape, and gradually their minds succumb, becoming nourishment for the sweet dream.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Confusion, laziness, and cowardice... weaknesses that plague humanity were magnified and nourished by The Family. Penacony became a new kind of prison, even more impenetrable than the previous one.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Sadly, we realized this far too late. By then, The Family had a firm grip on Penacony, swiftly quelling any opposition that arose.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: At my wit's end, I had to use the power of the Enigmata and sought refuge in this chaotic Memory Zone. Over the years, I fabricated a meme within this dream for our use...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: "Dormancy," that's its real name. We exploited a loophole — you see, regular people can't fall asleep again while they are inside the Dreamscape.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: So, this is the true meaning of "the impossible." You sent out invitations in the Watchmaker's name to find forces capable of resolving the Stellaron disaster and draw them in to Penacony to uncover the truth?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: It's not just that. Above all, I wanted to see what happens when the major factions engage in a struggle for the legacy. Since this is the Watchmaker's first announcement in decades, the traitor within The Family is bound to reveal themselves.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: So, the legacy is just a facade...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: If you want to consider the Stellaron as the legacy, I'm totally fine with that.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: If that's the case, where is the Stellaron now?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: That's a question for Mr. Wings. The Stellaron is still under The Family's control, and as the head of the Oak Family, I'm sure he holds all the answers.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Go ahead. I'm sure Mr. Wings holds all the answers.
[The Public Enemy][Firefly]: As I suspected, the core of this issue lies within... the Stellaron.
[The Public Enemy][Misha]: You all look quite serious... Is there anything I can do to help?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Are you done talking? So, will you tell us where the Stellaron is?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: It... is the Penacony Grand Theater itself.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: As I suspected. It's the embodiment of The Family, the edifice that first materialized within the sweet dream... That's what turned Penacony into its current state.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: As for the person who employed its power... It is in fact Mr. Gopher Wood, the current Dreammaster.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Well, that was easier than I thought. Did you conduct your own investigation already?
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Correct. When I was trying to track down the person who murdered my sister, apart from you... Gopher Wood was my second suspect.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Confronting me first turned out to be a smart move on your part.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I didn't have other options. The Dreammaster has been elusive, and even the heads of the Families can hardly get an audience with him.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Moreover... Mr. Gopher Wood has been kind to my sister and me, and I didn't want it all to end like this.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: What do you mean by that?
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: To be honest, my brother and I are also victims of the Cancer of All Worlds. We grew up as orphans and were adopted by The Family when they came to help. Mr. Gopher Wood recognized our potential and brought us to Penacony.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: But I can't just stand by and watch Mr. Gopher Wood become an enemy of the Harmony. I won't use my voice to support an evil cause...
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: I won't step on that stage and sing, no matter who the traitor is or what orders they give me. I won't let the Charmony Festival become an event that destroys Harmony itself...
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: For the paradise in our dreams.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Indeed... for the paradise in our dreams.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: As the head of the Oak Family, I'm responsible for ensuring Penacony's promising future. Robin and I will head into the sweet dream and confront the Dreammaster, and if it turns out that The Family has truly strayed from the Harmony...
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: I'll fight alongside you. We'll put the Charmony Festival on hold and make sure Mr. Gopher Wood pays for his blood debt.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The enemies you are about to face aren't like this old dog here, who can barely even bark...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Since our interests are aligned, why don't we team up? Maybe, just maybe, we'll have a shot at success.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: We have always been following in the footsteps of our Nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Yeah, we Nameless won't back down from a challenge! Isn't that right, ?
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Ain't nothing to fear no more!
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Ah... that line actually makes me a bit nervous...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Heroes never back down.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Exactly! It's time for the Crew to save the world once more!
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Going up against the Dreammaster? Nah, I'd surrender.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Come on. Don't crack jokes at such a serious moment.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: Rest assured — sitting on the sidelines isn't in our nature. Mr. Sunday, Miss Robin, I'm willing to accompany you on behalf of the Astral Express. Having a third party present should help with negotiations... and could make all the difference if things get ugly.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: Thank you, Mr. Yang.
[The Public Enemy][Robin]: Thank you all very much.
[The Public Enemy][Sunday]: The Charmony Festival is about to start, and time is against us. We must hasten.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: Everyone, let's gather over here — we still need to make some preparations.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: I may have been quick to step up to the plate, but confronting the Dreammaster could be a very dangerous affair.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Huh? Even you're saying that, Mr. Yang? How powerful is that Dreammaster?
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: He's the leader of the Families of Penacony, and he has the entire power of the Harmony behind him... not to mention the Stellaron in his possession. We must proceed with great caution.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Maybe you can just stay behind this time, Mr. Yang...?
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: No, that won't do. Even if we count Robin as an ally, something felt off about Mr. Sunday just now, although I can't quite put my finger on it... I have to make sure he won't turn against us when things start to get dicey.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: You're still carrying the keepsake the IPC envoy gave you, right, ? May I borrow it for a moment?
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: Huh... I knew it.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: What do you need it for?
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: I don't think this'll bring us any luck....
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: As I suspected, this chip Aventurine gave to you... is actually a miniature transmitter.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: If I'm right, he intends to use it to track your location or contact you when needed. As it so happens, this may actually be of some use in the current situation.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Aventurine? Is he still alive...? And what does he have to do with our mission to confront the Dreammaster?
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: Remember what I said earlier? Working with the IPC is a way to keep The Family in check.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: If negotiations go south and The Family show their true colors by going after the Stellaron, I'll use this transmitter to send a message to the IPC. It'll be just the opportunity the IPC Ambassador was hoping for.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: The only question mark in all this is Aventurine's current status... but the IPC is always listening, especially senior Strategic Investment Department heads like him. Getting the message across shouldn't be a problem.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: ...Good luck to you, Welt.
[The Public Enemy][Welt]: Well, you take care too. If anything goes wrong... don't worry about me. Just make sure to seal the Stellaron.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Spoken like a true hero.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Even if the Dreammaster is innocent, The Family's corruption runs deep. I won't make the same mistake Mikhail did. Let's wish him the best of luck...
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Don't you have something else to tell us, Gallagher?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Why would you say so?
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Before we departed, the conductor asked us to inquire about the three Nameless in Penacony. We've already collected intel about Razalina and Tiernan, so the only one left is Legwork.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: If I'm not mistaken... we've already met him somewhere, haven't we?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Hm... it's not enough to say "meet," but the answer is pretty obvious. After all, I've hinted at it in quite an evident way.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: I've been watching over you ever since I received the reply from the Astral Express, and I've seen the great effort you all put into linking different realms together across the cosmos. And now, after getting this far all in one piece, you have truly proven yourselves.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Miss Himeko, were you the one who repaired the Express and got it sailing through the cosmos again?
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Yes.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: And you two young Nameless... you have very interesting life stories and extraordinary skills.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Awww, you're making me blush with these flatteries....Keep them coming'!
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: I don't know much about my life story... but I do have extraordinary skills!
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Ha, of course, my reputation precedes me. Believe in the Galactic Baseballer supremacy!
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: What...? Hey, you can't just make up "titles" like that!
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Heh, you're full of energy. Please send my regards to... the conductor, Pom-Pom. Please let them know that their friend has fond memories from his time aboard the Express, which he reminisces on every time he has a good drink.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: As for the last Nameless... he embarked, disembarked, and embarked again... traveling in a great circle and ending up back where he started.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: On his deathbed, he told me to find the Astral Express and deliver an invitation to the future Nameless. He left behind a special gift, a true "legacy"... something that belongs only to the successors of the Trailblaze.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Come with me. Now... is the time to reveal it.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Back here again...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Sometimes I feel like you're still alive, old friend, like you've still got so much to say and do.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: I've kept my promise... brought the future Trailblazers you've waited so long for. I don't know why you were so obsessed with that train, but I remember your last words...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Don't let us down, old man.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: What's happening!?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Go ahead. His resting place... lies in the garden up ahead.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The first and last Nameless of Penacony...
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Mikhail Char Legwork, the Watchmaker.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Beneath the sea surface of Memory Zone, in a garden closest to the full moon in the water, an elderly man rests on a recliner, enveloped in utter silence.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: The Watchmaker, Mikhail Char Legwork, has passed into that endless, timeless dream, where no sound could ever awaken him.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Sure enough... the Watchmaker is the third Nameless. Even I could guess that one.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: The legacy he left behind was a dream bubble. I believe inside that bubble, there's something that holds meaning only for the Nameless.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: After all, when I checked its contents, I found nothing inside ... Maybe some Trailblaze runes? Even more enigmatic than me.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Well, let's have a look.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: As the words cease, Himeko nods ever so slightly in your direction. You take a deep breath, steady your mind, and turn your gaze towards the Watchmaker...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Touch the dream bubble in Mikhail's hand.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: You press your hands against the dream bubble and the thick viscous memoria converges under strain, then stretches outward from your fingertips. As if weaving a delicate web, it gently cradles your palm.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: A chill travels from your fingertips, carrying with it a myriad of vibrant and intertwined memories, as experience would suggest...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: But this time, you see nothing at all.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: How could this be?
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Try to focus and capture memories...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Take a deep breath and try to read the dream bubble again...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: The dream bubble is clearly extraordinary. Perhaps the approach was wrong, you think, holding your breath and closing your eyes. With one knee on the ground, you press your forehead against the thin film coated in memoria.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Yet, before you, there remains an abyss of darkness. No crimson sun descending upon snow-capped mountains, no gentle laughter, no twinkling stars, no echoes of swords clashing, and most of all, no traces of "trailblaze"...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: ...There is nothing and nothing is there. Indubitably, this is but an empty dream bubble.
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Wait, what's going on...?
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: Seriously... there's nothing inside this dream bubble?
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: ...
[The Public Enemy][March 7th]: How could a dream bubble be empty?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Hmph, just as I suspected.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: That old man always had this strange belief in the Nameless and the Trailblaze, and I never understood where he got that confidence from... especially since he never managed to get in touch with the Express while he was alive.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: I could never figure out what was going on in that old man's head, but this empty dream bubble is so typical of him. He was always full of weird fantasies... and incomprehensible romanticism.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: That mischievous old man... Well, I didn't expect him to leave anything concrete behind anyway.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: ...
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Don't think that's the case, Gallagher. I'm sure Mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Heh, don't start getting all philosophical on me, alright?
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Just as Mikhail believes in the Nameless of the future, we unconditionally believe in the Nameless of the past. How could they leave with regrets for the future when they were ready to dedicate their lives to the land they loved?
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: There must be something contained in this dream bubble. It's just we haven't figured it out yet. You also have faith in the Watchmaker, don't you, Gallagher?
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: Well, I'm a follower of the Enigmata. My philosophy forbids me to have faith in anything.
[The Public Enemy][Gallagher]: ...That's why I understand what "faith" means in the Path of Trailblaze, and I also want to know what he left behind. Heh, I'll leave it to you guys then.
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: Can I borrow your pet? I need to make a trip back to Golden Hour and check something at the Dreamscape Sales Store...
[The Public Enemy][Himeko]: It's for Mikhail, and for the future of Penacony.
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Switching to Boothill's POV...
[The Public Enemy][Narration]: Boothill comes to an agreement with Dan Heng. They will now try to infiltrate the sweet dream and save their friends...

[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: Welcome to the Reverie Hotel. How may I help you?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Greetings. We're the Nameless from the Astral Express, and we'd like to check in.
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: The Astral Express? But I thought...
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Yes, my companions already checked in. My name is Dan Heng, and I believe my personal information is recorded in your system.
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: I see, but your companions said you wouldn't be coming due to a change of plans.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Hah! Now the plans have changed again!
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: And you are...?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Me? I'm Pom-Pom, a new Nameless who's also with the Astral Express.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: ...He's my fellow Trailblazer. We responded to The Family's invitation before he boarded the Express, so he wasn't registered in your system. Is it possible to accommodate him as well?
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: Oh, I see! Another one of the Nameless had a similar situation. Seems like a lot of people are joining the Trailblaze these days.
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: Since there is a precedent, it shouldn't be a problem. Just give me a second to contact your companions...
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: ...
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: ...I'm sorry, dear guests, but it seems I'm unable to reach the other members of the Astral Express.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: What do you mean by "unable to reach" them?
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: My apologies. This is the first time I've encountered a situation like this. However, the system indicates that those guests are still in the Dreamscape.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: ...How about this? Give me their room number, and we'll go check on them ourselves.
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: I'm afraid that's not possible. I need to verify both of your identities before I can share any guest information.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: How about you just wake up someone? Let's say... Welt?
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: I'm sorry, but there are strict rules regarding forced awakening — it cannot be done without the proper clearance.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: So nothing works, huh? What's your solution then? Are you saying we sleep here, at the reception?
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: Please be patient. We need to contact your companions in order to confirm your identities...
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: And now it seems you need to confirm our identities before you can contact our companions.
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: It seems so.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Fudge! Look, nothin' personal, but if you can't handle this, go find someone else who can, okay?
[Bullet & Brain][Alley]: Please calm down, dear guests! I do recall that Mr. Sunday, the Oak Family Head, personally handled this issue earlier. Please wait a moment while I contact him.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: I don't think she's trying to give us a hard time. She really just doesn't know what to do.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: I have a bad feeling about this. You tried to contact them on the Express earlier, but they didn't respond.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: ...
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Something doesn't seem right. I need to leave for a moment. You can stay here with the receptionist.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Sure thing — just don't keep me waiting forever.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: 
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: 
[Bullet & Brain][Coty]: Greetings, I'm Coty of the Bloodhound Family, Head of Security for the hotel. How may I assist you?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Hello! So, there's something I wanted to ask about... I've been hearing some unsettling rumors about certain incidents that might affect the Charmony Festival...
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Do you think there's anything to be worried about? I've traveled all the way from the Hyai'i Federation, and I don't want my trip to be ruined!
[Bullet & Brain][Coty]: Umm... what do you mean?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Wait, you haven't heard?
[Bullet & Brain][Coty]: I'm not sure where you heard those rumors, but they're completely baseless. I can assure you, as a representative of the Bloodhound Family, that everything is going smoothly for the Charmony Festival.
[Bullet & Brain][Coty]: At present, all the Families are focused on making sure the festival starts on time. Even the Dreammaster himself has arrived. So don't worry. Your trip won't be in vain.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Ah, that's a relief to hear.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: 
[Bullet & Brain][Coty]: Please be patient as you await the festival. The Family will spare no effort to ensure your satisfaction.
[Bullet & Brain][Jno]: The Charmony Festival is about to start! I'm so excited!
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Hey, are you guys here for the Charmony Festival too?
[Bullet & Brain][Jno]: Well, I didn't come all the way here specially for the festival. Honestly, I don't really even know what it's about, but I heard it's a lot of fun.
[Bullet & Brain][Sabrina]: Well, back in my homeworld, Anaria, we have festivals like that all the time. My dad threw me a birthday party one time that was just as extravagant as the Charmony Festival.
[Bullet & Brain][Jno]: Oh, come on! The Charmony Festival is a once-in-an-Amber-Era event. How can a birthday party compare?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Well, you never know, right? Maybe on her world birthdays only happen once an Amber Era?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Anyway, let's forget about that. Have you heard about the... uh, unsettling things happening in the Dreamscape?
[Bullet & Brain][Jno]: Unsettling things? What could possibly go wrong? It better not ruin the Charmony Festival. I've been looking forward to it!
[Bullet & Brain][Sabrina]: Relax, with a big event like this, there's bound to be lots of gossip and rumors. Don't worry. If anything does happen, The Family will be on top of it.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Oh! That's a relief! I didn't come all this way to see the festival go down the drain!
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: 
[Bullet & Brain][Sabrina]: Surely there'll be a lot of celebrities at the Charmony Festival. It's a great opportunity to make some valuable connections.
[Bullet & Brain][Jno]: Don't enter the dream with such a utilitarian agenda!
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Back already?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Hasn't she returned yet?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Nope. I'm starting to wonder if sending her to contact Sunday was a good idea.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Neither the staff nor the guests seem to know anything about what's happening in the Dreamscape, and wherever we go, all we see is people enjoying themselves... Definitely not a good sign.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: I agree. Another unusual thing is that the Oak Family is supposed to be in charge of organizing the council and managing everything inside and outside the Dreamscape. However...
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: I walked around the hotel but didn't meet a single member of the Oak Family on such an important day.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Well I'll be forked... if I remember correctly, the head of the Oak Family is that Sunday guy, right?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: We shouldn't linger here too long. Let's go back to the Express for now.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Not so fast. Have you ever robbed the IPC, bro? If you run away now, everyone will be chasing after you.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Are you suggesting we sit here and do nothing?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: I wouldn't say "do nothing," but let's stay put for now. Even if The Family has ulterior motives, they couldn't have anticipated us showing up here. We're the surprise factor for them.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: They don't want to attract unwanted attention from certain outsiders, so they won't do anything reckless... See? The IPC lackeys are keeping a close eye on this hotel.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: ...If I were a Family member, I'd find an official excuse and keep the surprise factors here. If we just wait here, that would be like walking into their trap.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Of course, we don't need to walk into their trap. I gave a backup plan to the Memokeeper. If it turns out we won't be allowed to enter the Dreamscape, she'll order a drink for me in the VIP Lounge at the hotel in reality.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: A secret signal?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: That's right.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: A concrete object can indeed help the Memokeeper establish a connection with you... but Boothill, if you have more back-up plans in the future, I hope you'll let me know in advance.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: I'm sorry, but it's one of my quirks. I have too many unreliable friends, and if I reveal that I have backup plans, things can... things can go awry. And that would leave all backup plans completely useless.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: How do we get into the VIP lounge?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: This is where my street smarts come into play.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: You're the lobby manager, right?
[Bullet & Brain][Dennis]: Yes, I am. How may I assist you?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: We're the Nameless from the Astral Express! We wanted to check in, but there's something wrong with your system! The lady at the front desk said she would contact the manager, but now she's nowhere to be found!
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: We've been waitin' here forever, without any food or water! What the fork, man? Is this how The Family treats its guests?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Is this your idea of "street smarts"? Starting an altercation?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: It's called "standing up for your rights."
[Bullet & Brain][Dennis]: I apologize for the inconvenience. Please wait while we try to contact Mr. Sunday. I'll arrange two premium seats in the VIP Lounge, so you can rest there while you wait.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: See? Just like that.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Just... just don't call yourself a Nameless next time.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Wow! This bar is something else — certainly worthy of the Planet of Festivities.
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: Good evening, gentlemen.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Hey... I have an order for a bottle of Asdana's White Oak. Can you help us find it?
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: Asdana's White Oak? I think there might be a misunderstanding. We don't serve that here.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: No way. Are you sure you're not mistaken?
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: If someone had reserved such a beverage, I would definitely remember it. It sells for hundreds of thousands of credits per bottle, after all... I couldn't afford to cover for such an item if it were broken or lost.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: That's strange... could it be that the Memokeeper couldn't afford it?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Then what should we do now?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: No need to rush. Let's grab some drinks first. Maybe I arrived too early and she hasn't come yet.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Let's see what kind of juice malts you all have here... Well, give me a glass of Hinnom Valley 40 Years. I'll have it neat, no ice.
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: Well, that's the most expensive one on the list. You have a taste for the finer things.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Hah, it's on the house anyway...
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: What can I get for you?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Anything you recommend is fine.
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: Then I would recommend today's special, Glass Village — it's Classic SoulGlad mixed with Leboom juice. It's refreshing and suits your cool demeanor. Just one minute.
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: Soon, Anderson brings two cups of wine...
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Ahh! This flavor... Dynamite Barbecue with Rocket Fuel... It really hits the spot! Truly the finest sherry cask-aged malt juice in the cosmos.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: "Dynamite Barbecue with Rocket Fuel"... Is that really something that humans enjoy?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Hey, this guy doesn't know anything at all.
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: As long as you are satisfied, dear guests. Please enjoy.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Let's give the Memokeeper another half system hour. If she doesn't show up, we'll need to come up with a new plan. In the meantime, let's take stock of the situation. What do you think?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: The situation is unclear. Something must have happened on the Planet of Festivities, but the public is unaware of it. Someone in a position of power within The Family must be covering it up.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: It's unusual for the followers of the Harmony to invite other factions, let alone the IPC and the Masked Fools... If what you said about the Emanator of the Nihility is true, the situation in Penacony is... a little complicated, to say the least.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Actually, there's something else I'm concerned about — regarding Acheron.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: As you know, the faction that follows the Path of The Hunt are some of the most dangerous folks in the Cosmos to mess with. I mean, who in their right mind would impersonate the Xianzhou Alliance or the Galaxy Rangers? It's like asking for a death wish...
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Isn't there a saying among the Xianzhou people that "the Reignbow sect lets their Lux Arrow do all the beating..."
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Talking. Do all the talking.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Well, you know what I mean. Even though the Galaxy Rangers have been out of sight for years, we've been keeping an eye on this region. Even the dumbest criminals know better than to mess with the Annihilation Gang, much less the Rangers.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: But that Acheron lady... she doesn't seem like a lunatic at all. On the contrary, she's highly logical and organized. She knows exactly when to hold back and when to strike without mercy.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: And you believe that someone like her would have an ulterior motive for impersonating a Galaxy Ranger?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have my suspicions. Maybe she knows a Galaxy Ranger, or perhaps she's trying to lure us out for some reason... which I can't figure out.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Anyway, what worries me more are the anomalies within the Family. They've summoned followers from various paths for the festival. No matter how generous The Family might be, this move seems highly unusual.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Unless the invitations weren't sent by them. If that's the case, it's even more intriguing that The Family insists on organizing the Charmony Festival... despite the chaos.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Maybe it's Xipe the Harmony pulling the strings. You find it beyond human understanding because it wasn't arranged by humans at all.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: People do stupid things out of irrational impulses. They abandon their principles when self-interest is involved. They believe in things they know they shouldn't, and fudge— they even break their own rules!
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: But Aeons don't. THEY stick to their determined path and never turn back, even if THEY reach a dead end!
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: You think Xipe's will is behind all this?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: It may not necessarily be Xipe, but there's definitely some higher entity involved. I know it may sound pessimistic, but if human free will were reliable, why would we even need Galaxy Rangers?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: It's much simpler when you boil it down to the Aeons and Paths, like how Lan always follows the Path of The Hunt or how the Express stays true to the Trailblaze despite Akivili's disappearance.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: But in my opinion, Akivili's fall holds significance for the Nameless.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Oh? So you're saying the Nameless now have to take responsibility for their own choices because their "absolutely right" leader is gone?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Exactly. I believe the purpose of the journey isn't just about following a path that's always considered "absolutely right"...
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: It's more about doing your best to choose the "right path" for yourself among countless possibilities, even with limited insight and judgment.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: I don't know what you've been through, but I agree that people must take responsibility for their choices, because no one else can do it for them.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: That's why the Galaxy Rangers need to uncover the impostor... and figure out her true intentions.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Just in case, I have a backup plan if the Memokeeper doesn't show up... this is my final backup plan, I promise.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: You sure have a lot of cards up your sleeve.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Well, going back to my old career would make things a lot easier.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: By the way, when you were walking around the hotel, did you happen to see any... important-looking guests?
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: ...What's your plan?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: It's simple. We just grab some hostages and use them as bargaining chips with The Family. Or maybe we can even take their identities...
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: No need for that. We'll return to the Express now.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Wait! Are you getting scared? Draw your weapon! Let's make a big scene!
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: Are you leaving, esteemed guests? Would you like to cancel that Asdana's White Oak you just ordered?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: ...Huh? Asdana's White Oak? But didn't you just say...
[Bullet & Brain][Anderson]: Looks like you are a bit intoxicated, esteemed guests. You ordered a bottle of Asdana's White Oak just a moment ago.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: Looks like... your Memokeeper friend has finally arrived.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: ...Oh, right! Sorry, my memory's not the best. You know, too many modifications and all. Anyway, let me check... Well fork me... It's Asdana's White Oak alright, and there's a note...
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: ..."I'll be waiting for you on the Astral Express."
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: No mistake, that's her message to you. She knew the hotel wasn't safe, so she suggested we find another place.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Well, looks like we took a detour, but now it's back to the Astral Express. So, what are we waiting for? Let's go!
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: Pom-Pom: You're back? Two guests just boarded, saying they were looking for Boothill, so I told them to wait in the Parlor Car.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Oh! Just in time!
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: ...Two guests?
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: Pom-Pom: She's one of them. Look, we welcome all passengers on the Astral Express, but sneaking in like that... You have no regard for etiquette!
[Bullet & Brain][Black Swan]: My apologies, conductor. It was an oversight on my part. I assumed you were already acquainted with the Garden... Given the chaotic situation in Penacony, the Nameless are the only ones we can truly trust right now.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: You are the Memokeeper?
[Bullet & Brain][Black Swan]: Pleased to meet you, Dan Heng. I've seen you in others' memories. And as for Boothill... This is our first face-to-face meeting. I hope you enjoyed that bottle of Asdana's White Oak. You sure have a refined taste.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Finally, Memokeeper! Well, let's cut to the chase. Spill everything you know.
[Bullet & Brain][Black Swan]: That's precisely what I intend to do. But before that, please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Black Swan, and I serve the Garden of Recollection as a Memokeeper. As for Acheron's story...
[Bullet & Brain][Black Swan]: I'm sure she knows it better than I do.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Greetings. I'm Acheron.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: What!? You Garden of Recollection shirtbag, you betrayed me!?
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: I apologize, but she did that at my request. Due to certain... reasons, I have been exiled by The Family. Thankfully, this Memokeeper came to my aid and helped me escape their surveillance unnoticed.
[Bullet & Brain][Black Swan]: To be honest, it was more like stalking than helping, and the process was far from "unnoticed"... But we did escape.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: I asked her to guide me to a place beyond The Family's reach and to contact a few trustworthy individuals, namely all of you.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: Trustworthy? Ha... hahahahaha! Son of a nice lady! You think I'm dumb or something?
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: How about this? I'll put a few bullet holes in your head and see what secrets spill out, then we can talk about "trust"...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: It doesn't have to be like that. I'm willing to answer all your questions, but not right now... If my cover hadn't been blown, we might have had more time, but at the moment, we don't have any other options.
[Bullet & Brain][Boothill]: No other options? What do you mean?
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: This is the only way I can ensure everyone's safety...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: I kindly request an immediate warp jump out of the Asdana star system.
[Bullet & Brain][Dan Heng]: ...
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: Pom-Pom: This passenger is requesting...
[Bullet & Brain][Black Swan]: As far as I can tell, she's not a threat and seems to be telling the truth.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: I've briefly traveled with your companions and know their whereabouts, Dan Heng. Please rest assured, your Nameless companions are safe, but they need our help.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: As for Boothill, as you may have guessed... I've been waiting for you. Galaxy Rangers are known for their elusive nature and limited contact with each other, so this is the only way I could "reach out" to you.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Only by doing this can I find a true Galaxy Ranger and fulfill a long-standing promise...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: ...To return "his" relics to their rightful owner.
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: ...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Someone once told me... that every rainfall is like a gift from the heavens, a sign of their mercy upon the world.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Raindrops are said to be the tears of the Gods, shed in response to the sorrows of the world. Their constant pouring is a reminder that the Gods haven't abandoned us yet.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: So...
[Bullet & Brain][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Bullet & Brain.mp4
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: How long has this rain been going on for?
[Bullet & Brain][???]: I used to believe, just like you, that it would eventually stop. Years and decades passed... and in the end, such hope faded away before the rain did.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Looks like the God you mentioned doesn't exist after all.
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: As he spoke, the old man's gaze remained fixed on the distance. Amidst the fine drizzle of black rain, countless shadowy hands emerged from the sea, shrouded in an ethereal mist, reaching out towards the sky one by one.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Well, let me share a story with you...
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Mortals who walk the Paths are like sailors on a vast ocean, leaving behind a trail that creates countless ripples of possibilities. These ripples last longer than the fleeting lifetimes of humans.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: And for some, their presence leaves such a strong mark that it's reflected in the waves.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Like... those shadows on the ocean.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Sin Thirsters... the obsessions of the Pathstriders. They emerge from the depths of IX, seeing themselves as masters of their own destiny, unknowingly repeating the actions of their past lives.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: They emerge from the Nihility and head toward it, leading purposeless lives. However, these hollow phantoms...
[Bullet & Brain][???]: ...They were once my dear companions, a group of Galaxy Rangers.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Are you watching over them?
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Watching over them? No, I'm guiding them toward transcendence.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: It was a brutal war, a crusade that shook the universe. The universe witnessed the fall of Zulo the Lord Ravager, but it came at a price... A price so hefty that only those who were there still remember.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: The unwavering determination of The Hunt followers persists even in death, so someone must guide these lost souls to their life beyond. They were heroes in their time, and they shouldn't be reduced to mere puppets of the Nihility.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: As for me... I've suffered too many losses on that battlefield to advance any further, and that makes me the most fitting person to carry out this task.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: But you know, these Sin Thirsters... They are not who they used to be.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Does this seem pointless to you?
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Well, some tasks have to be done, even if they are pointless.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: ...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: I can help you.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: For what?
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: For the meaning of the Nihility... that's what I've been seeking.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: ...I see. After all, this realm is off-limits to ordinary souls, right?
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Thank you, stranger. I wish that you find what you seek.
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: Before we part ways, I have one more question...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: It is true that their actions and even their entire lives may seem pointless from our perspective, but if, and it's just an "if"...
[Bullet & Brain][Acheron]: If this is what the departed ones expected, should we try to change it?
[Bullet & Brain][???]: A good question, and a profound one... I don't know the answer.
[Bullet & Brain][???]: What I do know is that one day, I too will pass away. I hope that when that day comes...
[Bullet & Brain][???]: Someone will stand at my grave and place a bouquet of flowers.
[Bullet & Brain][Narration]: Switching to Robin's POV...

[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: I humbly request your blessings, esteemed advocate of Xipe.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Come to me, my Kinship. I have sought THEIR presence with us.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: As you wish.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: I have faithfully served the Alfalfa Family for nearly a decade, promoting the Path of the Harmony to the best of my ability. However, I made a mistake yesterday. While I was preparing dinner for The Family Head, I accidentally dropped a prepared dish on the floor.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: Out of laziness, I lied and claimed that everything was ready. Although the Head has dismissed me as punishment, it has been tough to sleep with the guilt still gnawing at me, as I worried that the seeds of evilness may have taken root in my soul. So, I confess to you now to seek atonement for my sins.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Do you sincerely repent and vow to change your ways?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: Yes.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Have you examined your soul and confessed all your sins?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: Yes.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Are you willing to accept the process of atonement?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: Yes.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Very well. Show your dedication and goodwill to The Family, and you shall be reinstated among them. Now, please leave in peace.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Halovian Servant]: Praise Xipe. And thank you, esteemed advocate.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Narration]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...Next. Please step forward.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Panicked Dreamchaser]: I... I wholeheartedly confess to you... Please, pardon my sins!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Rest assured. I have implored THEIR presence to be with us. As long as you are sincere, absolution will be granted.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Panicked Dreamchaser]: Oh! Oh, great... you know, I... I arrived in Penacony as a stowaway. I sold everything to get a ticket... my house, my land... and... my two children...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: I see... Please go on.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Panicked Dreamchaser]: My children were starving, and I hoped they'd have a chance at survival if they became slaves here. If... if I can strike it rich here, I'll lift them out of that situation... and give them the life they deserve...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Panicked Dreamchaser]: But, but, the Bloodhound Family got wind of it. They're on my tail... hunting me down... I thought I could bring my kids here! It was all my fault... all my fault...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: The Family is ready to forgive all sinners. I'll ask the Bloodhound Family to cease their pursuit. You don't need to live in fear anymore.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Panicked Dreamchaser]: Thank you, thank you! I'll work my hardest to redeem my children and make them part of The Family... P—Praise the Harmony!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Narration]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...Next. Please step forward.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: Hey, long time no see, Mr. Sunday! The most esteemed individual in Penacony and... the next leader of the Oak Family, right?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...I have sought THEIR presence with us. Let us proceed.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: Sure, let's just get this over with. Ahem! I have sinned. Please forgive me! I wasted half a pizza at breakfast... and a bottle of SoulGlad.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: That's it. Nothing more. Can we wrap this up? I've got a Roboball game to catch, you know?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Do you... seek to atone for your sins through good deeds?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: My "sins"!? Starting to sound like a saint, eh? Let me tell you something — Neither The Family nor you have the right to judge me.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: You think nobody knows what your precious Family has done? About the Watchmaker, huh? Don't kid yourself, feather-brain. Those Dreamchasers might be fooled by your act, but don't fool yourself.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: Before you start spouting off your holy verses, answer me this... Where does the power of the Oak Family come from? And your power? What makes you think you can sit there, all high and mighty, looking down on everyone else?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Pepeshi Merchant]: Well, I've spent enough time in confession today to enter the Harmony's paradise, right? Then I'll take my leave. Good luck with your election, and... don't make me regret my investments in you.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Narration]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: O, revered Triple-Faced Soul, hear my doubts...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Who can judge the strong when their power hides their crimes?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Who can vouch for the weak when they will pay any price to survive?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Who can comfort the purest souls when even they get led astray?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: If "the strong defending the weak" is truly the foundation of paradise...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...then who— who is responsible for the suffering and anguish in this wretched world?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Narration]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Brother... Brother...?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...Brother? Are you alright?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...I'm fine. I've been working long hours, and I just made a trip to Dreamflux Reef and back... So I'm a bit out of sorts. But it'll all be over before we know it.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Welt]: You've been working non-stop on the Charmony Festival, Mr. Sunday, and no one could have predicted this incident. Even if the Stellaron does pose a grave threat, I still feel sorry for all the trouble we've caused you.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Hehe, no need to worry about troubling anyone. The Charmony Festival was meant to spread joy and harmony across the Cosmos. But now that we know the truth, I'm afraid we'll have to cancel it.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: It has always been our wish to make everyone happy, so... we'll do our best to explain everything to the Dreammaster. I'm sure he'll understand.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Even if the negotiation does not go smoothly... I'll refuse to go on stage. Without the Chordmaster, the Harmonious Choir would not arrive, and the Charmony Festival would be just a grand performance, and nothing more.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Welt]: I'm relieved to see your determination.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Welt]: Y'know, since arriving in Penacony, we haven't had any contact with this Dreammaster himself. I'd heard of the heads of the five major lineages, but the Dreammaster is a mystery to me.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: The Dreammaster rarely grants an audience — even for us. But given the urgency of the situation, he's agreed to meet us in person.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Perhaps you'll be the first guest to meet the Dreammaster in years, Mr. Yang.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Welt]: Let's hope we can reach a consensus that satisfies everyone.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Indeed — let us hope so.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: It's about time. We'll have to get ready for the meeting... I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the urgency.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Welt]: Don't worry. I'll be waiting here.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: Oh, dear... it's Mr. Sunday! Hey, come over here! Hahaha...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Looks like someone needs help... let's go check it out.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Welt]: Thank you for everything you've done. I'll be waiting here.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: Oh, Mr. Sunday... Hey there! Okay, see the moon in the sky? It's about the size of the cap on my SoulGlad bottle!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: If I just reached out my hand... I could grab the moon, couldn't I?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: The moon... You mean the Grand Theater?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: Oh, yeah! Haha, look at me! I've been away from home for too long... I must be missing that moon... *hiccup*
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: But... it's no big deal! The Grand Theater here looks much better than the moon back home... It's just... magnificent!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: They told me not to sell everything I had just to come to Penacony... Tsk, how short-sighted!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Selling everything you had? Why would you go to such lengths?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: Why? Can't you see...? Life back home is miserable... It's not really living at all.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: It's better to be here in Penacony! No pain, no worries about tomorrow, just sweet dreams! You can do whatever you want! That's what I call living... *hiccup* Yeah, now this is the life!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Is this... truly "living"...?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: *hiccup* Huh...? What did you just say, young lady...? I didn't quite catch that...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Oh, it's nothing, sir. You see, the traffic on Glaux Avenue can be dangerous. How about I ask a Bloodhound Family member to escort you to Aideen Park over there so you can continue enjoying your sweet dream?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: Oh... yeah, that's a great idea! Wow, no wonder you're the leader of this sweet dream! You're totally a lifesaver!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Drunken Guest]: See you around, Mr. Sunday! And... It was nice chatting with you... *hiccup*
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: What's up, sister?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: This is the land of the dreams, but why do they live like this?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: The man we ran into... he doesn't seem happy at all.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Even though sweet dreams are nice, they're just illusions. But for him, they're the only way to survive, even if it means giving up on reality... That's not really living at all.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: I suppose you have a point... but in my opinion, that's how most people live their lives.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...Why do you say that?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: You think that man is not actually "living," but that's not quite accurate. Even without Penacony, people create their own illusions called "self-value."
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: People believe they have a predetermined value to fulfill. Gaining value means gaining power, and those deemed worthless are seen as the weak.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: However, value doesn't come out of thin air, and there's a limit to it. To accumulate value, people have to take from others. So, the weak get exploited and oppressed...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Are you suggesting that... this is not how things should be?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Exactly, but ironically, people don't think there's anything wrong with it, because they uphold the illusory notion of self-value, and even the weak believe in it.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Survival of the fittest... that's where all the tragedies in the world come from. People come to the sweet dream in Penacony to escape from that reality and find solace.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: No tragedies exist here, only happiness, although in its nascent form. Isn't that the same paradise we yearn for in our dreams?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Perhaps that man is just an exception. Let's not jump to conclusions. We should experience the Dreamscape ourselves, just as I did at Dreamflux Reef.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Yes, seeing is believing. I'll accompany you. The Dreammaster hasn't shown up yet, so we have some time for a stroll.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: Glad to meet you again, Robin! How are the preparations for the Charmony Festival coming along? We're all so excited about it!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: It's going smoothly. Thanks for making the trip to join the Festival.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: You're too kind, Robin. It's a pleasure to have guests from all over the universe celebrating day and night!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: I can't stand being lonely or bored, so this jubilant Dreamscape is perfect for me.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: But if this went on forever... would it get boring too?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: Nah, not at all! Who would get tired of having so much fun?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: Every day, you get to wear fancy clothes, explore all sorts of dream bubbles, indulge in delicious food without gaining weight, and you never get old or sick... As long as you can afford a room, this place is the ultimate paradise!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: But... you know that only a few things can be brought back from the Dreamscape to reality, right?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: That's exactly why I don't plan on bringing anything back! Just enjoying the dream itself is good enough for me! I mean, I'm not one of those long-living species. I only have around sixty or seventy years in this lifetime, and there's so much to worry about... Being happy here is pure bliss.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: Only in this sweet dream can I truly feel like I'm in control of my life and fate... Who would want to go back to reality after experiencing this bliss?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...I see. I genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Cheerful Guest]: And I wish you a fantastic performance, Robin! I'm off to the Blue Hour for the ball. See you later!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: *sigh*
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Seems like that guest's perspective didn't resonate with you either.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: She had a valid point, and I could sense her genuine happiness. It's just that...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: What you're trying to say is... she thinks she's in control of her life, but in reality, she's just escaping from reality and seeking solace in this sweet dream. Once she steps out of this sanctuary, everything will be lost.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Well, she did make mention of being able to "afford a room"... didn't she?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: However, the paradise in our dreams... it doesn't have to end.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: No, and the paradise we yearn for... shouldn't be just a fleeting dream either.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: The scenery in this Dreamscape is truly breathtaking, isn't it?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: Oh, Robin? Can't believe I'm meeting you in person here... What an honor.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: You're right. Even though time stands still in this Dreamscape, it always feels fresh... I find something new every time.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: A philosophical mind... I hope I'm not intruding.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: Not at all. With little time left, I yearn for meaningful conversations, especially with someone as esteemed as you. Do you mind if we chat?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: It's my pleasure. No need to be formal — just speak your mind. You said "with little time left"... Please forgive me for being blunt, but is that why you came to Penacony?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: Hehe, yeah... I was part of a war, and while escaping from the Sukhousian mothership, I got exposed to some radioactive materials.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: And then? All my comrades died, and my hometown was wiped out by neutron bombardments. I couldn't bear to live with everything I knew gone... That's when I heard about a possible solution here, so I came.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: How heart-wrenching... I hope The Family has been able to help you.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: They have, and I'm truly grateful for that. They provided me with a comfortable room, the most advanced life-support devices in the Cosmos, and a stellar team of caregivers.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: My physical body is now in the Dreampool, sustained by life support. The me you see here is whole, rational, and no different from any other person... but I can't say the same for the "me" in the hotel room.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: My true appearance... Well, I hope you never have to witness it, Robin.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: So... you'll be living forever in this Dreamscape, right?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: Heh, just being able to live at all is good enough for me. Whether it's in this Dreamscape or not, well, I don't really have much say in the matter.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: My world has been torn apart, and my life could end any second. So... even if this whole place is an illusion, it's still my paradise, and I'll treasure every moment I spend here.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Quiet Guest]: Heh... how I envy those everlasting things...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: That old man's story... it's so tragic. Fortunately, this sweet dream gives him joyful memories to hold onto for the rest of his life.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: That's precisely why this sweet dream in Penacony exists.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: However, even the sweet dream has its limitations. While it provides solace to the disillusioned, it can't completely eliminate pain in reality.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: There will be a way out. Penacony is already on the right track.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][???]: Look who we have here? A lovely young lady.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Wait, is that... me?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][???]: Brother! What a surprise to see you again.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Show yourself. Your trick won't work on us.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: I've heard that a skilled Masked Fool received an invitation too... That must be you, right? Did you enjoy yourself?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: Barely. The people here are way too gullible. A little bait is all it takes for them to bite, and they run away at the slightest hint of danger. In other words, they're naive and cowardly!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Now that you've had your fill, it'd be wise to leave before it's too late. The music of the Harmony doesn't tolerate discord.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: What? Now that you have the real Robin, I'm useless? Oh, how disheartening! I've done so much for The Family.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: You should be thanking me because if it weren't for me cleaning up this mess... Penacony would still be in shambles. Don't you think?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: That was a personal request from the head of the Iris Family, and it has nothing to do with us. Step aside and stop causing trouble for the Charmony Festival.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: The Charmony Festival? Heh, you think you can scare me? You think I've no idea what you're planning?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: I don't care what you're thinking, chicken wing boy, but I'm pretty sure our lovely Robin won't be appearing on stage. After all, you're well aware of what a sorry state this Dreamscape is in under the banner of Harmony...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: Penacony, the Land of the Dreams... is this truly the paradise you desire?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...Stop it!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: What's the rush, chicken wing boy? Did I get to you?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Our paradise is none of your concern, Masked Fool. Leave now, or The Family won't tolerate you anymore.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: Alright, alright. I'll go, but Robin, I suggest you seriously consider this...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: ...Do you really believe those living in dreams can escape pain and find true happiness?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: Well, I've done my part, and now I'm simply waiting for the fireworks to begin.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: Here, the last two gifts for both of you, and don't lose them. If, by some unfortunate chance, the Charmony Festival starts against all odds... remember to use them during the show.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sparkle]: And it'll be thrilling! Bang!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: I heard a raven cawing in the distance... It seems the Dreammaster will arrive soon.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Let's wait here for the Dreammaster to arrive.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Okay. By the way, brother, I heard you no longer have a sweet tooth. Back when we were kids, you used to steal my desserts...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Seems like a lot has changed during my absence. What exactly happened?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Well, someone has to stay awake even in this sweet dream.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: But that "someone" doesn't have to be you or anyone in particular. You're carrying too much on your shoulders, brother.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: The paradise in our dreams... it shouldn't be like this.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Penacony is nothing more than a dream. It can't erase the worries and pain of reality or bring true happiness... It only offers an escape from reality. Nothing more.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Remember the old man we met earlier? Without this dream, he might have completely lost himself.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: That might be true, but... even without Penacony, he could have chosen another path. As far as I know, the Intelligentsia Guild has been promoting their rehabilitation techniques for a long time now.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: That path may have been more ordinary and challenging, but now he's in a comatose state, and the "sweet dream" has become a sort of end-of-life care. His fate... is sealed.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Is Penacony granting these people a future, or is it taking it away from them?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Well, don't forget this... not everyone really has a future.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: The future for humanity is like the sky for birds. People mistakenly believe that flight is inherent to birds because they've never witnessed those birds crashing to their death.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Do you remember how we took in that little Charmony Dove when we were young?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Yeah, we took care of it — provided food and water, and groomed its feathers. And later... when I decided to leave Penacony, I opened the cage and set it free.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Well, I didn't mention what happened to it in my letters, because I didn't want to upset you.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Shortly after you left, it crashed to its death right in front of your window.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: ...I had surmised as much. I knew you wouldn't have avoided mentioning the bird for no reason.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Despite that unfortunate outcome, I still believe it was the right decision. Birds aren't meant to spend their lives in cages... They belong in the sky, even if they can't fly.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: But here's the thing. If there are birds in this world that can never fly, can we really assert that they belong in the sky?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: Are you implying... that the same goes for humans too?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Let's take the Astral Express as an example. The Nameless made tremendous efforts to bridge worlds, gaining fame across the universe... However, only a few extraordinary individuals can endure such a perilous journey.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: That's because the pursuit of the Trailblaze exceeds the capabilities of ordinary humans. Otherwise, why would this Path be filled with broken rails, an abandoned Express, and even a fallen Aeon?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: That's just sophistry. If that were true, then only the powerful would have the right to determine the future.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Unfortunately, that's exactly what happens. Another name for "the future" is "self-value."
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: While this world has its fair share of heroes who inspire people and garner admiration for their heroic deeds, the majority of ordinary people will never become heroes in their lifetime.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Some are born weak and vulnerable, some find themselves trapped in unfortunate circumstances, some fall victim to malice and cowardice. When it comes to survival, everyone is equal, and the weak can only watch as their value gets constantly diminished by external forces.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: That's why we should care for the weak and support them as if their suffering were our own... That's what the Odes of Harmony have always taught us.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: While the Harmony holds noble aspirations, the strong will always be strong, and the weak will always be weak, even in this carefree dream... Human nature contains greatness, but it also harbors inherent weaknesses that can't be eradicated.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: In the end, if people can't even secure their own survival, they won't care about the illusory future of equality. As long as the law of survival of the fittest prevails... there will always be fledglings crashing to their death.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Robin]: But if people don't live for the future, do they merely exist for survival? If even you, my brother, don't believe that the Harmony will save the weak, then which Aeon can make our dreams come true?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: People often forget that when the first bird took flight, the entire world envisioned a future where...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: No more fledglings would ever crash to their death.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Trustful Boy]: Are you reading, sister? What are you reading?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Guileless Girl]: Mr. Gopher Wood gave me a picture book! It's about the story of the Harmonic Strings!
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Guileless Girl]: If I could become a Chordmaster, I'd like to summon... Dominicus the Harmonious Choir! I want to sing with everyone and spread our wishes so that all can feel happiness and joy.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Trustful Boy]: I see. Then... I would summon the Harmonious Choir, too.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Guileless Girl]: Don't you... have a wish of your own, brother?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Trustful Boy]: Of course, I do. It's just that... it includes your wish and everyone else's. I long for a true paradise where everyone can find peace.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Guileless Girl]: Then let's build a stage there and invite everyone to our performance so that both our wishes come true, through the power of the Harmonious Choir.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Trustful Boy]: It's a deal then.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Guileless Girl]: Yeah, it's a deal! But how can I become a Chordmaster...?
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Trustful Boy]: ...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Sunday]: Maybe you'll have to become a star first.
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[The Only Path to Tomorrow][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Seabiscuit][Narration]: 8 system hours until Charmony Festival - Dreamflux Reef
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: You're back sooner than I thought... Any results?
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Yes... And now, it's up to us to forge ahead.
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: Hmph, since his last will has now been conveyed, my final mission is complete.
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: But, pardon me if I sound curt — it's good to have determination, but the path Mikhail left for you is not an easy one to tread...
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: Why else would he have chosen to sleep in solitude, staking everything on some Nameless in the future?
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: But you have the numbers, and in numbers comes strength. So that might just delay your inevitable a little more.
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Got any more encouraging words?
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: As I see it, relying on Welt's negotiations alone is far from enough. Regardless of whether the other party will be compliant, negotiating simply allows us to meet them as equals, it won't grant us an upper hand.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Penacony is our rival's home turf, and we already have very few chips left to play with. Rather than idly sit around while The Family's got us blocked off, an offensive approach might be a wiser course of action.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: We're more familiar with the Stellaron's properties than most, and since it's the key to stabilizing the sweet dream, it's vital to The Family's interests. By attacking their core interests, they're bound to retaliate hastily... and as the saying goes: Haste makes waste.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That's right — as long as we pose a threat to the Stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: But the problem is: On the eve of the Charmony Festival opening, how exactly are we going to get close to the theater? Family security will be airtight, and if we brute force it... Even if we succeed, it's too risky.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: ...
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: So... no one's gonna say anything? Then I'll raise my hand — I know the answer to this question!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You, of all people?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: What's that supposed to mean!? You'd better believe it!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Of course, you do! I never doubted you for a sec.
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: The Express crew would've been disbanded long ago if it weren't for me!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Looks like we have one more ace up our sleeves. Time for the masterstroke!
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Why are you speaking like the general of the Luofu?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: So, I heard that before the Charmony Festival begins, there will be a pageant to kick off the festival. It's called the... SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions or something, and it's going to be held in the Moment of Scorchsand.
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: As long as we clinch the top spot, we'll be able to attain the title of Festive Superstar and be able to personally bask in the graces of Miss Robin... Not that that's important. What's crucial is that we can enter the Grand Theater before the audience arrives!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: So how do we go about participating in these Festivity Auditions?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Heh-heh, I've already procured special invite tickets from Miss Robin's fan club!
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: To tell you the truth, I'd been preparing to join the auditions all along. But now it looks like even if I scrape through, I probably still won't have the chance to shake Miss Robin's hand...
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: So they're still running this thing eh... It was originally just a publicity stunt set up by Mikhail to drum up attention, but it looks like it might be worth a shot.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: We'll follow March's plan. Mr. Gallagher, will you be joining us?
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: ...I'm afraid I won't have the time. As a "virtual character"... I've already completed my final mission. Whether Penacony can awaken from this dream is all down to you.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Should we ever cross paths again, I'd love for you to visit the Express.
[Seabiscuit][Gallagher]: Alright. I'll have to add to that data bank of yours you've got on the Express.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: And Miss Firefly, we thank you for all your support. We're faced with a formidable enemy. As long as the Astral Express and Stellaron Hunters' objectives are aligned, we're willing to cooperate with you.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: We've already come this far together. I'd like to join you for the rest of your journey on Penacony. I'm pleased that we can finally fight shoulder-to-shoulder — I couldn't ask for a better ending.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: This is also the spirit of the Trailblaze. Now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
[Seabiscuit][Audition Broadcast]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Scorchsand Hall! This is where challengers thrive and Dreamchasers shine, all under the watchful eye of the entire universe!
[Seabiscuit][Audition Broadcast]: If you have ambition, dreams, and the drive — dear friends, the next superstar of Penacony's Charmony Festival could be you!
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Wow! They've really outdone themselves! I'm starting to get excited!
[Seabiscuit][Audition Broadcast]: Behold, here come four friends with spirits high and full of zeal! Are you aspiring to be the superstars of the festival?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Uh... Is he talking about us?
[Seabiscuit][Audition Broadcast]: Yes, you! There's no doubt about it. I see you have all the potential of a superstar in you!
[Seabiscuit][Excited Journalist]: Excuse me, you four, what are you hoping to get out of all this?
[Seabiscuit][Calm Journalist]: As the last group of contestants, how confident are you in overcoming all of the challenges?
[Seabiscuit][Underperforming Journalist]: Would you be open to a brief exclusive interview with us? It'll be quick!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: The Hunt's Journalist: Your journey is long and fraught with peril, yet under a sky blanketed by banners, you vie for the crown![Note 1]
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: The Beauty's Journalist: The Sword and Rose! Protect the Beauty! The Beauty, the Beauty! Magnificent and majestic!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: The Elation's Journalist: A knight's head is hard as steel! Brother Lan's focus is stubborn as a heel! We don't all have to be winners, but if we don't have fun, we'd all be sinners!
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: People are pouring in! Kinda feels like all sorts of baddies are showing up. Let's get in there quickly and enter the competition!
[Seabiscuit][???]: Ladies and gentlemen, please make way. Make way!
[Seabiscuit][Audition Broadcast]: Coming towards us now, is one of Penacony's top ten wealthiest tycoons, and the SoulGlad™ business empire's founder — Mr. Aideen!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the director of SoulGlad™'s factory, Aideen Leeda. My four friends, introduce yourselves to the audience across the cosmos!
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Mm, hello everybody, I'm Himeko, a Nameless from the Astral Express, and these are my companions.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Ahem... Don't you guys need to hide your identities?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Can't hide it anyways, Penacony is plastered with our posters... and because the Astral Express is so well-known, The Family won't dare to make any rash moves.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Hello everyone, I'm , and she's March 7th.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Hello everyone, I'm the Galactic Baseballer, and she's Say~Cheese~.
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Ah! Don't expose my net handle to everyone!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Hello everyone, I'm "Hello Everyone".
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Hey, be a bit more serious. We're live on air!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Is it really a good idea to have a talent show in this pivotal moment of our story?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: G—Given the situation, this is our best hope... Let's just get it over with quickly!
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Hello everyone, I'm March 7th! I'm an ordinary girl who loves adventures!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Hello everyone, I'm Firefly. Mm... I am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: So it's a bunch of Nameless guests! This final face-off is bound to be spectacular! Time is precious. My four friends, come with me!
[Seabiscuit][Audition Broadcast]: Grab a bottle of SoulGlad™, and make your dreams a blast!
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: This place is buzzing...
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: That's right! This venue is a miniature representation of that time known as the era filled with boundless possibilities.
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: Grab a bottle of SoulGlad™, and make your dreams a blast!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Nameless, your arrival reminds me of the grand occasion when Penacony was first established. I was still a young bright-eyed lad back then, lured here by the Watchmaker's ads, full of zeal and ready to make my first fortune in life.
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Once, during a particularly grueling day, I passed out and was resuscitated by a drink from Mr. Sousa. That sweet taste has since been etched in my mind, and that was what drove me to create the SoulGlad™ that we all know and love today!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: The Dreamchasing Era was truly a wondrous time. Ah, I miss those days... and the Watchmaker. Scorchsand Hall is my homage to that time of boundless possibilities.
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: I wholeheartedly hope you make it to the finish and emerge as the next superstars of Penacony! Now then, is there anything you'd like to say before the competition officially begins?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Nah, we'd win.
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Haha, that's the Trailblazing spirit! How about you, Miss March?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Can we get the ball rolling already?
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Haha, there's that swift and decisive Trailblazing spirit! How about you, Miss March?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Rest assured, we'll lose!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Haha, there's that... uh, the ever-vigilant Trailblazing spirit we all know!
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Hey! You should really fix that defeatist mentality of yours...
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Miss March, how about you?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Hello everyone! Next up, get ready for the mega March 7th adventure, where I'm going to break the speed run world record!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Trailblazing into the uncharted and challenging the limits! That's Miss March 7th for you! How about Miss Firefly?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: I hope that by the end of this journey... Everyone will have achieved the outcome that they hoped for.
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: A wonderful wish! Miss Himeko, what are you expecting from your team?
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Safety first, everyone.
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Haha, simple words, but full of warmth!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Waiting for you are three stages, each connected to that era. The first two stages offer two distinct paths to choose from, with unique challenges on each route!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: And in the last stage... you will face off against a champion who has defended the title to this very day — a beloved contender whose noble virtues are unrivaled!
[Seabiscuit][Aideen]: Those are the rules. Simple. Everyone clear? Now then, I hereby announce that the thirty-third Scorchsand Festival of the twentieth season, sponsored by SoulGlad™ Enterprises... has started!
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Everyone, as the Charmony Festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible... Factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: March and I haven't known Miss Firefly for too long, and aren't overly familiar with her... It'd probably be better if the two of you paired up.
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Fine by me. Let's do it!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: All right. I don't have a problem with that.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Enough chit-chat, let's do this!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Say what now? I get to pair up with Firefly and there's no catch?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: It'll be a shoo-in with me around.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Hold up, has any of you even bothered to ask me for my consent to this?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: Gah, time's ticking! Just listen to the grown-ups!
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: We'll split into the assigned groups then. Let's not waste time.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Welcome to the first stage of SoulGlad™ Enterprises' thirty-third Scorchsand Festival of the twentieth season: Dreamplay Fantasia! In this stage, you can choose between two challenges: The School of Acting or School of Action.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: In the School of Acting challenge, you have to complete three performances from three scripts and move the panel judges. In the School of Action challenge, you have to defeat three groups of enemies convincingly and reach the end.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Now... make your choice!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: The Stage of Dreams, for those who dare to dream! Welcome to the School of Acting stage!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: Step onto the stage and move the judges with your heartfelt performance! The next Cosmic Star of Penacony — could be you!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Competitors, allow me to introduce the rules of this challenge to you.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: There are three stages up ahead. On each, you will find an outline of a script. These three scripts were written by the legendary filmmaker, the Watchmaker, and depict various stories from Penacony's era of pioneering.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Your task is to bring those moments to life, find the right words, and act convincingly to make the judges feel the script's intended emotions. I wish you a successful performance!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Also, a bit of trivia: The record score for this stage is held by a participant with fiery red hair. His exceptional performance brought even the strictest judge to tears— It's like he wasn't even acting at all!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Ah... Haha... We are running out of time, so let's get this over with quickly, .
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: I wish you a successful performance!
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Oof, just take a look at this pair. Such star quality! Since you've come as a pair, I'll prep a two-person scene for you!
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: You two, are you ready?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Ready.
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Envision that you both, driven by the spirit of exploration, are arriving at the land of dreams that is Penacony for the first time. But! Instead of lush lands, you find yourselves amidst swirling sands and desolation, far from the paradise the Watchmaker described.
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: You're driving an old clunker through the wilderness of the Dreamscape, braving the cold wind, choking on the dust, and suddenly, a fierce Memory Zone Meme blocks your path...
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Now... , what line would you deliver to express your disappointment in Penacony?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Great! I love living on the wild side!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: No... that's not right... You're trying to express disappointment. Why do you sound so chipper?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: A brutish creature! Quick! Let's run it over!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Uh... Do you usually express disappointment this way...?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: What in tarnation is this hellhole! The Watchmaker is a big fat liar!
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Very good! Now, though you're disappointed, your screen partner is conversely very enthusiastic. Now, young lady! You will say...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: "Th—this is great! I love living on the... w—wild side!"
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Very good! Very intense! And then we cut to the story's next scene — you find a job mending the rails, but the days are long, and your endurance can't keep up, and you finally collapse in the endless expanse of desert...
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Suddenly! Sweet rain falls from the sky, wetting your lips, and rousing your spirits.
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Now... , what line will best express your surprise at this moment?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: O, Penacony, my Penacony! You truly abound with opportunities!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Just let me die of thirst instead!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That's not right... That line doesn't sound very "surprised".
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Perhaps we were never meant to succeed.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: We're already at the next scene! You need to convey surprise now, not disappointment...
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: But at this moment, your partner yet gazes into the sky, both her eyes closed. The rain drops fall, blurring her vision, and she tragically says...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: "P—Perhaps we were never meant to succeed... Right?"
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Fantastic! Both of you have an incredibly solid foundation in dialogue delivery! However, lines aren't everything in a performance. Please continue this story on the second stage...
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: Up next, you'll be challenged with a body language test.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: I hope these tests won't take too long...
[Seabiscuit][Dialogue Judge]: The depth of your dialogue delivery is remarkable! Best of luck with your results!
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: Here, you two are required to skillfully utilize body language to portray the story context I've laid out for you.
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: Picking up from where we left off, a heavy downpour saves you both stranded in the desert. This rain quenches the anger in your heart. You look to your companion, now completely devoid of fighting spirit, wanting to comfort her...
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: At this moment, what should you do to make her laugh?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: You seriously think that would make someone laugh?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: The test now is about body language... I don't think dialogue is allowed here.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: You look less like you want to make me laugh, and more like you want to abandon me.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Ah... Wha... *laughs*
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: Right answer! Your companion sees you rolling about in the sand, and thinks about the arduous obstacles along this journey. She can't help but let loose a laugh, rekindling hope in her heart — and so this girl...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: I'm... gonna get back on my feet and keep moving forward.
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: A tug at the heartstrings! The story continues to develop. The heavy rain leads you both to sense a business opportunity, so you start venturing into the umbrella industry. But just as the business begins to pick up, competitors start flooding the market with low-priced goods, squeezing your market share.
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: You have no choice — the goods you stockpiled at high prices have to be sold at a loss... This is a pretty self-destructive move which drives your business to the brink of bankruptcy. At this moment, what would you — who refuses to admit defeat — decide to do?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You turn around, leaving resolutely, muttering under your breath — "The hero's quest started with a bang. For this dream I've toiled and sang. If the dream repays me in pang, then I, the , will join the Annihilation Gang...."
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That's totally giving up... Come back here!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You drop to your knees with a resounding thud and start to repeatedly bash your head hard against the floor, kowtowing enthusiastically to your business rival. The key to a peaceful life lies in these five powerful words — "Show me mercy, pretty please!"
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Get up! No one wins a trade war by kowtowing...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You slam the table and rise up. They think you'll back down? Impossible! Dreamchasers can be knocked down, but never knocked out.
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: Fantastic! But it's a pity, your friend does not agree. Seeing that you're up to your eyeballs in debt, she sees nothing but despair in her future, and then...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Uh... I leave Penacony in utter disappointment... Is that okay?
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: Of course! Absolutely! I was this close to tears. Both of you possess exceptional acting talent!
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: However, the true test is yet to come. You're about to encounter the harshest judge this show has ever seen. You'll need to rely on perfect performances if you want to win them over.
[Seabiscuit][Body Language Judge]: Both of you possess excellent performative talent. I wish you all the best!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Welcome to the final stage. Actually, all the scenarios that you previously encountered, were all from the film Once Upon a Time in Dreams.
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Two companions arrive on Penacony with nothing but a dream. Their desire for achievement is met with continuous setbacks. Ultimately, one continues on, despite spiraling into debt, while the other concedes defeats and leaves.
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Many years later, their paths cross once more in the thriving Penacony, yet they refuse to acknowledge each other because...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: I became a big shot, but she ended up destitute.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: I fell into poverty, while she's leading a normal life.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: I'm leading a normal life, but she ended up destitute.
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Against the backdrop of a revitalized Penacony, the joy of reunion mixes with the sorrow of past separation, the awkwardness of being strangers, and the shyness of a long-awaited encounter, all converging at this very moment.
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Give it a shot. Try and convey this bittersweet scene to me — bring it to life with precise and emotive acting!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Ugh... Is this ever going to end? I know, why don't you try that... clockwork thing you used before.
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Your performance is far from satisfactory!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Angry
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: CUT!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: A mogul who went from rags-to-riches treating a former companion with such disdain — it just makes my blood boil!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Huh? But we haven't even done anything... Is her imagination running wild again?
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Brilliant! Your portrayal outdoes the original! It's simply... simply... simply —
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Beautiful!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Happy
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: CUT!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: I never imagined that such a sad scene could be portrayed by you two in such a joyful and heartwarming way — two people sharing a long-cherished friendship, as if time and status meant nothing to them!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Huh? But we haven't even done anything... Is her imagination running wild again?
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Brilliant! Your portrayal outdoes the original! It's simply... simply... simply —
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Beautiful!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Sad
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: CUT!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Huh? We haven't even done anything...
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: It's so... so touching, your portrayal outdoes the original! It's simply... simply... simply —
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Beautiful!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: ...
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Dull lines, stiff movements... this can scarcely be described as acting!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: A mogul who went from rags-to-riches treating a former companion with such disdain — it just makes my blood boil!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: You pass with full marks!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Two people sharing a long-cherished friendship, as if time and status meant nothing to them! My heart brims with hope at the sight of such an ending.
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: You pass with full marks!
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: Many actors depend on emotions to move people, but your performance depicted a grief so profound it brings tears to one's eyes... and even reminds me of my past...
[Seabiscuit][Strict Judge]: You pass with full marks!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: The champion's crown awaits you on the stage! Welcome to the arena of Action Stars!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: Please make your way to the stage and vanquish those malevolent scoundrels with your dazzling fighting techniques! The title of Penacony's next big action star awaits you!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Competitors, allow me to introduce the rules of this challenge to you.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: There are a total of three stages up ahead, each with their own challenges. The enemies you will contend against are antagonists from the film Once Upon a Time in Dreams. Defeat them swiftly and decisively to set a new record!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: It's worth mentioning that the fastest time for this stage was achieved by a contestant with fiery red hair. Astoundingly, he overcame all enemies across the three stages in only five minutes!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Time is of the essence. Let's make this quick, .
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Contestants, you are about to confront the monsters of the Primordial Dreamscape! During this period, Penacony was nothing but a barren wasteland — the Dreamscape was fraught with strife and disorder, with Memory Zone Memes running rampant!
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: As Dreamchasers who've come to Penacony, defeating them is your first step towards success!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Bubble Hound who's been forced to play a monster: Aoo — Woo — Woof woof woof! All the SoulGlad™ is ours! Don't even think about plundering the SoulGlad™ from us!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Bubble Hound who's been forced to play a monster: SoulGlad™... My SoulGlad™... Raawrr...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Pretty simple... I just hope these tests don't take too long.
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Congratulations on becoming the first group of Dreamchasers! Answering the call from the Watchmaker, you are disappointed to learn that Penacony isn't paved with gold. Resigned to your current plight, you start from the hierarchical dredges, biding your time for a chance at success.
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Just as you're about to give up, a downpour sparks a business idea — you enter the umbrella business! But just as things are looking up, you encounter a competitor. Defeat them and emerge victorious from this trade war!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Why is our opponent... SoulGlad?
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Because, this is SoulGlad™ Enterprises' thirty-third Festivity Auditions of the twentieth season!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Isn't this just product placement...?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Sweet Gorilla who's been forced to play a monster: To safeguard the integrity of SoulGlad™, I will soar high into the sky and become its shiniest star, whoosh!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Sweet Gorilla who's been forced to play a monster: The world kisses me with pain, and I provide with SoulGlad™ in return... Whoosh...
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Congratulations to our two Dreamchasers for establishing yourselves as budding stars in Penacony. However, now you face a competitor selling at low prices, pushing you to the brink of bankruptcy.
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: No matter how lengthy the battle, you always persevere. Topple this powerful opponent, and the tides will turn, paving a way to success!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Lil' Beyond Overcooked who's been forced to play a monster: None will take my SoulGlad™ away from me! I will use the Transmutation Arcanum to turn into a dinosaur! *rawrr*
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Big Beyond Overcooked who's been forced to play a monster: O dinosaur, devour my enemies, grawwrr!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: The Beyond Overcooked who've been forced to play monsters: Grab a bottle of SoulGlad™, and make your dreams a blast! Grawwrr!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Lil' Beyond Overcooked who's been forced to play a monster: Grawwrr... The body withers, but the SoulGlad™ name shall not...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Big Beyond Overcooked who's been forced to play a monster: Grawwrr... You truly are a beast, more than I can ever be...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That should do it... Okay, let's go. Mr. Yang is waiting for us.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Isn't this fight way off from the actual storyline?
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Transforming into a dinosaur isn't imaginative enough for you? This is the sort of magic only seen on Penacony. Anyway, let's get back on track. Where were we? Oh, that's right—
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: After an extended battle, you finally emerged victorious, but the companion who journeyed to Penacony with you chose to leave — having lost all hope.
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: In the years that followed, you encountered each other once more on the prosperous streets of Penacony, but dared not call out to one another. Perhaps akin to the lingering regret of every Dreamchaser.
[Seabiscuit][Judge]: Well done! You brought to life the thrilling action scenes from Once Upon a Time in Dreams with your fighting skills!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: We've passed the test, but we ought to hurry up... The Stellaron is at stake.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Looks like we won... Let's hurry up and get to the next stage.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Congrats to both of you for clearing the stage! But more importantly: Are you having fun? Fun is more important than success!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Look at the time! You've finished much faster than that red-haired contestant did!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That red-haired contestant... Who is that exactly?
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: You'll find out eventually, but only if you clear the next test first! Welcome to the second stage of the thirty-third Scorchsand Festival in the twentieth season, sponsored by SoulGlad™ Enterprises — Gunfire Time!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: You have the option to choose "Gunfire" and undergo Brother Hanu's trial, or "Time," where you'll face Clockie's trial.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Now... make your choice!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Dear friends, welcome to the wonderful world created by the Watchmaker! Awaiting you up ahead is the titular character from the beloved Clockie animation — Clockie!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: It's said that the Watchmaker dreamed up the idea of Clockie when he was just a boy. Back then, he was merely an apprentice in a clock shop, and one night, he dreamt that all the broken clocks started sprouting arms and legs.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Like a skilled navigator, he steered them towards the right path! As a classic figure who grew up with many, Clockie truly shaped a generation, solidifying the Watchmaker's pivotal role in popular culture!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Contestants, may you have a wonderful time with Clockie!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: The trial of Time... I hope it won't waste too much of our time.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Am I... just a failed experiment?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That statue... Did it just speak?
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Am I... just a failed experiment?
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: ...I'm just an expendable failure of a clock, aren't I?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Hello, I'd like to play Dreamscape Ticker.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: "Play"... So, I'm not just a failed clock, I'm also a failed toy.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: So, this stage is requiring us to cure this thing with a whole therapy session now?
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Don't be naive, buddy. Failure isn't a sickness — it's a sin, and sins can't be cured.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: We've got an urgent matter to attend to... Can you please let us pass already?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: I know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but Penacony is actually in danger right now... We have to prevent it at all costs, sooner rather than later.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Oh, another group of opportunistic challengers. Sorry, though I may be a failure of a clock, I still have my principles.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: You guys are just like the other challengers. You want to enter my inner self? Then please, be my guest. But you won't find anything worthwhile... I'm just a failed piece.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: See, I'm just empty inside.
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Tick-tock, it's time for me to make an appearance!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: How come you're here too?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Where did you come from?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Ah, the plot thickens. Help!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Clockie? I can also see him... Is this character part of the show?
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: In Dreamville, Clockie is everywhere and can do anything! Like... right now, I could solve this problem with your Big Ticker pal, tick-tock!
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: I can't believe it's actually Clockie! Why would you come and visit a failure of a clock like me for no reason?
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: You see, we're all clocks, we're family! I want to help you be happy! Tell your pal Clockie what's troubling you!
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: I... I came across a startling revelation yesterday. Apparently, Dreamscape Ticker isn't the same as Clockie at all. It's just a discarded prototype from Clockie's early development.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Please... just leave me be, Clockie. I just don't know how to face you... because I'm just a failure.
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Oh dear, seeing it like this is utterly heart-wrenching. But fear not! We're here to help it rediscover the missing parts of its inner self and guide it out of despair!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Ah... I guess even Troupe members can experience existential crises...
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Don't worry, miss. I've already pinpointed its missing parts!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Over here, my friends! Better be fast like Hamster Ball Knight!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: )
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: This must be one of the missing parts that Big Ticker needs. That's great!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: We're here! There's a missing part on the opposite side... But how do we get over there?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: There's also a "Dream's Eye" left here by a Dreamweaver... We're running out of time, we'll have to use it if necessary.
[Seabiscuit][???]: Help, help, tweet! I'm about to end up as a roast dinner, tweet!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Tick-tock! Do I hear someone calling out for help?
[Seabiscuit][???]: Tweet! Help, help help, tweet! This fella's body is boiling hot, tweet!
[Seabiscuit][???]: Is anyone there, tweet? I can't take it anymore, tweet!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Oh dear, it's an origami bird! What's it doing in Beyond Overcooked's tail?
[Seabiscuit][???]: Is that Clockie, tweet? Please save me, tweet! I'm being roasted alive, tweet!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: A roasted bird! This is horrible — let's save it, quickly!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Yank!
[Seabiscuit][Origami Bird]: Phew... thank you guys, tweet. I feel I'm about seventy percent cooked, tweet!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Thank goodness you're ok! But why did you burrow yourself into that fella's tail?
[Seabiscuit][Origami Bird]: Because that fella stole one of Mr. Big Ticker's parts, tweet! I wanted to help retrieve it, but I accidentally got myself stuck in the oven, tweet... Go ahead and get it, but be careful, it's hot, tweet!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: )
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: An inner self fragment belonging to the Sweet Dreams Troupe... This is just too surreal.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: )
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: We've gathered all the missing parts... Let's hurry back, we don't want to keep Big Ticker waiting.
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: We're back! As long as you have these, you'll be able to find closure, tick-tock!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Tick-tock! Hey there my gray-haired friend, we still haven't helped Big Ticker find closure yet!
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Wow! This sudden surge of joy...
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: It's working, tick-tock! Next, we just need to enter its Emoscape, help connect its pathways, and we're done!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Oh dear... What's going on in here? Your inner self is a mess!
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: I'm not qualified to be the real Clockie. Just give up, Clockie!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Hmph, no! This is unacceptable. You have to face your fears!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Since it's come down to this, I'll have to use Clockwork...
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Ta-dah, success!
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Thank you, Clockie... If not for you, I'd never be able to connect with people like this — you helped me find myself again!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: No problem at all! As the guardian of Dreamville, it's what I'm here for! Tick-tock!
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: My friends, you still have other important things to do, right?
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Go forth, my friends — when the moment comes, all the Dream Tickers and I will cheer for you!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: It's all done... Victory is in sight. Let's head to the final stage.
[Seabiscuit][Big Ticker]: Go forth, my friends — when the moment comes, all the Dream Tickers and I will cheer for you!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Dear friends, welcome to the enchanting universe created by the Watchmaker! Awaiting you is the morally dubious yet ever-charming character from the animated Clockie series — Hanu!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: It is said that these cartoon characters were inspired by the Watchmaker's own experiences. According to research by Clockie scholars, the original Hanu of reality shared a deep friendship with the Watchmaker, akin to comrades-in-arms.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Enter into the world of Hanu via the TV by the entrance, and partake in an enchanting and suspenseful story with him! Good luck in there!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: If it's a Gunfire trial... We should be able to settle this with a fight, right? I hope this won't waste too much of our time.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Ready? One, two, three...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Are we... both in control of this Hanu character?
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Very good! Looks like you've got the hang of it!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: In this Hanu's Adventure episode, Boss Stone has gathered his battleships for an assault on Dreamville! Old Buzzfly, Cousin Wolf and Bombhead are all raring to go... The brave Hanu must thwart their advance and protect his home!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Alas, Hanu presently is ill-equipped to fend off the Malevolent Mischief Makers, which is why he is preparing to seek out the Puzzle Gentlemen's aid. Go forth and speak to him!
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Oh, brave Hanu... You look like you could really use some help.
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Long time no see, Hanu. You look pretty stressed out. How about an intense and thrilling game of Dream Jigsaw to blow off some steam?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Actually, the plot dictates that you directly provide aid to us.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Actually, the plot dictates that you directly provide aid to us." - You really want to say this to the Dreamweaving Gentleman, but given your character's design, you can only respond with a cool *hmph*.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Is Dream Jigsaw really that intense and thrilling?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Is Dream Jigsaw really that intense and thrilling?" You really want to say this to the Dreamweaver Gentleman, but given your character's design, you can only respond with a cool *hmph*.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Gosh, this is the first time I've ever seen you crouch down.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Gosh, this is the first time I've ever seen you crouch down." You really want to say this to the Dreamweaver Gentleman, but given your character's design, you can only respond with a cool *hmph*.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Let out a really cool sounding *hmph*
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You let out a cool *hmph*. It might just be the coolest hmph in history.
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Oh, my, are you telling me that Boss Stone has rallied the villains to seize Dreamville? What a dreadful twist of fate...
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Listen closely, Hanu. I'm aware you're in need of a suitable weapon, and I also know there's one just upstairs...
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: But, you know what? You'll have to play an exhilarating round of Dream Jigsaw first. No jigsaw, no moving forward.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: That's not fair! You have to help me now.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "It's not fair! You have to help me." — You really want to say this to the Dreamweaver Gentleman, but given your character's design, you can only respond with a cool *hmph*.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: What do the weapon and Dream Jigsaw have to do with one another?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "What is the relationship between the weapon and the Dream Jigsaw?" You really want to say this to the Dreamweaver Gentleman, but given your character's design, you can only respond with a cool *hmph*.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Dreamville's in danger! How do you not understand the predicament?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreamville is in danger! Don't you understand?" You really want to say this to the Dreamweaver Gentleman, but given your character's design, you can only respond with a cool *hmph*.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Let out a really cool sounding *hmph*
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You make a cool *hmph*. Only someone as cool as you could produce such a cool *hmph*. Perfection!
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Now, scurry along, Hanu. But tread carefully – two ne'er-do-wells are also eyeing those jigsaw pieces... Either outsmart them with a quick knockout, or ensure they don't catch you in the act.
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: I can't wait to see you finish the Dream Jigsaw... Best of luck, Hanu!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Let's stay alert and make sure those monsters don't spot us.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: It appears we can't climb the stairs in our current state...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Look up there... If we can push that thing down, do you think that would do the trick?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces... Let's hurry back.
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Oh my! The exquisite sensation of perfect alignment... My organizational itch has been quite thoroughly scratched!
[Seabiscuit][Puzzle Gentlemen]: Hurry now, Hanu! Touch that TV set and transform back into your old self. Then, head upstairs — your weapon awaits you there!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Are such haphazard instructions really okay...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Disconnecting from that thing so suddenly has left me feeling slightly disoriented.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Is that... Hanu?
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph.
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph... Hmph!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: What are you talking about?
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph? Hmph.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Is staying in character this much REALLY necessary...?
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph... Hmph.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Aha, I know the answer for this one! "Hmph".
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph! Hmph.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Penacony's in danger. Can you get out of the way?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: I know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but Penacony is actually in danger right now... We have to prevent it at all costs, sooner rather than later.
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph? Hmph... Hmph.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: What exactly is he... talking about?
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Tick-tock, it's time for me to make an appearance!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: How come you're here too?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Where did you come from?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Ah, the plot thickens. Help!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Clockie? I can also see him... Is this character part of the show?
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: In Dreamville, Clockie is everywhere and can do anything! Like... right now, I can be your translator, tick-tock!
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph... Hmph!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: Hanu says: "Battle, we must do battle!"
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: Hmph, hmph, hmph...
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: "The enemy is at our doorstep, and we have no path of retreat. For the future of Dreamville..."
[Seabiscuit][Brother Hanu]: ...Hmph!
[Seabiscuit][Clockie]: "...Touch that suspicious-looking TV right now!"
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: So they just jumped inside that TV...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Sheesh... The logic in this plot and dialogue is really being pushed to its limits...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Well, here we go again... Ready?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: I am gradually getting used to this... who knows, I might even be able to perform some high-level moves with Hanu.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Oh? Did someone say "high-level moves" just now? That's right, pal! The upcoming script is just exploding with all sorts of high-level shenanigans!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Last we saw, Hanu was preparing for battle. Suddenly, he hears heavy footsteps coming from the hallway. The Malevolent Mischief Makers have broken into his home!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: But brave Hanu won't go down without a fight! He instantly sprints for the storage room, ready for a do-or-die showdown against the baddies...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: But... we still don't have any weapons in hand...
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Guess what? Hanu's favorite bazooka just so happens to be in that storage room! So get a move on!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: What a coincidentally convenient plot twist... It'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: The storage room... It's behind the shelves, right?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: He wasn't lying. There's actually a bazooka here.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Oh no, the not-so-unstoppable Hanu has actually fallen! Quickly, return to the battlefield and seek revenge against the bad guys!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Oh my, the unstoppable Hanu has been spotted! Everyone, please proceed with caution!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Now... we should have a way of dealing with those baddies.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: This thing feels just like the Soaring Locust II...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Careful, looks like we've got more company! Get ready to fire!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Here we go again... but no big deal, we're pretty handy with this bazooka now.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That should be all of them, right?
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Oh my! Hanu is on a streak! Everyone, the stage is complete, quickly head through the TV to the next stage!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Well, that's that. But it is gonna be hard to let go of this bazooka...
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: ...Uhm, nevermind. Let's hurry over to the next stage.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Congratulations to both of you! You've overcome all obstacles and proven yourselves. But unfortunately... there is only one who can be Penacony's Festive Superstar.
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: In the final stage, you will face the defending champion. If you fail, you will lose the opportunity to become the Festive Superstar!
[Seabiscuit][Guide]: Welcome to the thirty-third Scorchsand Festival's third stage in the twentieth season, sponsored by SoulGlad™ Enterprises — Superstar Showdown!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: :
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Please wait! ...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: By the glorious light of Beauty! I never thought I would see you again. In such turbulent times, your kind faces are as spring's gentle breeze, bringing solace to my scorched heart!
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Are you... a Knight of Beauty?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Ahhhwww?
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Hear ye! The rosy glow of the Beauty has rendered you speechless — what an honor!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: So the red-haired contestant was you all along!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: You've already heard of my humble title elsewhere? I am deeply honored!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Will you be participating in the Charmony Festival as well?
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Upon hearing of the impending festivities, I commanded the One and Only to bring me to Penacony with full haste. Alas, in a cosmos unguarded by the Beauty, disorder prevails, thus my passage was delayed by tending to the sick and injured...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Fortunately, the Mini Rabbit Mech Pilot, Stray Cat Duelist, Galactic Ninja, and Quad-drive Intellitron, along with thirty-two other souls in distress, all emerged from their predicaments safe and sound... I then led them all here to revel in the harmony with the countless other splendid beings.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Is this the Beauty? It's dazzling...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: I do not deserve such praise! Unfortunately, that dashing IPC Ambassador, whose radiance matches that of a beautiful peacock, remains in a woeful state... How I wish he too could partake in this splendid occasion.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Okay, let's get back to business. Since fate has brought us together, it stands to reason that you both seek the accolade of the audition's victor, correct?
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Though upon arrival, I was once mistaken for a towering, silver-armored fugitive with fiery red flames, due to my lack of eloquence... it matters not, for all these trials stem from the Land of Dream's Beauty.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: What matters is that I now stand before you — our paths have crossed. I, Argenti of the Knights of Beauty, am humbly requesting for a battle with you both in the name of the Code of Chivalry!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: If I am fortunate enough to emerge victorious, kindly grant me passage to the crown of victory and recognize that...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: ...Idrila, the Beauty, is the most peerless beauty of them all!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You're quite the savior, aren't ya...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: I do not deserve such praise! Unfortunately, that dashing IPC Ambassador, whose radiance matches that of a beautiful peacock, remains in a woeful state... How I wish he too could partake in this splendid occasion.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Okay, let's get back to business. Since fate has brought us together, it stands to reason that you both seek the accolade of the audition's victor, correct?
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Though upon arrival, I was once mistaken for a towering, silver-armored fugitive with fiery red flames, due to my lack of eloquence... it matters not, for all these trials stem from the Land of Dream's Beauty.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: What matters is that I now stand before you — our paths have crossed. I, Argenti of the Knights of Beauty, am humbly requesting for a battle with you both in the name of the Code of Chivalry!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: If I am fortunate enough to emerge victorious, kindly grant me passage to the crown of victory and recognize that...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: ...Idrila, the Beauty, is the most peerless beauty of them all!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: I'm busy saving the world. Could you please make way?
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Saving the world? What a righteous act of Beauty! If that's the case...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: ...No, that won't do. The rules of the contest are sacred and inviolable, just like the Beauty.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Hmm... What would be the noblest choice...?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: We need to seal the Stellaron on Penacony.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: That's right. This magnificent dream is built upon the Stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Oh? To encounter deeds so vile they stir one's very soul...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: However, present-day Penacony bears no marks of the Stellaron's taint and The Family has always been renowned for spreading Harmony... How can I be sure your words hold truth?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: Tell the truth about the Watchmaker and the Stellaron.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: If I'm not wrong, the Knights of Beauty also received an invitation from the Watchmaker, right?
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: That's right. But what does this have to do with the Stellaron?
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Actually, we've already met the Watchmaker...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You revealed to Argenti all the truths about the Watchmaker and the Penacony Stellaron...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Hmm...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: It's clear to me now. Evidently, you are traveling in pursuit of the Beauty's ideals.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Go forth, my dear friend, beautiful Miss, the audition's crown is yours to claim! I shall remain here, gazing from afar as you bask in the limelight, joining the audience in offering you the most heartfelt cheers and applause.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Thank you, Knight of Beauty! We don't have much time left... May we meet again.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You don't trust your dear friend?!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Hmm...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Forgive me, my dear friends. If you cannot present irrefutable evidence, I must not yield, lest I dishonor the name of the Knights of Beauty.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: But if what you say is true... In the name of Beauty, let us use this fated duel to test your mettle!
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: I'm begging you, all I speak is the truth!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Hmm...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Forgive me, my dear friends. If you cannot present irrefutable evidence, I must not yield, lest I dishonor the name of the Knights of Beauty.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: But if what you say is true... In the name of Beauty, let us use this fated duel to test your mettle!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Dear friends, please ready yourselves for this trial set forth by the Beauty!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Your convictions, my friends, are indeed awe-inspiring...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: It's a pity... The laurels of victory belong to Idrila!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: That's enough! I have come to grasp the sincerity of your cause... I yield!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Beautiful! Beautiful! Truly a captivating contest! It is through you that I realize, to uphold the honor of Idrila, I must further hone my skills... What a beautiful lesson indeed!
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Go forth, my dear friend, beautiful Miss, the audition's crown is yours to claim...
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: I shall remain here, gazing from afar as you bask in the limelight, joining the audience in offering you the most heartfelt cheers and applause.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: We don't have much time... May fate allow us to meet again, Knight of Beauty.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: In that case... let's make our way to the end.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: Penacony's really thronging with talent... I hope we make it in time.
[Seabiscuit][Argenti]: Go forth! The champion's stage belongs to the both of you... Bask in the glory you deserve!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: Congratulations to  and Firefly on becoming this Scorchsand Festival's champions!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: We look forward to their amazing entrance in the Charmony Festival!
[Seabiscuit][Announcement]: Let's give a round of applause to our aspiring young guests!
[Seabiscuit][???]: Congratulations to the both of you on becoming the Festive Superstars of this year's Charmony Festival. Before entering the Grand Theater...
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: I, on behalf of the organizers, extend my sincere congratulations to you, wishing you joy under THEIR radiance.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: What are you doing here?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: You already worked things out with the Dreammaster?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: All I get are "sincere congratulations?" Where are my Stellar Jades?
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: *laughs* Your endeavors are worthy of extra recognition, and I've taken steps to ensure that. However, this reward is not a material one... but rather the opportunity for an open and honest communication between us.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: As previously promised, my sister, Mr. Yang, and I have met with the Dreammaster. We delved into the truth about Penacony and its Stellaron, and have come to a consensus—
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Both I and the Oak Family cannot acquiesce to your request.
[Seabiscuit][Firefly]: ...Just as expected.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: We acknowledge the perspective of you Nameless — Penacony does require change, but not as you propose. The Planet of Festivities cannot and will not revert to a place characterized by chaos, disorder, or anarchy.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Through your journey of overcoming obstacles, you must have glimpsed the essence of that era: The vulnerable ruthlessly eliminated, equality non-existent, commonfolk living precarious lives, eking out a dreary existence...
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Ultimately, only "heroes" like yourselves manage to achieve success.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: But I would dare ask: , if you did not possess the special status of having a Stellaron, and you were but an anonymous and frail member among the masses... Which Penacony would you prefer?
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: A dystopia for the survival of the fittest, or a Sweetdream Paradise for all?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: There's nothing wrong with being the fittest...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: A Sweetdream Paradise doesn't sound too bad...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: I don't know. Why're you asking me?
[Seabiscuit][March 7th]: That's not the point! , don't let him mislead you.
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: Mr. Sunday, even if the members of the Oak Family can't fully agree on what to do about the Stellaron, now's not exactly the time to be holding an extensive discourse about Penacony's past and future, is it?
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: The Stellaron issue concerns the life and death of everyone on Penacony. If anyone has a better suggestion, the Crew is more than willing to listen. Also, it'd be best to tell us the ins and outs of that meeting—
[Seabiscuit][Himeko]: ...This way, we'll at least know what Welt and Miss Robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Ah, Navigator, that is precisely my intention. With all present, let's begin by discussing the details of that meeting.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Let's talk about our tribulations and choices, our ideals and beliefs...
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: And our final course of action, the only path to take.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: A while ago...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": ...You mean to say, that for the longest time, there have been scoundrels who would use the Charmony Festival that I have bequeathed to the masses... as a tool to realize their ambition?
[Seabiscuit][Robin]: Indeed, Dreammaster. Once the Charmony Festival begins, the Stellaron's powers, along with the song will be broadcast across the entire planet of Penacony... And then, everyone in their dreams will be unable to awaken.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Hmm, this is indeed surprising to me. The Dreamscape is maintained by the collective effort of the Five Families. If someone were to use the Charmony Festival to recklessly disseminate the power of the Stellaron, this individual must hold a position of great authority...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Do you have any suspects?
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: I'd like to ask: Did you really not know of the Stellaron's existence?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Heh... I would've never thought that this Nameless would point the spear at me, quite astonishing indeed.
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: If I have offended, the Astral Express extends its sincere apologies... but the current circumstances are dire, and leave no room for meticulous inquiry. We're doing this out of concern for the Dreamscape's safety... so if you could, please alleviate our concerns.
[Seabiscuit][Robin]: Dreammaster, it's just to prove that the Charmony Festival has nothing to do with the Stellaron. If we're being overly cautious... I will return to the stage to offer tribute in song, just per the arrangement.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Hmm...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Sunday, Robin, I've watched you two grow up, and know your dispositions like the back of my hand. Both of you right now, can surely be lauded as THEIR most devout advocates... I already know your resolve.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": The magnitude of this matter is enormous, and cannot be taken lightly. Since Mr. Yang has asked with such earnestness, I will personally respond in kind. If there is a need, the entire Oak Family will be mobilized to heed your call.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Sunday, might I ask you to beseech THEM to cast THEIR light unto me, and question me in THEIR stead, so that no lies may be concealed?
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: I will do as you command.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Robin, could I entrust you to be present as a witness, to document the truth, and to proclaim my innocence, so that all slander may be utterly dispelled?
[Seabiscuit][Robin]: I will do as you command.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": May thy will be carried out on earth... just as it is in the heavens.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: "Oh, Triple-Faced Soul, please sear his tongue and palms with a hot iron, so that he will not be able to fabricate lies and make false vows."
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Let us begin. There is nothing else to prepare.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Understood.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: "Question: Have you devoted your life to your God, never worshiping other Gods?"
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Naturally.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: "Do you love your God as you do yourself, always heeding THEIR admonishments?"
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Naturally.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: "Have you strayed from the path expected by your God, betraying THEIR name?"
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Never.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: "Have you ever been inordinate with your asks of your God, coveting more than the foundation of the creation itself?"
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Never.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Then, a final question...
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: "Do you swear to fulfill all vows, past, present and future?"
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": With the Aeon as my witness, if I do not deliver on my words, or if I renege on my vows, may I be cursed in accordance with divine law.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: ...THEY have seen your faith, and have endorsed your faith. With this, it can be evidenced—
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: Just a moment.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: What is it, Mr. Yang?
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: ...I have another question I hope to have answered.
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: To my understanding, The Family's harmony and prosperity have never relied on so-called "divine laws"...
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: The "God" you both mentioned... are THEY truly Xipe?
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Mr. Yang should know that those belonging to The Family toil together as if they were kin, embracing solidarity and unity under THEIR Light. All duplicity is laid bare before the Harmony.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Such a delicate and complex symphony, which other God could perfectly harmonize this if not for the Great One, Xipe?
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: "Perfectly harmonize"... Therein lies the problem. It isn't an outsider lurking in the shadows who changed the Harmony, but a dissonance that has surreptitiously emerged from within this very symphony itself.
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: In the distant past, there existed an Aeon. With one flick of the wrist, THEY crafted the laws of the cosmos. THEIR followers formed the Beyond the Sky Choir, spreading solemn and reverent hymns throughout the universe.
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: Later, THEY fell. The route traversed by this Aeon clashed with the Harmony, ultimately being absorbed and fused into it. The chorus that once reverberated across worlds fell silent, and when it echoed anew, it was transformed into the hymn of Harmony...
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: Though an Aeon may perish, paths with no masters still linger. In the all-forgiving Harmony... echoes of bygone dissonance may subtly arise.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Mr. Yang...
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Being overly astute can be a detriment, especially when you find yourself alone, and without allies.
[Seabiscuit][Welt]: Hmph... so this is how it is.
[Seabiscuit][Narration]: "Dreammaster": For the sake of our grand cause, Sunday, please afford these two an opportunity to rest.
[Seabiscuit][Robin]: What...?
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Sorry, Robin, it's just you... I did not wish for you to know this. It's a pity that things have turned out this way.
[Seabiscuit][Robin]: So this is the true reason I can't sing? The shadow that envelops Penacony is actually...
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: We were never children of the Harmony. Our ideal paradise... could not have been crafted by Xipe. True bliss can only be guaranteed by the "one" who transcends the many.
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: Within the foundation of law, humanity establishes civilization...
[Seabiscuit][Sunday]: And through Harmony, we obtain Order.

[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: Unbelievable, to think that there would be... remnants of the Order on Penacony.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: What have you done with Mr. Yang and Miss Robin!?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Don't worry. I just gave them some time alone to ponder their fates.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: You should know that these actions make you an enemy of the Astral Express.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Should we need to stand against the Nameless, it would only be myself and the Oak family involved. But we haven't reached that point yet, have we?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Your efforts for the justice of Penacony are evident to everyone and have been widely observed.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: You want to talk terms with us?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Smart kid. You're just as sharp as the other one.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Patience is a virtue. However, I won't hold it against you. On the contrary, I'm here to make my intentions clear.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Give Mr. Yang back to us, now!
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Oh I intend to, but that hinges on the outcome of this negotiation.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: If it is the Order that drove you to imprison Welt and Robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: You're mistaken, Miss Himeko. They are in very safe hands, and just as The Family has always proclaimed — no one can be harmed in the Dreamscape, least of all in the beautiful new world belonging to the Order.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Penacony and the entire universe have witnessed far too much innocent bloodshed. The strong wield their blades against the weak, and the victors push the vanquished to the brink of life...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Natural selection — the world abides by this principle, establishing the well-being of humanity atop the corpses of the downtrodden. Only we, or rather I, possess the power to put an end to this farce.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: So you've decided to resurrect a dead Aeon? No one's ever done such a thing.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: If Miss Himeko is interested, let's draw back the veil and speak candidly. I've always firmly believed that people can understand one another through peaceful means.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I'm willing to divulge the unembellished truth as to the intentions of the Order's Pathstriders, so that you will make better judgment for the Astral Express, for Penacony, and for this stretch of the universe. Words can hardly do justice to the beauty of that ideal...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: So come with me, everyone. Let us retrace our steps and see once again where this road leads.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: Huh, where'd he go?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Welcome. This isn't any location in Penacony's Dreamscape. It's my inner world. The reason the scenery before you remains unchanged is because your consciousness has drawn on similar concepts to fill in the gaps.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: You've imprisoned us?
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Who in their right mind would expose their inner-self like this?
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: That means...
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: Did you do the same to Welt?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: It's a "tuning" process, stronger in effect and more draining on the mind.  has experienced it before, so  should understand what it entails.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Tuning allows you to intuitively grasp my feelings, which also means that I cannot hide anything from you.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Now, everyone, please look at the huge screen. The road we once took begins here.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: From this point on, you will witness the numerous decisions I've faced. I've selected a portion of these to share with you.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I believe after going through similar predicaments, you'll be able to better understand my thoughts.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Let's begin. The first decision: A story about a baby bird.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: This story happened when Robin and I were very young. We were victims of the Stellaron Disaster, and The Family's Mr. Gopher Wood — who would later become the Dreammaster of Penacony — saw that we siblings had no one to turn to and took us in.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Later on, Robin and I lived a time with nary a care in the world. One day, after dinner, while my younger sister and I were lounging about in Mr. Gopher Wood's yard, we spotted a fledgling Charmony Dove all on its own.
[Beauty and Destruction][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Small Town Grotesque 2.mp4
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: That baby bird was tiny, it didn't even have all of its feathers, and it couldn't sing. When we found it, it was already on its last breath, having fallen into a shrub — probably abandoned by its parents.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: We decided to build a nest for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter was unusually cold, with fierce winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many poisonous bugs and wild beasts in the vicinity...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: It was clear that if we left the fledgling in the yard, it stood no chance of surviving until spring. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the adults to fashion a cage for it.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: We decided that when it regained its strength enough to spread its wings, we would release it back into the wild. The tragic part — something that we'd never considered — was that this bird's fate had already been determined long before this moment...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Its destiny was determined by our momentary whim.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Now, I pass the power of choice to you all. Faced with this situation, what choice would you make?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Stick to the original plan, and build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Or build a cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I eagerly await your answer.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: That guy just casually throws this kind of question at us? What exactly is his deal? But fine, I'll answer I guess...
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: If it were me... I guess I'd choose to build a cage for the little Charmony Dove.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: After all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something... And that'd just be too sad.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: It looks like he really has no intention of imprisoning us. If it's just a quiz, I suppose it's fine to humor him.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: Back to the question: I would personally choose to build the little Charmony Dove a cage.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: No special reason. I do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky... But if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: I can't decipher his intentions right now... but based solely on the question, I would probably choose to build that dove a cage...
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: Even if I was gonna release it back into the sky, it'd have to be strong enough to fly first. If I left it where I found it... I fear it'd never get the chance to fly ever again.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Choose "Build a bird nest on the spot"
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Stick to the original plan, and build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell?
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Make the decision.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Interesting. Since you've made up your mind, allow me to reveal what fate this choice will bring to the fledgling.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: From what I've observed, there are at least three predators in that yard that prey on small birds: The Vossickle Scorpion, Asdana Wolverine, and the Huntington Winged-Snake...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Even if they shy away from humans, these animals are still near-apex predators in a fenced location like a yard. In such a location, only one fate awaits that little Charmony Dove: A painful death.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: As for the choice you made... I am deeply sorry. Now, let us advance to the second decision. This time... it's the story of a Dreamchaser.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Think it over some more.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Choose "Nurture with care in a cage"
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Or build a cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home?
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Make the decision.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I'm happy to see that you made a choice similar to ours. If your mind is made up, let me reveal the outcome of this choice.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: We passionately nursed it back to health, preparing only the best food for it every day. We even preened its feathers. Later, on the day that Robin left Penacony, we opened the cage door and let it fly back into the sky.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I watched it for a long while by the window, probably about three or so days. In those three long days, the little Charmony Dove tried again and again to spread its wings to fly into the sky, but fell to the ground... only to keep trying.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Finally, on the hundred and thirty-seventh attempt, it succeeded. But its attempt did not go perfectly... After flying unsteadily for a while, it fell to the ground, unable to grasp the direction of the air currents.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: The fall shattered its wings. It writhed helplessly in my embrace, but it was all for naught, finally succumbing to a painful demise. And in that instant, our tender care, our given love and hopes... they all became the inevitable push that sent it to its death.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I deeply regret the choices we made... Next, let us head to the second decision. This time... it's the story of a Dreamchaser.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Think it over some more.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: This story happened when I was appointed as Bronze Melodia — a position exclusive to the Oak Family, charged with listening to the problems and vexations of Dreamscape residents, and providing them with the relevant guidance.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: It was during that period that I had the opportunity to hear voices from all corners of the Dreamscape: Joy, sorrow, arrogance, regret... The complex tapestry of human nature that formed the world, and I was fortunate to catch a glimpse of it.
[Beauty and Destruction][Media]: Trailblaze Mission The Only Path to Tomorrow.mp4
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: He was a Dreamchaser, and an illegal stowaway. Just like the rest of them, he came to Penacony in search of a better life, except that, to most people, the price he paid... I suppose you could say it was "everything".
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: He told me "I sold everything I could at home." — the house, the land, even his two children... He said he could not afford to raise them, and that at least they could eat if they lived as slaves.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: He had a plan in place: He would buy back his children once he had made his fortune, and enjoy Penacony's beautiful dream with them. Alas, his plan to smuggle himself was somewhat clumsy — and he was sniffed out by those pigheaded Hounds.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: After hearing the Dreamchaser's story, I immediately appealed to the Bloodhound Family to cease their pursuit. That way, at least he could live peacefully. But I was still too naive to the ways of the world — I did not anticipate that what I thought was a kind gesture would later lead to dire consequences...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I'll tell you the outcome soon. For now, I'd like you all to make a choice—
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Will you do as I did, and try to convince the Bloodhound Family to stop their pursuit, so that the Dreamchaser may live peacefully and realize his wishes?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Or will you remain silent, leaving him to languish while the Hounds are hot on his heels, until his inevitable judgment arrives?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I look forward to everyone's decisions. Who knows, perhaps they might even alter the outcome of this tragedy.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: It seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on Penacony... But that guy in the story, I don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: He sold his kids to chase a dream... Even if he intended to go back for them, it's still insanely irresponsible.
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: With that thought, there is only one choice: Let the Bloodhounds send him back home! This person deserves to be punished!
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: A Dreamchaser story... If I acted out of kindness, I would probably ask the Bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: But, what cruel repercussion would this choice result in? I think, Sunday must have been deeply impressed by the limitations of "the strong defending the weak" through this incident.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: This question... surely it has some connection to the baby bird story — and this connection is precisely the breakthrough Sunday aims to use to persuade us...
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: ...I'd probably choose to ask the Bloodhounds to cease their pursuit.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Choose "Convince the Bloodhound Family"
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Will you try to convince the Bloodhound Family to stop their pursuit, so that the Dreamchaser may live peacefully and realize his wishes?
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Make the decision.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I'm honored to witness you arriving at the same decision. Out of respect, I'll share with you the dire consequences that my choice back then brought about.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: First, the outcome: He attained major success. After avoiding capture, he ran a business for a few years, very quickly making a name for himself, elevating his status. He might not have become a tycoon like Old Oti, but he was considered a character of excellent repute.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Now then, did he realize the wish he set out to achieve? No. The last time I saw him was in the real world, where the Hounds were going to permanently exile him, and I was the accompanying Bronze Melodia. The mission was simple: Listen to the criminal's repentance.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: He told me the reason he was in this predicament was because he conspired to usurp the head of the Alfalfa Family. When I asked him about his two children, he instead responded with a question: "What children?"
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: In the end, my heart aligned with the Harmony, and the good deed I dared to undertake held no value, turning instead into a wrongdoing. It created a lamentable oppressor and countless oppressed individuals...
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Think it over some more.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Choose "Remain silent throughout"
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Or will you remain silent, leaving him to languish while the Hounds are hot on his heels, until his inevitable judgment arrives?
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Make the decision.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: It seems you, like me, are pondering whether a different choice could have led to a better outcome. Sadly, his fate would only be more tragic.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Say he never gets caught, he would only die from delirium. The methods with which illegal stowaways enter dreams are unorthodox, not flawless like the hotel's. Living in the Dreamscape would be a mere pipe dream.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Should he be apprehended, could the Hounds afford to turn a blind eye? The answer is a definitive no. They couldn't bear the resulting consequences, and thus, wouldn't dare extend a helping hand.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: Think it over some more.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: As to your choice, I once again offer my heartfelt apologies. Next comes the third and final decision—
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: And the story this time... is my own.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: This story happened the day I was appointed the Oak Family Head. At that time, Mr. Gopher Wood was the current Dreammaster, and as per his wish, we had a private conversation.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: What surprised me was that the Dreammaster had only come to deliver a letter to me. He let me read its contents. It was a letter... from my sister.
[Beauty and Destruction][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Beauty and Destruction.mp4
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: The letter contained the usual pleasantries, anecdotes from her travels — nothing out of the ordinary. Just as I started wondering how this letter related to our discussion, the Dreammaster began to speak.
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "Do you know who wrote this letter?"
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: "My sister, of course. But why would you personally visit me to hand me a letter from my sister containing mere trivialities?"
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "To help you grasp the full scope of this issue. Do you know where Robin is at this moment?"
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: "From what the letter indicates... She must be in Kasbelina-VIII, correct? She's touring there right now..."
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "Correct. Has she mentioned anything about a stray bullet?"
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: "A stray bullet? What..."
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "A war has broken out on that planet. It is because of this very reason that Robin chose this destination... To spread the word of the Harmony, and to save the lives of that planet, she personally made for the frontlines."
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "She hoped to ease the people's suffering with song, and was willing to brave mortal danger to deliver the IPC's medical supplies... Unfortunately, stray bullets show no such compassion."
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: "Is she alright!?"
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "If the operation was successful, she should probably be recovering in the field hospital."
[Beauty and Destruction][Narration]: "Dreammaster": "By the Aeon above, the bullet struck her neck directly... Yet, possibly as a reward for her consistent deeds of Harmony, it didn't hit any vital arteries. Once you've attended to your outstanding tasks, it'd be advisable to write her back as soon as possible."
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: "Those... damned savages! I'll pack my bags right away... My gratitude for bringing this to my attention, Mr. Gopher Wood!"
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Now, you understand why she always wears such elaborate neck ornaments, don't you?
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: How could this happen... Miss Robin...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: It's all in the past, so please don't worry. I share this in the meager hope that you will understand the Harmony's limitations and predicament. As grandiose as "the strong defending the weak" sounds, many times, it is nothing more than wishful thinking.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Likewise, I've prepared one last question, one last choice. But rest assured, this choice will not have any grave consequences.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Because this is merely a figment of imagination, a nightmare that has haunted me through countless nights. If you ever had the opportunity to make a choice like I did...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Would you still support Robin's journey on the Path of Harmony?
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: I can't believe that happened to Miss Robin... "The strong defending the weak" is a great mantra, but if I had to pay such a price... I, I don't know what I'd do...
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: I often feel like I've dreamt of similar scenes on certain nights. In the dream, I see blurry faces. I don't know who they are, but I sympathize with all of them, fighting for survival against some unfathomable force...
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: Their confusion and fear are lucid to me... But I also remember they chose never to give up — just like Miss Robin.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: , if Mr. Sunday's question leaves you puzzled, you should find the answer from your own experiences.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: With each Trailblaze, dangers and tribulations will surely follow, but would you ever back away? Would you stop March and Dan Heng from reaching their next destination? I believe you have an answer of your own in your heart.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: Miss Robin's courage is admirable. And here I was, thinking she was just another superstar celebrity...
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: But the fact that she's also Mr. Sunday's younger sister... No, I doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Heh... I see.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I am now aware of everyone's stances.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Raising these questions merely serves to illustrate one point: The plight of Penacony cannot be salvaged by the Harmony. The true foundation for a Sweetdream Paradise can only be established through the Order where the strong govern the weak.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: I know the suffering of being tormented, the turmoil of losing your way, how sorrow... and even despair, set in when matters don't work out. All of this causes me unending pain, because this is not what "happiness" is at all.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: We must teach the weak how to live a happy life. And this life isn't some noble propriety that the upper crust preaches, but in definitive terms, a way of survival that belongs to everyone.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: So, what is your definition of living a happy life?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Good question. Human consciousness is fundamentally an illusion, a cage known as "self-worth". People lured in by this illusion, make mistakes, yet still ask that external influences bear the burden.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: When one mistake after the next permeates the masses, they become impossible to trace... Thus, the amassing of these individual cages culminate to form a prison, a place dictated only by the rule of "survival of the fittest."
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Nature is always accompanied by predation and sacrifice... Its antithesis is known as Order.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: That is what I want to do: Unite people's happiness under the banner of Order. They won't need to make bitter choices any longer, nor face the weaknesses of humanity. They can cast aside their primal instincts, to build a haven for mankind.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Simply describing thoughts is far too abstract, so allow me to provide a simple example: As you all may know, there are societal norms like "weekends" and "long weekends" that exist on some worlds.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: During these hard-earned rest days, people are given the chance to extricate themselves from the stresses of everyday life, allowing a certain tranquility to return to their souls.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: And it is only on these days, that people do not have to adhere to the law where the strong prey on the weak — they can live out their lives happily during these brief intermissions. It's just a pity... that two or three days are still too fleeting compared to the span of a lifetime.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: From where I stand, society's ideal system should be "seven rest days". Following Sunday, there should ensue a second, a third, and indeed an infinite procession of Sundays. This should be the face of the new world — idyllic, eternal, peaceful days.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: And thus, every person can return to their base selves in this utopia. Some gaze in reverence at the stars, pouring their whole beings into calculating the distance between us and the isolated world of Pegana. Meanwhile, some seek refuge in quiet corners, holding one another, unencumbered by the chains of unwelcome obligations...
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: There would be no need to bear the hardships of reality. Only in this way can humanity face the inevitable end with the purest of spirit. Living a life of dignity — this is what it is to live in bliss.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Miss Firefly, you who are stricken with Entropy Loss Syndrome — you of all would surely understand this?
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: ...
[Beauty and Destruction][March 7th]: It sounds... like a flawless theory...
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: ...
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: But... what is the price to attain all this?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: The cost is minute, merely a personal... and eternal sacrifice. If this paradise is to be maintained for everyone, someone must remain trapped in solitary wakening, until the end of the cosmos.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: Wakening... Which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. Stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: It is not forsaking, but transcending. Flesh, blood, sorrow, weakness. If the physical is the root of spiritual suffering, it is only logical that we defeat it.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: But in this supposed "bliss," people won't have defeated their demons. The chance to overcome their tribulations would be forever lost to them. In other words... it is an escape.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: That's another way of understanding it, but there is no shame in escape. On the contrary, the seeds of escape exist in everyone's hearts.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: Don't you agree, Miss Firefly? And as to why we sleep? It is because we are afraid to awaken from our dreams.
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: But this is not in conflict with the grand plan. Only in acknowledging this, can we truly understand the frailty of human nature, and from there, show compassion and protection.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: I... admit that you are a born leader. Your perspective on humanity brims with pessimism, yet you express compassion for all, even when your heart pities them.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: But unlike you — I live for the "self". From my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: The want to escape may be innate in the weak, but whether they are weak or not... It is not up to another to decide.
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: Perhaps in your mind, you also view me as "weak"?
[Beauty and Destruction][Sunday]: ...
[Beauty and Destruction][Firefly]: Because I don't think so.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: Since Miss Firefly has said her piece, the Astral Express will also naturally give you our answer.
[Beauty and Destruction][Himeko]: We'll leave it to you, . Just as Mr. Mikhail instructed before: Tell him our choice...

[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Not long ago...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: What is this place...?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Does this place ring any bells, Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I... don't know, but I feel a sense of deja vu. What is this place?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: It's the realm within a dream bubble. This was left to the Astral Express by a Nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Dr. Edward from the Dreamscape Sales Store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: So I thought you might be able to help us in unraveling this mystery, Misha? As a hotel doorman, you know Penacony best among us.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Hmm, I don't know much about dream bubbles, but if you want to figure out what this mansion is... I'll do my best!
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: I'm counting on you then.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Himeko... I still don't get it. Why were you so sure that Misha had a connection with this dream bubble?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: I wasn't sure. It was just a hunch, but since Misha feels familiar with this place... my hunch might be correct.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: This place looks a bit familiar...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: This place feels a bit nostalgic...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Exactly, this is where you and Firefly encountered "Death," which we now know as "Dormancy." Considering its connection to Dreamflux Reef, it's not surprising it appeared here.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: The question now is — Who brought you here? Based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that Masked Fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: We're drawing closer to the truth once more. Let's give Misha some time, as I believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Alright, but there are doors all over the place... Which one should we choose...? Do you have any idea, Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Hmm... I guess... maybe this way?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I... I'm not entirely sure, but... let's give it a try.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Wait, you managed to choose the right door on your first try?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Weird, this place is quite different from the hotel, but I just... I feel like I've been here before and... even lived here for a while.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: If I remember correctly, there should be a fireplace down that hallway. Clockie and I used to sit by the fire, listening to the crackling of firewood.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: And... And the room on the other side was... the toy room. I loved spreading out all the toys from the box on the floor and making up stories for each of them.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Hold on, this doesn't make sense. Didn't I grow up in Dreamflux Reef? So, what is this place...?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: This could be a case of amnesia. But don't worry, Misha, it's common for everyone to forget certain aspects of the past. Those memories haven't vanished. They're just lying in the depths of your mind. We can surely get them back.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, then let's check out the rooms I just mentioned.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Mikhail, that's the name. Now we all know him as the Watchmaker.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: So, who is he talking to? Do you know anything about it, Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I'm sorry, I don't know much about the Watchmaker, but Mikhail...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Anything special about that name?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Mikhail... is Grandpa's name.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Grandpa? Do you mean... you're the Watchmaker's grandson?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: But we haven't heard anything about the Watchmaker having descendants, and the name "Mikhail" is not rare. Perhaps it's merely a coincidence.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Could you tell us more about your grandpa Mikhail?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, sure. He was a seafarer who fearlessly ventured into mysterious seas and storms. He was always on the sea and had a lot of friends who accompanied him on his travels.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He didn't want me to call him "Grandpa" because that would make him sound old. He believed he was still young. The name "Mikhail" was given to him by his parents, Mihaly and Elise, both renowned seafarers.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Every time he came back, he'd share his logbook with me and tell me about his adventures at sea. I want to become a great adventurer just like him.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: It appears that the seafarer has nothing to do with the Watchmaker. So, perhaps it's just a coincidence?
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: So, where is your grandpa now?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He went off on a new journey, and it's been quite a while since I last saw him.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: So, where has Clockie gone...? Did he leave to protect Dreamville?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I heard some noises from the room... Origami Bird? That's a friend of mine.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: You and Origami Bird are friends?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, it's a member of the Compass crew, just like Clockie and Miss Mirror. And there's more than just one Origami Bird! They are a big family with lots of brothers and sisters who look the same.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: They follow Miss Mirror's orders and handle all sorts of jobs on the ship. They're the best sailors.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Sailors? Can Origami Birds be sailors...?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Could you tell us more about the "Compass," Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: The "Compass" is a ship bound for the New World! Clockie and his partners travel through layers of fog to the depths of the sea. Whenever there is danger, Clockie will use a compass and guide the ship in the right direction!
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: That's a great story, but in the Penacony cartoon, Clockie and his partners have always lived in Dreamville and never ventured out, right?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Huh? Oh... that does seem to be the case.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Weird... I clearly remember... Clockie arrived in the New World in the end...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Perhaps Clockie has a hidden past.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I think I hear the sound of water...
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: once mentioned there's a magnificent fountain up ahead.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Look, there it is.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: "The water resembles a precious jewel, embedded in the dreams of all seafarers."
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: "Every time I gaze at the shimmering lights beneath the waves, it feels as though I'm back in this place, standing by your side..."
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Have you recalled anything, Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, I saw these sentences in Grandpa's logbook. He used to say that despite the perils of the sea, whenever he stood on the deck in the afternoon, overlooking the sparkling waves, he would think of this fountain in front of his house.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He often said that those moments felt like returning to his family's side, and the difficulties at sea didn't seem quite as challenging.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: *sigh* You know, I quite understand such sentiments...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Don't sigh, or you'll start getting gray hair...
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Hey, don't tease! I was just being a bit sentimental.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: You're talking like an elder.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: I'm not an elder. I was just being a bit sentimental.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Perhaps every adventurer far from home carries a fountain within their soul. Even though the other side of the sea remains shrouded in the unknown, the fountain in front of his house serves as a compass, leading him back to his cherished ones.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, while Grandpa was at home, we would stand by the fountain and place the "Compass" — a toy boat that I made — into the pool!
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Back then, I would ask him when I could go on adventures like him, and he would always laugh and say I was still too young.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: It seems this "Mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the Watchmaker.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Yeah, based on Misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: But this raises more questions. According to Misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to Penacony at all...
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Could this be some sort of metaphor? Perhaps the "sea" refers to the Memory Zone?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I'm sorry. I don't know, but my memories keep pouring out uncontrollably, like water flowing from a fountain...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Perhaps... I'll remember more things if we go further...
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: We're going to the opposite side, right?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: No, we should turn left here...
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Huh? Something feels different about this place?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: This is it. I remember this corridor.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Up ahead is... Grandpa's study. It was in that room that I saw him the last time.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: The atmosphere in this room feels totally different.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Misha! You've finally come!
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Clockie, you're here! Yeah, this is the room where we first met each other...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, whenever he came back, he'd place a logbook on the bookshelf in his room. They contain records of his expeditions to every corner of the world.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He described our world as a fountain. At some point, the sea started to gradually swallow up the land where people lived.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: To ensure that everyone had land to settle on, he had to continue exploring the sea and search for the source of the rising seawater.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: On that day, he called me to his study, telling me that he was embarking on another journey. However, I could sense the gravity in his expression. It was the same look I had seen on my father's face before his final voyage.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I asked him if I could go with him, but he said that my adventure lay elsewhere and told me to stay home and patiently await a certain sound at the door.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: What sound?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He told me about a vast ocean in the sky — an ocean of stars. He spoke of a train that transports children with a desire to venture far away, traversing the sea of stars without ever stopping.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He said that he knew the crew on the train, and that he had asked them to take me along. He said the journey I had always dreamed of... would start there.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: A train? Could it be...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: It's the Astral Express. I remember now, Grandpa's friends are a group of Nameless who came to this world to resolve a disaster caused by a star.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Then he gave his pocket watch to me. It was his cherished treasure, appearing in every one of his adventure tales. He explained that difficult times were ahead but assured me that the watch would guide me.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: He said, as long as I kept moving forward, I'd eventually reach my desired destination. And then, it was as if I heard...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: The distant sound of a train whistle, echoing throughout the room...
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Exactly, Misha! And then we followed that whistle, didn't we?
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yeah, I think I can still find the way we took back then.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: This is the Dream Jigsaw, right? So, we're supposed to find the exit? But where can we find the last piece...?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Do you remember, ? You said you obtained a mysterious shard when you stumbled into this place.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Hey, the shape seems to match. So, this shard is also connected to Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. Let's get to the other side and investigate.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Enter the Dreamscape
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: This is it. This... is my room of clocks.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: While I spent my time waiting for Grandpa to return from his voyage, Walder gave me this workshop, and it became my "secret base"...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Here, I learned how to repair clockwork and gears out of my fondness of precision mechanics. In my dreams, I was the captain of the "Compass," embarking on adventures with my companions, Clockie and Miss Mirror, in search of the New World.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I... I was born and raised here.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: So, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Yes, but not exactly. To be more precise...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: This "dream bubble" itself is my home.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Looks like you've remembered everything now.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Wait, wait! Why does it feel like everyone else knows something I don't?
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Yeah, you're the only one still in the dark.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Too bad I don't know either...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: March, do you remember when  mentioned a "Clockie" that only  could see?
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Yeah, the little guy here, right? But we all saw him in Dreamflux Reef, right? And Mr. Yang even greeted him.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Looks like everyone on the Astral Express has a childlike spirit!
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: The answer lies in the Astral Express. 's experience shows that neither Firefly nor Acheron can see this Clockie.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: And when we were in Dreamflux Reef, you may have noticed that for some reason, nobody outside of the Crew... had ever talked with Clockie.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Yeah, I noticed that, too.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Wait, really?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: A memetic life that can only be seen by a select few... It's just like a hidden message... left by someone for the Nameless.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: But Misha can see Clockie, too, right? They even grew up together, but Misha hasn't started the way of the Trailblaze yet...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: That's the key to the mystery, March. Now, take a moment to recall...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Have you ever seen anyone outside of the Crew interact with Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: ...
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Wait... no way...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: That's the answer, March 7th. This dream bubble is the place where I was born, and I... I'm a dweller in this dream just like a Memory Zone Meme.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I should have stayed here and waited for you, but when reality and memories merged, I unconsciously pushed open that door and left the bubble with Clockie.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: So, it's not that the Watchmaker's dream bubble is empty, but rather... the stuff inside ran away?
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: And the whistle you heard was the sound of the Express arriving at Penacony?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: That's one way to see it, but I believe there is a longer story behind all this. It's best for Misha himself to explain all the details...
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: How about we start with your name? Now, should we call you Misha? Or...
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: Thank you all for helping me rediscover my true self. Now, please allow me to reintroduce myself.
[Then Wake to Weep][Misha]: I was born on Lushaka in the Przesmir system, adopted by seafarers Mikhail and Char. They gave me a treasure, a name that carried their hopes...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Mikhail Char Legwork, or simply... Misha.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": If you prefer, you can call me by a more familiar name, the Watchmaker.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: So, you're the Watchmaker himself?
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": Unfortunately, that legendary figure is no more. I'm only a reflection of his life.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": As for the child who has been with you, he's the innocent protagonist of Misha's childhood dream, a friend of Clockie, a young apprentice, and a future mechanic on the Express...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": And this also marks the beginning of his journey devoted to the Trailblaze.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": At the end of the journey, I left this little flame, which I so cherished, in my deepest dreams, hoping to pass it on to the Nameless of future generations.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": However, he somehow left the dream bubble and forgot all about his task. I apologize for all the confusion this caused.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Because he was born with a desire to "trailblaze," wasn't he?
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: I don't think Misha has forgotten his role as a guide. He remembered it, and that's why he mistakenly appeared as a hotel doorman in 's dream from the very beginning.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: The one who brought our unconscious  here must have been Misha. If that's the case, we encountered the Watchmaker's Legacy from the beginning, didn't we?
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": Well, I have a sarcastic friend who says I always take big detours and end up back where I started... Perhaps that's what every Nameless has to go through.[Note 1]
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": But in the end, you've found me. I'm sure you're all wondering what my legacy is. I believe my hound has mentioned the Stellaron and my wealth...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": If I may apologize, the Stellaron part is real. As for my wealth, however, it's nothing more than a baseless rumor.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": I left my homeland as a child and embarked on the journey of Trailblaze. I traveled to various planets until finally reaching Asdana, where my friends and I built the original Penacony and fought for its future ever since...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": I've been moving forward all my life, doing what I could to overcome the obstacles in my path. But ultimately, my journey reached its end, and I left behind no possessions worth entrusting...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": So, if you ask what's left within this worn-out train engine that can be called a "legacy"... I suppose it's the things that are still burning in the engine's furnace.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": Now that you're well aware of the current situation of Penacony, I certainly hope that you'll help me get this world back on track. But I'll leave that decision to you, for the Path of Trailblaze is never paved by others.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": All I have for you is a story and two gifts...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": I want to give you my pocket watch. It has accompanied me throughout my long journey, guiding that naive child forward, and has been blessed with the presence of so many great people up to this day.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": And my hat, too. The one who navigated for me placed it on my head and planted a fanciful thought in my mind — the Trailblazing expedition will never end.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": Now, it's time for you to make your choice. Once you've made up your mind, open that door and enter the long dream of an old man.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "The Watchmaker": I'll be waiting for you at the end of this corridor of time.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: All right, everyone. Let's make a decision.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Although I don't think anyone will have any objections.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: I'll choose the Trailblaze.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Of course. We've come this far. Surely there's no other option than moving forward.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: In that case, it's unanimous.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: I want to witness the legacy.
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Of course. We've come this far. Surely there's no other option than moving forward.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: In that case, it's unanimous.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: I object!
[Then Wake to Weep][March 7th]: Come on... Stop joking at a moment like this. We've come this far. Surely there's no other option than moving forward.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: In that case, the vote stands at two to one.
[Then Wake to Weep][Himeko]: Then let's proceed together to the end of this dream... and tell Mikhail our decision.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: ...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: ...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Mikhail! Where are you going...?
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Seafarer" Mikhail: Someone has to step up and save Lushaka. So, why can't it be me, Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Please, don't go. And if you must, please take me with you... Don't leave me alone...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Seafarer" Mikhail: Even without me, you know how to proceed forward, brave Captain Misha. The "Compass" is waiting for you. Haven't you always wanted to be a better adventurer than me?
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Seafarer" Mikhail: Now go. Board that train and... start your journey.
[Then Wake to Weep][Navigator Falcon Amundsen]: Where are you going, Mikhail?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: I... I'm going to clean the floor in the Parlor Car! I've promised the conductor...
[Then Wake to Weep][Navigator Falcon Amundsen]: Wait, first tell me, did you fix this watch?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Um... yeah.
[Then Wake to Weep][Navigator Falcon Amundsen]: I know what it looked like before. Its chain was broken, the back case torn, and the marks on the dial all worn out... How did you manage to fix it?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Well... It's hard to explain, but I knew it could be fixed...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: It's the hands, Mr. Amundsen. Its hands were intact and pointing in the right direction, so I knew there would be a way to fix the rest.
[Then Wake to Weep][Navigator Falcon Amundsen]: ...
[Then Wake to Weep][Navigator Falcon Amundsen]: I see, you'll work with me from now on. Haven't you always wanted to tinker with this train? You're its mechanic now. As for the conductor, I'll do the talking.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: B—But I only know how to fix watches...
[Then Wake to Weep][Navigator Falcon Amundsen]: Don't worry, you've got what it takes. I'll teach you what you need to know.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Navigator" Granholm: Where are you going, Legwork? It's time to head to our next stop.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: ...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: I... I'm staying in Asdana, with Razalina and Tiernan.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Navigator" Granholm: I see... This place reminds you of home?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: The people of Asdana have only achieved a tiny victory and still have a long way to go... towards true freedom. Hanunue needs us.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Don't worry, not all journeys lead to the stars. Even if I leave the Express, our Path of Trailblaze will continue.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Navigator" Granholm: Yeah, I knew you wouldn't stay on the Express forever. Leave in peace, my friend, and take this with you.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: This is... Mr. Amundsen's hat? But why...?
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Navigator" Granholm: When he departed, he said he would leave it to his best student. Well, I suppose the time has come.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: "Navigator" Granholm: Farewell, Legwork. Take care of Tiernan and Razalina, and don't forget to... write to us.
[Then Wake to Weep][Micah]: Where are you going, Watchmaker?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Don't worry, Micah. Just going on a little trip.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Someone has to be at the forefront of the interstellar frontier, and I'm the only former Nameless in Penacony. So, why can't it be me?
[Then Wake to Weep][Micah]: Because you're all we have! Have you forgotten about Tiernan? The Cosmos is way more dangerous now! What will happen to Penacony if we lose you, too?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: But what will happen to Penacony if we don't find a way out?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Tiernan... How could I ever forget him? I've spent countless sleepless nights asking myself why I didn't go with him back then.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: We Nameless won't stop... Don't worry, Micah, it's just a matter of getting back to my old profession. Just wait for me to come back. But if, and it's a big if...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: If I don't come back in one piece, then you'll become the next Watchmaker.
[Then Wake to Weep][Gallagher]: Where are you going, old man?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Oh, you're here.
[Then Wake to Weep][Gallagher]: Answer my question. What are you up to?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Relax, Gallagher. I just came up with a great idea. Wanna hear it?
[Then Wake to Weep][Gallagher]: Oh, come on! Aren't all your "ideas" just ways to get yourself killed? I may be blunt here, but you're the last remaining hero in Penacony.
[Then Wake to Weep][Gallagher]: If you die too, the secret of the Stellaron... will go to the grave with you.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Yes, I'm afraid there's no way out in Penacony, so I'll have to consider alternatives beyond Asdana.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: We'll organize a festival, using the "Watchmaker's Legacy" as a facade... and send invitations to the entire Cosmos to gather people here.
[Then Wake to Weep][Gallagher]: So? A desperate struggle against The Family?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Desperate? Hah, don't we have you here, my friend? This task is challenging, but what hasn't been challenging for us along the way? Well, whatever you do, remember...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Make sure to send an invitation to the Astral Express.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Misha! Where are you going?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Oh, it's you, Clockie... Take me to Dreamflux Reef...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Last night, I had a long dream about the day we met. I want to write down that dream.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Write it down... Why?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: So I won't forget it. Do you remember how you got your name, Clockie?
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Of course! You told me that when you were a kid, you lived in a room full of clocks. Those wall clocks and pocket watches grew up with you and were your best friends!
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Yes, but what I didn't mention was... there's a funny misunderstanding behind it.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: I was a kid, and there was always a special pocket watch in my memories. It was with my grandpa, guiding him on his sea voyages and leading the way in his every adventure story.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: I wanted to have a pocket watch like that too, and that's when you appeared in my dreams.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Yeah, every night we boarded the Compass and set sail together!
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: But you know what? It wasn't until the day my grandpa gave it to me that I realized... it wasn't a pocket watch at all...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: It was a compass.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: So, your name should have been "Compassie"...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: And the Watchmaker... is just a Nameless.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: ...
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: We've arrived at Dreamflux Reef. So, where to next?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: You know, Clockie. I don't think... I'll be going anywhere else.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: Rest under the moonlight
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: I've traveled far enough, and it's time for a little break...
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Oh, so we'll set out again when you're rested?
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: No, I'll stay here, and then... this is where it ends.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: This is where it ends? What do you mean, Misha?
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: You told me that the Trailblazing expedition would never end.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Yeah, that's what I said...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: So now, it's up to you to decide your next destination.
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: My next destination? What's that supposed to be? I've been following you...
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Misha? You're acting weird today! If you're feeling down, we can just do what we usually do... with the clockwork!
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: No, I'm not feeling down. As for clockwork... yeah, it resolves all problems in this dream.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: So, do you know what clockwork actually is?
[Then Wake to Weep][Clockie]: Hmm? I'm not quite sure.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Well, everyone gets lost at times. They may hesitate and doubt which way to go. That happens in this Dreamscape and beyond.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: But don't worry, everyone goes through moments of uncertainty and hesitation. Eventually, they gather the courage to make bold decisions...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Whether it's calming, happy, angry, or sad, all they need is a little nudge to take that step toward where they truly belong.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: I'm leaving that little nudge with you, and I hope you'll share it with others...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Such is the essence of clockwork, the will of the Trailblaze.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: Clockie's hands spin around non-stop, indicating confusion, frustration, and weakness.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: But ultimately, people still need to move forward,
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: just like your hands, always pointing ahead.
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: This is where my journey ends. From now own...
[Then Wake to Weep][Mikhail Char Legwork]: it is your path to walk.
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: : "Trailblazing,"
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: : means taking paths your predecessors foreswore,
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: : and venturing even further...
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: : The Penacony in Mikhail's dreams,
[Then Wake to Weep][Narration]: : does not belong to "Order."

[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: I can't believe that Aeon would cast a glance at Penacony at a time like this... Is it because of the resonance from the legacy of the Trailblaze? Or perhaps the bond between you is so strong that it even impresses an Aeon?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Well, there might be another possibility. Perhaps THEY want to witness, on behalf of the fallen Aeons, who will hold the future of Penacony.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: If that's the case, on behalf of the Dreammaster of Penacony and the 107,336 members of the Oak Family, I'm extending a formal invitation to all of you...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: I'm cordially inviting you all to the Penacony Grand Theater to participate in the upcoming Charmony Festival. And of course, you won't be in the audience, but on center stage.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Since the future of the Stellaron, Penacony, and even the entire Cosmos is at stake, let's draw a conclusion there, in all fairness.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: If you truly believe in Akivili's path, then show me THEIR courage and determination.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Does that mean he wants to fight us during the Charmony Festival?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: I'm afraid so.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: This is weird! Aren't arch villains usually plotting some dirty conspiracy in the end? But he actually said something like "in all fairness"... Could it be that he's underestimating us?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Well, in my opinion, Sunday is deeply committed to his own philosophy and genuinely wants to prove that the Order is right.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: I sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. Maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: That's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: We won't back down either.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Yeah, you're right! We've even dealt with a Lord Ravager of the Destruction, so a follower of the Order won't be a big deal!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: But he's such a gentleman. If evil, why so nice?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: A—Are you backing out now!? We've even dealt with a Lord Ravager of the Destruction, so a follower of the Order won't be a big deal!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: I flexed too hard with my swag. Guess I now have to pay my dues, huh...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: You...! Every time an important moment arrives, you hesitate.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: We've even dealt with a Lord Ravager of the Destruction, so a follower of the Order won't be a big deal!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Anyway, we can't leave the Stellaron unchecked. This is about trailblazing a bright future for Penacony and fulfilling Mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: However, the same applies to the Order. Their plan didn't materialize overnight, and they have the profound collective consciousness of the Planet of Festivities behind them...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: A desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality... All those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the Order.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: They've harnessed the will of an entire planet to create an Aeon... This confrontation is far more complicated than a simple power struggle. To secure Penacony's future, fighting on the stage alone is not enough.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: What do you mean? Are you not coming with us...?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: I believe Firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Mhmm.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: ...Before I left, Destiny's Slave told me that this journey would bring unforgettable rewards. Even though the script he gave me only had a few lines, I couldn't ignore them.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Because one of the lines said... I'll experience "death" three times in the land of the dreams.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Three times!? This can't be serious, right...?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: The first time was a painful death when I was stabbed by the blade of "Dormancy," which led to all subsequent events. The script will always come true, but in a way... that will only be revealed when that page is turned.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: So now, I've understood the meaning of my second "death," and I am prepared to face it. If all goes well, my efforts will provide crucial support for you.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Only by achieving victory in this battle can we secure a future for Penacony. And only then, my third and final death... won't come true in the most terrible form.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: The most terrible form? Does that mean...?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: The true "death"... where everyone in Penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the Order.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: We must do everything we can to prevent that.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Have you... made up your mind, Firefly?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Yes, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Thank you again for your assistance for the Astral Express. May we meet again in reality.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Yeah, farewell, everyone. May your Trailblazing expedition never end.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: I dreamed of a scorched earth.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Everyone, are you ready?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: A new shoot sprouted from the earth.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: It bloomed in the morning sun,
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: and whispered to me...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Like fireflies to a flame... life begets death.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: May we meet again in reality.

[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Blade]: After today, Jepella's name will disappear from cosmic history, and the Ever-Flame Mansion will take its place. In the not-too-distant future, you'll receive an invitation...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Blade]: That's your next stop.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Land of the Dreams, Penacony.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Blade]: I hope you find whatever you seek there, be it answers... or salvation.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: You mean... my three "deaths"?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Blade]: Silver Wolf told me about it. It's such a shame that it's not part of my script.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: While I want to live, I'm never afraid of death. The opposite of death is eternal life, and that's... that's something I'll never desire.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: People die, and I am no exception. Death is like a script, a fate that cannot be defied. But that's exactly why...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: We have to choose where we want to rest forever.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Blade]: Do you exist just to perish?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Are you not the same, Blade? The end you desire is not one dictated by others.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: If I were to die now, I would only be a weapon. I believe... I should die as a human.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: Though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? A name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: The tombstone that belongs to me once bore the inscription "Glamoth's Iron Cavalry," then it changed to "Stellaron Hunter," but one day...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Firefly]: It will bear the name "Firefly" and the brilliance she showed at the end of her life.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: In the meantime... somewhere at Dreamflux Reef...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: That's quite unexpected, old man. Who would've thought your crazy plan would actually work? Do all you Nameless fools just act on a whim?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: I can sense that this false sweet dream is coming to an end. The Nameless may be young, but they had the ability to achieve this goal... just like you did in your time.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: It's a shame you won't be able to see it firsthand. Heh, maybe I won't either... Once something fictional is seen through, it ceases to exist.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: Yeah, not just those Nameless, even Mr. Wings is just like you... Stubborn, won't listen or give up, no matter what... Well, fate is unpredictable, I guess. If we weren't bound by those cursed Paths, maybe we could've had some good talks.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: But in the end, we managed to do it, and now we can find solace. Remember how those idiots cursed us? They said, "Go to hell, you worthless traitors!" Heh...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: Well, I don't know if they really meant it, but if longing for freedom means going to hell...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: Then I'll be joining you soon, you old fool.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: Let's get together and have supper again in hell...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: Oh, I almost forgot. There's one more thing...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: Here's to you, a glass of "Hello and Goodbye"... ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Gallagher]: To the imperfect... tomorrow.

[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: It's warm here, isn't it? You're lucky to have found shelter from the rain, let alone fresh berries, in this desolate place.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: I was just following the scent of life. It's particularly strong in a place like this.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: It's a shame these berries don't have much flavor.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Seriously? In case you didn't know, this fruit is pretty juicy. The only downside is that when you chew it...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: ...It becomes extremely spicy.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Have you... lost your sense of taste?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: I can still taste certain things... like a faint sweetness.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: Before coming here, I stopped by a place called Orkron. It had barren cliffs and nights lit by bonfires. Burgundy snow would fall from the sky, and when it landed on my tongue... it tasted like raspberries.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: The flavor wasn't exactly sweet, but it left a lasting impression. When I think back on my past, I realize that what's tying everything together... isn't the big events, but rather these small yet unforgettable moments.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: Don't worry about it. Losing oneself is a reality that every Self-Annihilator must face. At least, I haven't completely lost my senses and memories yet.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Well, congratulations on adding another footnote to your journey.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: By the way, are you always alone?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: No, I had a companion in Orkron. She's a short Nameless girl who aspired to explore IX... She always said she'd walk a path "deeper and farther than Akivili's."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Quite an ambition for such a small girl... So, what happened?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: She... became stagnant water.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Well... my condolences.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: Condolences? I don't need them. The girl left with a smile. She never regretted her choice and most definitely wanted me to say goodbye with a smile... So that's what I did.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: That's proof that you're grieving for her.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: Or perhaps I'm just afraid?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Afraid? I rarely sense that emotion from you. What do you fear?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: I'm afraid I'll forget the thirty days I spent with her, just like all the other days in my life. Most of them have already washed away with the rain, disappearing into an unseen realm.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: I fear that those vivid red memories will fade away too. There isn't much color left, and besides this faint, warm red, there's almost nothing.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Hard to imagine... a "Ranger" accustomed to bloodshed, destruction, and chaos finding warmth in the red color.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: Because I have experienced this warmth many times. Long ago, I promised someone that I'd bring it to more people, and that for every remaining moment of my life, I'd strive for... a better ending for all.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: As long as this red color still lingers, I have a chance to fulfill that promise. It represents a burning fire, a blooming flower, the berries in this cave... and life itself, fleeting yet still dazzling.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: In the end, it will lead me beyond the Horizon of Existence, and on the other side, I will... cut off Nihility.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: The one blessed by the sleeping and shapeless is considering how to kill THEM? That's truly... pure Nihility.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: But you're right about one thing — After spending so much time near this stagnant water, only when I look at this vibrant red fire do I realize that I'm still alive.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: When will this rain... ever stop?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: Perhaps... when the sorrows of the departed have finally quieted down, the sky will clear up.

[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Black Swan]: Have you heard of a planet named Byari Skamandros, Dan Heng? It's one of the paradises under the influence of the Harmony, a sought-after wonderland for the inhabitants of the Dardanu Major and Minor systems.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Black Swan]: Half an Amber Era ago, The Family held an unprecedented festival there, and after that... everyone on the planet became part of The Family.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: Do you think the same thing will happen on Penacony?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Black Swan]: Yes, or how else can we explain it? The Family deliberately used the Watchmaker's invitation to keep all the Pathstriders here but banished the Emanator of the Nihility...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: Because of the Nihility, I'm rarely affected by the power of other Paths, but somehow I can unconsciously infiltrate them... Maybe that's the "risk" they're trying to avoid.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: I would disagree. Byari Skamandros is not part of the credit system or connected to the silver rail. It's nothing more than a remote civilization sheltered by the Harmony... But Penacony is different.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: If The Family messes with Penacony, that would be like declaring war on almost half of the factions in the Cosmos. They have no reason to do that.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: No, they don't... if they truly serve the Harmony, that is.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: What do you mean?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: The Path in Penacony is impure. The Harmony here has impurities.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Black Swan]: Do you remember the ancient Swarm Disaster? Tayzzyronth the Propagation brought endless havoc to the universe, and it eventually evolved into a fierce battle among all Aeons.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Black Swan]: Two Paths lost their Aeons in that war — the Propagation and the Order. Coincidentally, their downfall is related to a certain Aeon...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: ...Xipe the Harmony. Legend has it that THEY participated in the crusade against the Imperator Insectorum and devoured Ena the Order for unknown reasons.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Boothill]: Holy forkeroni... So, you're saying that the two leaderless Paths are working behind the scenes?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: But I don't see any descendants of the Propagation in Penacony. Could it be that the remnants of Beyond the Sky Choir are hiding within The Family, trying to resurrect a fallen Aeon?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: I can't say for sure, but they're definitely planning something for the Charmony Festival.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Boothill]: Holy Wubbaboo! This is getting way too complicated. Is this why you want us to leave Asdana right away? Are you giving up?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Acheron]: The Charmony Festival will start soon. There's one thing that... I need to confirm no matter what. A warp jump is the best way to do so.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: Time is running out...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: I have another plan.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Boothill]: Hold on, are you thinking of using the Jade Abacus of Allying Oath?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: Exactly. The assistance from the Luofu Cloud Knights... would be enough.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Boothill]: Think it over carefully. You can only use that once in your lifetime.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Dan Heng]: I have considered it thoroughly. My companions are... They're also once-in-a-lifetime treasures.

[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Are you the only one here, my child?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": The Nameless is quite the diplomat.[Note 1] Our secrets have spread like wildfire within The Family, and IPC starships are gathering towards Asdana...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": This is a crucial moment for us. So, where is the chosen one who harmonizes the varied sounds?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: What do you mean, Master?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: I'm right here in front of you, aren't I?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": You know, she was supposed to be the star of the Charmony Festival in our plan.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: But the plan has changed. As her brother, I know she doesn't want to sing for the Order, so I'll take her place.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Heh, you've always been wise beyond your years. I'm sure you understand the consequences of your choice.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: If you consider this a betrayal...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Well, there can't be two suns in the sky. I'll step up and take down the other sun if necessary.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Do you believe in karma?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: If karma exists, then everyone has their own karma. You have yours, and I have mine.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: And my karma has nothing to do with you, Mr. Gopher Wood.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Alright, since you're willing to sacrifice yourself for her, I'll grant your wish.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Well, the compromise came sooner than expected. Why?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": You and your sister were born as twins of the Order, and one of you is destined to follow this path to the end.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Is this part of your plan?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Of course. You're still as clever as you were when you were a child.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": The opening is near. Go, my child. Seize the power of the Harmony and reveal your karma.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: I have one final question, Master.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Why did you choose to bring the Order to Penacony? Wouldn't it have been better to choose a desperate world instead of a city filled with hope and dreams? Why?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": It's for justice, my child.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": If we lose justice in our hearts, we'll make the same mistake as the Harmony did.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: So, it's not you who manipulates the Dreamscape with the Stellaron, but...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Dreammaster": Well, that's where our conversation ends. Go ahead. The 107,336 souls of the Oak Family have dreamed of this moment too many times...

[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: It's quite exhilarating to be flushed into the air by SoulGlad, but... why is the venue still closed when the Charmony Festival is about to start?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: And not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. No audience, no staff, no one around...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Are we too late?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Looks like the Charmony Festival was a flop at the box office!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Yeah, I wonder how many tickets... Hey, that's not what we should be concerned about!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Let's explore around. Be careful, everyone.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Gosh, the atmosphere here is so creepy and unsettling...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Even if there's no audience yet, there should be some staff around. Why is it so silent...?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Yikes! They scared the life out of me! Why are there so many... puppets at the ticket office?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: They won't suddenly start moving, will they?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Aaah! Stop it!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: So many mannequins! Is this a fashion store or something?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Can't believe you're in the mood to crack jokes...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: M—March... b—behind you...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Wh—What...? Ah! You're so annoying! Stop scaring me!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Are these puppets part of the stage setup? Even so, it's so eerie that the entire front hall is empty.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: I'm seriously scared they might start moving... Let's just leave, please!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Something feels off... We're in the right place, right?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: There's no other Grand Theater in the Dreamscape.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: So, Sunday is messing with us? He said we'd have a final showdown on the stage, but why is there no one here?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "My apologies for the delay, March 7th."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: You scared me! Wh—Where... are you now?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "I'm waiting for you behind the curtain. Following the Asdana tradition, I invite you to enjoy a stage play in three acts before the Festival begins."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "History is a mirror reflecting the universe's true essence. Let's use this opportunity to delve into the rich history of Penacony and the Aeons."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Within it, naturally, the future takes shape."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "Let us commence with the dawning of the world..."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "After the Dusk Wars, darkness veiled the sky, and chaos consumed the earth."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "Ena the Order emerged, destined to restore all existence."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "That marked the first day."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "THEY gathered nebulae and forged them into picks, thus creating a grand lyre with black and white keys."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "Strike the white keys, and the sun rose. Strike the black keys, and the moon rose."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "And so, the cycle of day and night arose. That marked the second day."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: The puppets are gathering around the frame. Are they expecting us to enter it?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Stage Play Act I]: Ode to Prisoner
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Where are we now?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: The atmosphere here... looks similar to Sunday's inner world. Perhaps this so-called "stage play" is created with his abilities.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: This act is named Ode to Prisoner. Given the atmosphere here... I believe it's about Penacony's past.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: I thought things were finally looking up as I managed to dodge prison during my recent trailblazing expeditions! But now it looks like I'll be back behind bars again...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "I genuinely wish to avoid a violent clash with my esteemed guests from afar. Therefore, I've arranged three acts before the situation becomes irreparable."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Where shall we start our narrative? Well, let's start with the time when Penacony was still a frontier prison."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "In 2147 AE, a prisoner named Hanunue ignited a struggle for liberty and emerged triumphant. IPC referred to it as the 'War of the Frontier', while the Asdanians dubbed it the 'War of Independence'."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "It's true that Hanunue was a legendary hero, but it must be acknowledged that while he bestowed freedom upon the prisoners, he didn't grant them true liberation."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "The three Nameless stayed on the planet, endeavoring to spread the tenets of Trailblaze throughout the frontier prison. Alas, their efforts proved futile."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Once again, Asdana was engulfed in war, this time the enemies originating from within. The prisoners remained prisoners for the rest of their lives, fighting for freedom rather than living for it."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Past's Voice": "I hope you like this land of freedom... on a scorched earth."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "As you can see, their sentences have long ended, and the IPC guards have long been expelled. Yet, these prisoners remain enslaved, not by external forces, but by the confines of their own minds."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Freedom permeates every corner except fragile souls. It gives solace only to those who believe in its existence."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Past's Voice": "Prisoners! This is my order! Learn the essence of freedom and teach your fellow prisoners to fight for their lives!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Hey, why do we have to fight while enjoying the show?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "For I desire not only your enjoyment but also your... assistance in its completion."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Past's Voice": "No one can restrain you any more! You are free!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Thus concludes the first act. Amidst a raging war, the frontier prison headed toward becoming Land of the Exiles."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: This must be how Penacony was constructed. With the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the Land of the Exiles.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: However, it appears that Sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand... Anyway, we've arrived at the exit. Let's go!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: These puppets... Where are they guiding us this time?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "THEY transmuted streams of stars into inked nibs, creating symbols to be pronounced and counted."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "THEY molded stardust into flowing rivers, assigning the righteous upstream and the unjust downstream."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Thus, all things were marked, and the world learned to discern between good and evil."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "That marked the third and fourth days."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Look, another frame...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Stage Play Act II]: Ode to Fool
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Ode to Fool... This must be the second act.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: The surroundings are different from before. The stage decorations... look a bit tidier now?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Behold the ensuing tale, a struggle for power. Penacony witnessed the ascent of the seven major lineages — Tree, Grass, Flower, Bird, Beast, Fruit, and Insect."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Peace never truly graced land of the exiles. The history in this era is rich and intricate, so please allow me to present it in allegorical form."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Land of the exiles was in disarray, besieged by both internal and external perils. Though the seven major lineages appeared united on the surface, each harbored their own ambitions, leading to ceaseless conflict."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "The Blackplum Family was the first to fall. They withered away in the White Desert event orchestrated by the Alfalfa Family."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "The leader of the Alfalfa Family sought to defect to the IPC, trading freedom for survival. However, his eldest son slew him in the name of righteousness and ascended as the new family head."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "The Lampmoth Family endeavored to extend the silver rail left by the Express, only to be eradicated by the remnants of the Swarm, leaving nothing in the unforgiving Cosmos."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Only when Gopher Wood led The Family to land of the exiles and earned recognition from all five major lineages did Penacony earn its new name, the Land of the Dreams."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][New Master]: "Dear outsider, I beseech your aid in purging this mansion of the poison spread by the lurking instigators."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Uh... You want us to help you? What do you need?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][New Master]: "I wish they could regain their reason and cast away the shackles of hypocrisy."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: This is the second act. Looks like it's about Penacony's journey to becoming the Land of the Dreams, during which The Family plays a crucial role.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: But this New Master... seems like a bad guy to me, don't you think?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Perhaps this is the truth Sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. The Harmony changed Penacony just as the guards once did.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Looks like we've got to help those guys kneeling down over there calm down a bit, right?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][New Master]: "Where are you headed, dear outsider?"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Guess we won't be able to leave until this act is complete.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: This puppet isn't responding at all... Did something go wrong?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Artist]: "In the absence of my master I am free, but without their guidance, for whom shall I sing?"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "The decaying human heart finds rebirth only with the calmness," proclaimed the new master.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Leave.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Artist]: "I shall sing for my new master, just as THEIR noble voice once resonated throughout the Cosmos."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Accountant]: "Master! Hope you will return in due course! And I shall stand vigilant, awaiting the reward for my loyalty!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Only reason can shield people from the lingering poison of the past," proclaimed the new master.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Leave.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Accountant]: "Master, now that you have gone, I shall wait no longer for my reward... I shall seize what is rightfully mine."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Retainer]: "Once, I stood as the most loyal guard among all the servants! Now, with my master banished, it's my right to assume control of his dominion!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "In the absence of calmness, there exists no path to liberation from the clutches of death," proclaimed the new master.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Leave.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Retainer]: "My former master has long departed, but why do I still fear the remnants of his creation?"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Advisor]: "Master is no longer here. I thought I'd be free, but I'm not. Now without my master's command, I'll have to seek guidance from the blind."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Only the calmed ones cane evade the insidious influence of the hidden instigator," proclaimed the new master.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Leave.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Advisor]: "Master is no longer here. I must seek a new master and serve them faithfully."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Butler]: "Either I shall be my own master, or I shall return to my former master! I shall not submit to a new master under any circumstances!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "I wish they could regain their reason and cast away the shackles of hypocrisy," proclaimed the new master.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Activate Clockwork
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Leave.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Butler]: "Without a master, who can grant me true freedom?"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][New Master]: "Thank you, dear outsiders! My servants have regained their sanity."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][New Master]: "Heed me, one and all! Your former master shall not return! It is through righteousness and unwavering support for one another that we shall attain true perfection!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][New Master]: "Cast aside the veils of hypocrisy! And embrace one another!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Get ready. Looks like another fight is about to begin...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Is this what they call "immersive theater"?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Present's Voice": Listen, snow blankets all of Asdana! The sky trembles, and the earth teeters on the brink of collapse. At the edge of the silver universe, the first buds sprout under the rising sun!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Alas, they remain but slaves till the very end, with the illusion of freedom."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Thus concludes the second act. Amidst an illusory harmony, Land of the Exiles charted its course toward becoming the Planet of Festivities."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: This is how Penacony fell under The Family's control. Since the arrival of the Harmony, the land of the exiles has undergone dramatic changes, not all of which have proven... beneficial.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: This guy really loves dramatic scenes. Bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "THEY used the planetary rings to establish the law, forging a code of conduct among the masses."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "A grand lyre with black and white keys served as an instrument, while symbols of articulation and numerical notation took the form of musical notes. The downward-flowing river became a melody, and the canon of law dictated the form."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "Thus, all mortals found their unique place within this symphony. That marked the fifth and sixth days."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: This guy is really into these puppets.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Stage Play Act III]: Ode to Order
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Oh, I get it now. The last scene is all about singing the praises of the Order.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: And the atmosphere here... is completely different from the previous two scenes.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "This is the concluding act of this play. I have showcased the past and present of Penacony, hoping that my desire for change resonates within you."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "And now, I shall reveal its future to you."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Chancellor]: "If the people lack foresight, we will make choices on their behalf and bear the responsibility."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Chancellor]: "We shall support one another, protecting the weak and standing against the mighty."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Chancellor]: "Before the arrival of a king, everything followed its natural course, and so it shall continue even after the king's departure."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Chancellor]: "We no longer have need for a king, for we have become kings of all things."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Hey? Aren't we supposed to kick off a short story and have a fight here just like we did in the previous acts? Why aren't any of these puppets saying anything?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: So... ? Do you think their mind needs tinkering or something?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Guess we won't be able to leave until this act is complete.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Farewell, former king."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "We no longer have need for a king, for we have become kings of all things."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: How did it go?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: I can't change the emotions...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: You can't change them? What does that mean...?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: "My apologies for my negligence. I forgot to inform you that the final part... was scripted long ago."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Future's Voice": "Let our previous king recount it to you. Now, it is time for the final rite."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Prepare for battle. Looks like we'll have to fight again.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Sovereign": "Descending from the infinite spiral staircase, I traverse towards the future with measured steps. No need to remember me or seek my existence, for the contours of my mind shall intersect with other experiences."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Sovereign": "In the hushed expanse of a nocturnal reverie, I leave faint traces behind. No need to remember me or to recall the essence of dreams."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Sovereign": "What is mine shall wane, while you shall transcend its delicate nature."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: This is the final scene — it's much more straightforward... He wants to expel the Harmony and establish an empire based on the Order.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Let's go. Once this stage play concludes... it'll be time for the main event — the Charmony Festival.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: 1 system hour until Charmony Festival
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "THEY imbued the world with meaning, perfecting all things in the heavens and on earth. Then, THEY rested from the labors of creation."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "Yet, all beings cried out to Ena — 'Under the banner of the Order, you have defined all things in the Cosmos... but this made us realize that we are but puppets in your hands!"
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "Thus, on that day, all beings united and cast the Aeon into the abyss of oblivion."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: This Grand Theater looks totally different... Is this the power of the Order?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Everyone, get ready. This could be a tough battle.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "That marked the seventh day."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][???]: "Cheers and chants reverberated in unison..."
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Step Description2]: 1 THEY gave "meaning to all in existence and all of heaven and earth were made perfect. Hence, THEY rested from THEIR work of creation.2:2 However, the masses cried out once more to Ena that the blood of the great Aeon must be spilt.2:3 You use "the Order" to define all of creation, yet you make us aware that we are naught more than your puppets.2:4 It was on that day that all of creation united as one, and cast the divine into the pit of destruction.2:5 This is how it came to pass. This was the seventh day.2:6 All of existence exclaimed out in joy and their voices of celebration shook the very earth. In that moment, the stars sang in great unison."The world is in harmony, the stars shine together, praise be to the Great One!""The Order is dead! The Order is dead! The Order is dead!" Penacony Grand Theater
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: Look! There he is!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: That concludes everything related to the Order. What are your reflections on this, my dear guests?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Nevertheless, this is but a trivial blip in the annals of galactic history. What truly matters is the course this river shall take in the days to come...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: You've arrived at the perfect moment. The Charmony Festival is about to commence, and it would be a shame if you were absent for the Harmony's prologue.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Allow me to extend my warmest welcome once more. Welcome to Penacony Theater, the very core of the sweet dream, the abode of the Stellaron, the grand stage of the Charmony Festival...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: And... the very place where the future of Penacony shall be determined through conflict.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: And the very place where your schemes get smashed to smithereens.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Your unwavering faith in the Trailblaze is truly impressive.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Why did you invite us to this duel?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Because our shared goals give equal weight to the beliefs we strive for.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: Where is the Stellaron? Why am I not seeing it?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: It hides behind the curtain. Or rather, it is the theater itself.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: However, if you want to see it, you must display faith equal to its immense power.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: True goodness can only be achieved through faith.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: Allow me to point out that falling into a permanent slumber is not happiness, especially when those people are driven by someone else's will in their sleep.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Do you still believe that the Order only seeks to control the universe as THEIR puppet, Himeko?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: No matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: People will never achieve true happiness in a world like that! They would just be toys for the Aeon!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: ...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: It seems you have misunderstood my intentions. Allow me to clarify — My desire is not to resurrect a fallen Aeon or become one myself...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: My sole objective is to create a paradise free from Aeons, where the Order ensures the dignity and happiness of all humanity. A paradise exclusive to us human beings.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: That's not the case. If people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: In your so-called paradise, you would be the one reigning supreme.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Looks like we won't be able to convince each other. Now that our conflict has been destined, let's unveil our Paths and reveal to the universe the true path.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: However, before the prelude to the future begins, please take a moment to ponder the questions I've posed...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Is darkness equal to daylight?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Are sinners equal to the righteous?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: If you are born weak,
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: which god should you turn to for solace?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Past": How tragic! The Aeon with great might...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Present": Under the banner of the Order, you have defined all things in the Cosmos...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Future": ...But this made us realize that we are but puppets in your hand!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Past and Present": The world is in Harmony!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Past, Present and Future": Praise the Great One!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: I already know your decision.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: I, now, permit you to gaze into the sun.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: On these one hundred and seven thousand, three hundred and thirty-six stones,
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: the almighty and powerful strings of Harmony are at my disposal...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: ...the supreme tuner,
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Sunday]: Harmonious Choir, Dominicus!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: O, lost souls! Come and meet your master!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: The embodiment of the Harmony? So, the true purpose of the Charmony Festival... is to usurp it?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: Wise and perceptive as you are... Answer me this — Why could the Harmony and the Order merge into one?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][March 7th]: I'm feeling like... there's another world in front of my eyes...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko]: It's the power of tuning... Don't let the song distract you!
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: Because neither side could tolerate... discord.
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: The time has come. Creation will be reborn from the remains of gods...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Himeko and March 7th]: Dan Heng?
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Jing Yuan]: Radiant spirit...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Jing Yuan]: Heed my word...
[Everything that Rises Must Converge][Jing Yuan]: ...Show no mercy!

[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Wake up... Wake up...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: ...Hey, ! Wake up! The sun's frying your butt!
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Are you all right? Can you hear me? Do you remember your name?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I... don't remember anything.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Not good. Try to remember. Your name is...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Alright, alright, stop joking around. The Lightning-Lord may be all-powerful, but they're not going to cause sudden memory loss. I'm just glad you're okay.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What happened while I was out?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Are we in the dream or reality?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Why does that line sound so familiar...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Hmm? It does? Well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details... Well that's reassuring.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What happened while I was out?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Are we in the dream or reality?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Didn't I shoot the sun out of the sky...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Uh... kind of, it was General Jing Yuan who helped us shoot it down.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: In any case, since you remember what happened just now... Well, that's put my mind at ease.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What happened while I was out?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Are we in the dream or reality?
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Mm... It's a long story. Simply put, Dan Heng used the jade abacus of allying oath when we were in the middle of a fierce battle, and summoned the general to help us just in time.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: And then, we returned to reality. Look, this is your room.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Everyone else has also returned from the Dreamscape. Himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. Now that you're awake, we should tell the Crew that you're all right. Come with me!
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Not going to come chat with me... ?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: :
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Hey, where are you going?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Hey, we meet again, sleepy head.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Wh—What's Miss Black Swan doing here?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Nothing, Miss March. I noticed  was awake and wanted to check to see how  was doing.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Though the strike from the General was timely, its destruction was also immense. When "Emanators" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: But luckily for them, the Dreamscape is my home turf. Thankfully, I managed to get everyone out before the Harmonious Choir collapsed.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Oh, so that's what happened! Thank you, Miss Black Swan.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Don't mention it, after all, I wouldn't want to see such precious memories vanish. You're heading to see your friends, aren't you? Would it bother you if I walked with you for a short while?
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Of course not... But you're not planning on doing something like last time, are you?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Why would you think that? I've never harbored any ill intentions... well, not when you were around, anyway.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Himeko and Mr. Yang are probably still busy... Let's go look for Dan Heng first.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Look, he's still talking to that cowboy!
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: You're awake, . How do you feel?
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Well fork me! You must be that Stellaron they were talkin' about.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I'm fine. Thank you.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Don't worry, 's been up and about for a while now. But hey, Dan Heng, why don't you introduce this cowboy to  first?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dan Heng, why do you have to blab about everything...?
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: I... didn't mention anything to him.
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Partner, you got it all wrong. I heard it straight from the Memokeeper.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Fork, huh? I myself prefer spooning.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Allow me to introduce him to you: This is Boothill, a Galaxy Ranger.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: During our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by Mr. Sunday...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Which is why we sought you out, to help the Astral Express save the world together.
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: No need for thanks! The Galaxy Rangers' principle is "Correct every injustice one sees". That's how you lot on the Xianzhou put it, right, Dan Heng?
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: More or less.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Wait. Hold on a sec. This is the first time I'm hearing about this "certain person"... Who are you chasing, and why would that lead you to the Express?
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Haha, good question! It's...
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: ...
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Who was it again? Uh, Dan Heng, do you remember?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Come on, don't keep me in suspense.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: IDK man you're looking kinda sus...
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Nah, that ain't it. I just can't seem to recall. Weird, my neuro chip hasn't registered any malfunctions...
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: ...I can't seem to remember either.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Uh... What's going on?
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Uh... heck, forget about it! If it's slipped all our minds, reckon that person was just a minor scoundrel, unimportant. Ain't gonna stop us from piecin' together the story anyhow.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: ...Yes, when the dust settles, I'll just think of a way to recall it in the Memory Zone.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Everyone, let's hurry up and look for Miss Himeko, shall we? 's now a minor star on Penacony, and the entire hotel's concerned about  well-being.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: You're right. Let's head to the lobby then.
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: You guys go. I'm an outsider after all — I'd rather not disrupt a long-awaited reunion.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Look, they're with the General!
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Heh, that's alright. In these times of conflict, for the sake of utmost safety, it is only right that the Alliance steps forward to mediate on behalf of the Astral Express. We must not allow you to take unnecessary risks.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Furthermore, despite the IPC's eagerness for success, it prioritizes "peace" above all, and The Family, trapped though it may be, professes a desire for "Harmony." The Alliance has always won people over with reason. I firmly believe both parties can indeed put aside their differences and come to a peaceful agreement.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: The general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. With the Xianzhou Alliance mediating, peace for Penacony is within reach.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: You flatter me! But ultimately, it's been all down to the Express. Without your efforts, this Sweetdream Paradise would have been claimed by the last remnants of "Order" before there was even a shot at peace...
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Well would you look at that. Here comes the big hero.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: It was nothing, really.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Hahaha, here's the Galactic Baseballer — the paragon of both heroism and humility!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I do what I can.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Hahaha, if it isn't the Galactic Baseballer — a true hero who dares to take action!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Lemme guess, you were thinking about me... again?
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Hahaha, if it isn't the Galactic Baseballer — a hero with unparalleled insight!
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: , are you okay? I heard you couldn't wake up. Are you feeling unwell?
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Don't worry, Mr. Yang. There's nothing wrong with ,  practically burned through a lifetime's worth of jokes on the way here.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: What about you, Mr. Yang? I heard that even Miss Robin wasn't spared, and that guy locked you both up...
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: It's a long story... but, at least Mr. Sunday took it easy on us.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: He used an ability called "tuning" to connect our consciousnesses with his. In other words, he imprisoned us within his consciousness.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Thanks to General Jing Yuan's destruction of the Harmonious Choir, we were able to escape.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Ah, he used that "tuning" on us, too! Does that mean that we were almost imprisoned as well...?
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: I can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. Had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down... without so much as lifting a finger.
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: Speaking of the Oak Family head... Where is he now?
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: It's complicated, but in a nutshell, he's now the former Oak Family head.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: The IPC has named him the key figure in The Family's Penacony split, citing a threat to Cosmic peace. He must represent The Family and answer for the unrest caused. His trial is set to take place at Pier Point.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: The Family quickly labeled him and the remnants of the Order as enemies, declaring the turmoil an internal rebellion. This move effectively barred the IPC from intervening in "Family affairs" on both moral and rational grounds.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Everyone really has their own agenda after all...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Then... what's going to happen to Miss Robin? She and Sunday won't be able to deny their involvement in the Charmony Festival, they're siblings after all...
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: ...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Why the sigh, General?
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: I can only say that this incident is an unexpected mess for the girl. The Alliance will try to persuade The Family to consider this matter carefully during mediation.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: It's time, everyone. The IPC's key members and I have agreed to consult one another before the upcoming negotiation. Do any of you wish to sit in?
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the Crew will naturally accept. However, if the IPC has any reservations...
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Why of course you're welcome! They've mentioned that your team is a trusted ally of the IPC in Penacony, so there's no reason not to welcome you.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Besides, if there can be reliable observers from the Astral Express present, discussions will go more smoothly. So, what do you all think?
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Well then, we shall oblige.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: ...I'm a kind of allergic to those types of situations. I think I'll just head back to my room and start packing.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Not to worry. Himeko and I will take care of things.
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: I'm afraid I'll also have to return to the Express first. The conductor is worried about us. It's best I go and explain the situation.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Thank you. What about you, ? Will you join Welt and me, or have you got other plans?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I'll go with Miss Himeko.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Haha, great.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I HAVE TO help March pack her suitcase...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: What? I can pack it myself, you know...
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Haha, if that's the case, our Galactic Baseballer can join us.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dunno why, but something tells me I only have one real option here...
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Haha, good guess!
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Although I'm not too sure of the reason, the representatives from the IPC have insisted on 's presence — allow me to lead the way, follow me please!
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: The negotiation will commence at the hotel lobby. Everyone, please follow me.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Mr. Aventurine and Miss Topaz are here too... And, who is that over there?
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: The Intelligentsia Guild's Dr. Ratio. This assembly is quite something.
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: It's been a while, my Astral Express friends.
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: I would also extend my sincere thanks to you, General of the Luofu. The presence of everyone here assures that the talks will likely reach a conclusion that satisfies all sides.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Oh? Looks like everyone has come with expectations. Care to share?
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: Of course. Topaz, if you please?
[The Sun Also Rises][Topaz]: Sure, leave it to me.
[The Sun Also Rises][Topaz]: In summary, it's good news — after much deliberation from the Strategic Investment Department's council, the absolute majority of members have agreed to the following resolutions:
[The Sun Also Rises][Topaz]: "In light of long-term considerations for interastral peace, and by authority of Pier Point HQ, the Strategic Investment Department — on behalf of the Interastral Peace Corporation — will permanently relinquish its claim on Penacony sovereignty, and offer unconditional support of The Family's rebuilding efforts on Penacony."
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Uh...
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Heh, now that's something.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: So, the IPC does see the big picture, huh?
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: "All in the name of peace" — that's our motto.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What's in it for you guys?
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: To be honest, it does nothing to benefit the IPC... but it is extremely beneficial to the long-term development of the entire universe.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Doesn't that mean Aventurine took a hit for nothing?
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: Haha, if that's what it takes to bring peace to the entire universe, it's a price I'll gladly pay.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Has the IPC finished sharing all its thoughts? Then it's our turn.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The Guild, much like the Genius Society, has taken a keen interest in the recent calamity in Penacony. Ultimately, both parties have agreed to a comprehensive collaboration, offering technical support for the reconstruction of Penacony...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: ...The floor is yours for the finer points, Mr. Screwllum. Enlighten us, please.
[The Sun Also Rises][Screwllum]: Organic life's unrelenting search to understand the realm of inner spirituality is something I both admire and envy. Inorganic life has no mechanism to evoke dreams. But when my mechanical impulses are activated, my inspiration circuits will start to operate, and I will enter a state defined as "imagination."
[The Sun Also Rises][Screwllum]: Every time, within the realm of imagination, there emerges a fire from the shadows. It is warm, bright. I frequently ponder, this flame might represent the essence of intelligence — a cluster of inspiration ignited by high temperatures. The future direction of the universe may well lie within it.
[The Sun Also Rises][Screwllum]: Alas, they are nothing but projections of my thought system to me — desired, but unattainable. But after learning of Penacony's accomplishments, I have come to realize that the flame is not beyond my grasp.
[The Sun Also Rises][Screwllum]: After deliberations with my partners, we have decided to defer the progress of the Simulated Universe project, and instead assist the Intelligentsia Guild as technological consultants in the research of the Dreamscape and Memory Zone, so that these assets may be better used to serve humanity.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Not only that, we've also established contact with the Garden of Recollection through the IPC, and they've pledged their support for our research endeavors...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I am truly happy for the Dreamchasers on Penacony — the cosmos's brightest and, let's admit, dimmer intellects are now at their service.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Hooray! It's a big win for everyone!
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: But... *sigh* Never mind. At the end of the day, this is a positive outcome.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I keep getting this feeling that this is all too good to be true...
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Agreed. It's hard to imagine members of the Genius Society taking an interest in such mundane research...
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: *sigh* Never mind. At the end of the day, this is a positive outcome.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: No wonder everyone insisted that  be there.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: It heartens me to learn that everyone is willing to put aside their differences for Penacony's plight. I trust that everyone will surely reach consensus in the upcoming negotiations.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Looks like Penacony's future is decided. I'm wondering, is there anything else the Crew is concerned about?
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Peace is our greatest wish — beyond that, we desire nothing else.
[The Sun Also Rises][Jing Yuan]: Haha, well that's good. Now that everyone's minds are at ease, I shall take my leave. You may now depart with peace of mind — the Alliance will deal with all subsequent procedures.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Some time later...
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: If that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on Penacony... Looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Sounds good to me.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: You two head back to the Express first. I'll pick up March and deal with the check-out procedure. Oh also, Miss Black Swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Nothing escapes your attention, Miss Navigator.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: You've been with us this whole time, huh. In any case,  and I will be waiting for you and March on the Express.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Let's go, . Our time on Penacony... has come to a fruitful end.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: :
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: :
[The Sun Also Rises][Topaz]: This is all due to your heroic deeds in Penacony. Everyone's been moved by your integrity and selflessness.
[The Sun Also Rises][Aventurine]: Seems the dust has finally settled, no? Well done, friend.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I am truly happy for the Dreamchasers on Penacony — the cosmos's brightest and, let's admit, dimmer intellects are now at their service.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: , the navigation meeting is about to start. We're all waiting for you!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: :
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem... looks like everyone's present. Let the navigation meeting commence then!
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: This a meeting to decide on our next stop? How we doin' this, by show of hands?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Hold your horses, cowboy. It's for those to decide.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Boothill, why are you here?
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Hah, I'm just catching a lift. Don't sweat it!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Black Swan, how come you're here too?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Shouldn't this be expected of a Memokeeper?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What in tarnation are you guys doing here?
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Allow me to explain: Mr. Boothill and Miss Black Swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the Express for their own personal reasons...
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: As you all may also know, the Astral Express never declines any passenger whose heart yearns for the distant stars. Therefore, they will be traveling with us for a while, until they reach their destinations.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Whoa... The Express is going to be much livelier now. But Miss Black Swan, you'd better not use your Memokeeper abilities to pull any pranks!
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Understood, Miss March. I promise you, you'll never see me in your room while you're taking a break.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Uhm... Don't, you're freaking me out...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: All right. All right. Now that everyone's met everyone, we can continue our navigation meeting!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Firstly, Pom-Pom wishes to thank everyone. If it weren't for you all unearthing the truth about Penacony, Pom-Pom would have never known where Mikhail and the rest had gone...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: What they had to go through was regrettable, but I reckon they all fulfilled their wishes... And it was thanks to all of you — thank you, everyone.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Now then, we come to the crux of this navigation meeting: We must decide on the Express' next stop! Let me introduce our current options.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The first choice is from Himeko: The oceanic planet of Lushaka — a planet composed entirely of water. Many aquatic races reside there. Of course, it's also the home planet of the venerable Nameless, Mikhail.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The second choice is the "Agate World" Melustanin, suggested by Welt. It's famed as one of the initial sites of the Stellaron Disaster and the place where "the Beauty" Idrila ascended. Today, it's celebrated as a planet of undying allure.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The third choice is Edo Star, a planet nestled within a vast ion storm region, currently under assault by the Antimatter Legion. However, the distress signals from there have recently ceased, prompting the IPC's wish for us to check in on the situation.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The last choice, courtesy of Black Swan, is the "Glass Belt" Patrevia, a massive belt of asteroids that was turned to glass by the Lord Ravager Zephyro... These days it's apparently known to house one of the branches of the Mourning Actors troupe.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Ooh... So many options. I'm seeing stars already.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. And then, we'll put it to a vote.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Oceanic planet of Lushaka.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Little Misha and Old Mikhail's homeland... Having been through so much in Penacony, as an aspiring Nameless, I believe a visit to his home world is a must.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Count me in. Still, I imagine that planet must have changed entirely after the Stellaron Disaster. I've heard that its landmasses no longer exist, and the native population has completely changed...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Hmm... I'm not against Miss Himeko's choice, but Edo Star sounds like it's in danger. As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we're probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Three votes for Lushaka, two for Edo...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: Lushaka, the ocean planet!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: The Agate World, Melustanin.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: This trip to Penacony has allowed me to see another side of the Stellaron Disaster... In terms of symbolism, the state of the Dreamscape bears a striking resemblance to the Agate World. Visiting it might deepen our understanding of the Stellaron.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Mm... that makes sense. If that's the case, I vote for the Agate World too.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Hmm... I personally think the situation on Edo Star might be more urgent. As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we're probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Three votes for the Agate World, two for Edo Star...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: The Agate World, Melustanin!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Edo Star.
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we're probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Yes, I agree! As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: and Dan Heng make good points. I'll throw in a vote for Edo Star too.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: If that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. I vote for Edo Star too.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: All votes for Edo Star...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: Edo Star!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: The Glass Belt, Patrevia.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Black Swan has arranged to meet a Mourning Actor there. I've heard they're preparing a special performance... I wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: That type of performance isn't really my cup of tea, but... I'll let you all decide.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Hmm... I'm really interested to check out this troupe's performance, but it really sounds like the Edo Star is in a lot of trouble. As Nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we're probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Three votes for the Glass Belt, two for Edo Star...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: The Glass Belt, Patrevia!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I can't make up my mind...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: If that's the case... How about we go to Edo Star first? If that planet really is in danger, then we should go help them out.
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: March is right. Though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we're probably too late... but I still think we should investigate the situation there.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: You and Dan Heng make good points. I'll throw in a vote for Edo Star too.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: If that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. I vote for Edo Star too.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Four votes for Edo Star, one vote abstained...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Looks like we have a winner. Next stop: Edo Star!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Then this navigation meeting is adjourned. I'll go check the warp jump coordinates. Everyone can catch up on some rest in the meantime.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: When it's time to make the jump, Pom-Pom will make an announcement!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: :
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: , how about a chat? Over here.
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Please let this trip be uneventful...
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: What's with you and always copying the way I talk!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What are you mumbling about?
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Mumbling!? I'm praying!
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: The last couple of trailblazing expeditions have been downright terrifying... It's about time we had some fun, cozy, and cute adventures for a change!
[The Sun Also Rises][March 7th]: Come on, start praying with me! ! [sic] Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful. Please let this trip be uneventful...
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: For some reason, I'm suddenly stricken by the feeling that... we haven't crossed paths in quite some time.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: It has indeed been a while.
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: Perhaps... the joy of reuniting after a long time can also be considered just another part of the Trailblaze.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: This time, you must disembark with us when we reach our destination!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: You're always in my heart.
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: ...I should have known better than to expect anything serious from you.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: This time, you must disembark with us when we reach our destination!
[The Sun Also Rises][Dan Heng]: Got it.
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: This Astral Express sure is comfy... but, I got one tiny problem with it. How come there ain't no potent drinks on this ride?
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: I can live without malt juice, but at least stock somethin' else! Like that "White Gem," common as dirt and not too pricey.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: No way! Our express is only rated 12+!
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: You can't use that 12-years-of-age rule against a mighty Ranger like me!
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Is Himeko's coffee not strong enough for you?
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Uh, well... That's a different kind of "strong"...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I'll help you ask the conductor.
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Thanks, ! Any low-cost swill will do, I ain't fussy.
[The Sun Also Rises][Boothill]: Ha, all these years out in the wild, and now I'm bunkin' in luxury... Gotta say, it's quite the treat.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: , you're fast becoming an excellent Trailblazer. It's an honor to be able to watch you grow.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Hee-hee, stop flattering me.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Don't downplay your achievements, everyone has witnessed your growth. I've known many warriors in my time, and only a few achieve the kind of growth you have. Back home, where I'm from you'd be rated at least an S-tier.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Yup, I'm super-duper awesome!
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: Yes, yes, you are. I've known many warriors in my time, and only a few achieve the kind of growth you have. Back home, where I'm from you'd be rated at least an S-tier.
[The Sun Also Rises][Welt]: It's not been easy for you these past few days. You've earned some downtime. I'm looking forward to seeing how you'll perform on our next journey.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Come to think of it, , this trip to Penacony was the first time we Trailblazed together, wasn't it?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I hope we can Trailblaze together again someday.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to spend together on the Express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: It was too dangerous. I wish you hadn't gone down.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: It's alright! I understand your concern, but it's okay. I'm also a capable Nameless, just like yourself.
[The Sun Also Rises][Himeko]: Turn in early today. You've really been pushing yourself hard recently. If you don't take this chance to recharge, it could lead to long-term problems... It seems fine when you're young, but it's a different story as you age.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: ...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Oh? You're here, . Seeing your reflection among the stars in the porthole... really does seem somewhat surreal.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: How about it, this journey of beautiful dreams... Was it to your liking?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What a rollercoaster ride! It's just... so peak... Keep it coming!
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: I can feel your obvious excitement... That means your memories will also become even more beautiful.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: It kind of left me wanting more, you know...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: That tinge of regret I sense... Ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories I cherish.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Seems like there are still lotsa loose ends, no?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: There's a rich scent of curiosity here... Such memories can be irresistibly captivating.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: It's nothing short of a deus ex machina!
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Ah, such an intense emotion... Heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can't get enough.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: When the next survey comes, I'll be checking the "Too Easy" box... AGAIN.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Oh? Such elusive emotions... I've never encountered memories quite like this before, it's stirred my curiosity.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: So... How about you hand that "small parting gift" back to me? I'm quite eager to have it back.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Mm...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: ...Oh?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What happened?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: It's not this card?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: I... I wasn't the one who broke it...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Hmm, never mind...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: I just... stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Before I explain... I would like to apologize to you, : This farewell gift I gave you isn't really a compass from the Memory Zone... but a merely an empty Light Cone.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Remember when we entered the hotel in the Dreamscape for the first time, and I procured a few trinkets from your companions? Their functions are similar.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: This way, I can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: But... this is not its most intrinsic function.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Light Cones are slices of light used to encapsulate solidified phenomena. This empty Light Cone is the same.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: It can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then... allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: All the world is born from the power of mind and soul, and that power is "memory." To prevent ourselves from being forgotten by the world, we must make the world remember us... or, use our memories to recreate it.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Life, seemingly vast, offers but a scant collection of impactful memories: Some joyful, some sorrowful, some light, some heavy... But you, , are different.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Memory is a reflection of the future. Within that reflection, I see your unparalleled worth. You have the power to craft memories that can captivate the world... Your memory can illuminate the universe's future path.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: And that memory... will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Which is why you want to collect my memories?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Precisely. But, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: You're making me blush...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: How adorable. But, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Help me take a look, am I about to ascend?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: The memories I have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: But, I can tell you one thing: My favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: The reason is simple: In this grandiose and ostentatious dream of The Family's, only you personally experienced the entire course.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: What does that mean?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Stop speaking in riddles!
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Patience, my friend. I will reveal the answer to you... but that time is not now.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Turn around and take a look at your friends. Every one of them is reveling at the arrival of their next destination, all filled with hopes and expectations of their own present and future. Revealing everything at this moment would be a bit of a buzzkill, wouldn't it?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: I'm looking for an opportune time, a time when you're totally at ease... Perhaps, when the night grows hazy, and you're about to drift off would be the most opportune.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: How about one fine night? I will prepare the candles, aromatics, and even a cushy couch to create a cozy dream land for you. And then, I will tell you the answer in the form of a little bedtime story to lull you to sleep...
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Ahem, hi, hello~ Attention all passengers.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The Express is about to make the jump — please be seated and hold on!
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Heh, it looks like we're finally about to set off. There are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us... Why don't we just leave it at that for now?
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Ah, that's right. As a small token of compensation for playing that little trick on you with the empty Light Cone, I will gift you with some words — they hold great significance to me...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: "Life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: You'll remember these words dearly, won't you?
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: In the year 2158 of the Amber Era, the first year of the new epoch, the universe resumed its intended trajectory. The kindling of conspiracy smoldered in Penacony, the Land of the Dreams. Failing to erupt into a blaze, it instead flickered briefly on Qlipoth's anvil, before vanishing in the blink of an eye.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: The dead and those fated to die remain in their eternal slumber, while the living find solace in deep sleep. All clamored in a cacaphony of silence, and then went about their own ways. The cosmos emananted a vitality characteristic of a new era, all for the modest price of a brother and sister's mild grief.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Babies are born as stars extinguish. The silver rail unfolds. The story of the Astral Express comes to a close, yet it also embarks anew.
[The Sun Also Rises][Narration]: Time marches forward, heralding the arrival of a new chapter in the history of Trailblazing expeditions.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: Countless shooting stars streak the sky tonight... If you can pick the right one, it will carry your wish to thousands of distant worlds.
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: You're feeling very relaxed now, aren't you? So then...
[The Sun Also Rises][Black Swan]: It's time to tell you a little bedtime story.

[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission The Sun Also Rises.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Well, let's start with the conclusion — The Crew was defeated in the battle against Sunday. Everyone in Penacony failed, and no one survived.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: But don't panic. The truth, as horrifying as it may be, is not yet irreversible. There's still a glimmer of hope, and that's why I'm here.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Next, I'll use this empty light cone that carries all your memories to relive everything that happened before. And when this story reaches its end, I'm sure someone as clever as you will notice that...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: There's a major flaw in the story you have experienced, yet within that flaw lies a glimmer of hope.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Are you ready for it?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Do you remember everything? When the clock turned back, the Express started a warp jump, sending you to a strange dream. You were bewildered back then, and then a Galaxy Ranger named Acheron showed you a way out.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: When you arrived at The Reverie Hotel, you met the doorman Misha and had a confrontation with Aventurine, an IPC representative. Thankfully, Acheron appeared again and helped you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: After that, you saved Firefly and explored Penacony together. During the tour, you ran into Sparkle disguised as Sampo and accidentally entered a child's dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: There, I rescued both of you from "Death," but Firefly didn't return to reality. She realized the truth and tried to involve you in her plan, but that resulted in an accidental "death." Even more unsettling, you soon encountered another "murder."
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: The two cases of "death" prompted you to investigate the truth behind the sweet dream. Despite your efforts to gather information about the two victims, you didn't make much progress. But you did learn about the Watchmaker from Gallagher.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Meanwhile, Aventurine was secretly carrying out his scheme, in which you were one of the pawns. In the midst of a fierce battle, Acheron revealed her true identity as an Emanator of the Nihility and unsheathed her sword.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: That strike foiled Aventurine's plan and opened a passage between the sweet dream and the original Memory Zone. Upon your arrival at Dreamflux Reef, you learned the truth that "Death" was actually "Dormancy", as well as the truth about the Dreamscape, the Stellaron, and the bellboy, Misha.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: You split up with Sunday and Robin, looking for a way to seal the Stellaron. However, it turned out that Sunday and the Dreammaster had their own hidden agenda, and you had to engage in an ultimate duel on the stage of the Charmony Festival.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Finally, the story reached its conclusion. You emerged victorious, with the Trailblaze triumphing over the Order and Penacony embracing a bright and peaceful future...
[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission The Sun Also Rises.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: This marks the end of the thrilling journey in Penacony. I'm sure you've already noticed something unusual, haven't you?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: The major flaw, which contradicts all the known information, hides in this story...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: My first encounter with Misha at the hotel...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Heh, little Misha... or should I call him the Watchmaker?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: He is only a segment of memory in a dream bubble, but his ambition for the Trailblaze led him to leave the bubble and embark on a grand adventure in Penacony...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: While Misha is a rather special Memory Zone Meme, and he was granted power by the Trailblaze... there's still one thing that he shouldn't be able to do—
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: ...A life born in the Memory Zone could never manifest in reality. So, why did he appear in The Reverie Hotel in reality?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: The answer is simple — He is the one fatal flaw that contradicts all our known information. This means that you, who wholeheartedly believe in this memory...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Are still trapped in the Dreamscape at this very moment.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Wake up, . Break free from this eternal dream and return to the real world. We'll find our answers there.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I was attacked by Sparkle disguised as Sampo...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Sparkle — yes, Sparkle, the most enigmatic and elusive character in the entire story. But unfortunately, she was the first to uncover the truth, and she did purposefully attack you to create confusion.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: By the way, she left me a message to pass on to you. "Always make sure you can distinguish reality from imagination."
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Is that a clue, you may wonder? I'm not sure, although I'm pretty sure that the fatal flaw has nothing to do with that Masked Fool.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: The fake deaths of Firefly and Robin...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Well, although the fake "deaths" of those two ladies don't align with our initial assumptions, this fact itself doesn't contradict the information we have so far.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: I'll go ahead and eliminate that incorrect answer for you. So, what is the fatal flaw?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Acheron unsheathed her sword and revealed the power of the Nihility...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Are you suggesting that the sleeping and shapeless never bestows its gaze upon anyone, and thus no one can truly possess the power of the Nihility?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: That's a very astute guess, but unfortunately, Acheron did progress further down the Path of the Nihility. Her unwavering belief in liberating the world from the grasp of Paths surpasses the capabilities of ordinary humans.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: I'll discard that incorrect answer for you. Take your time and think it through — What is the fatal flaw?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Death" is the disguise of "Dormancy"...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: It's true that Gallagher is a History Fictionologist, but he didn't lie in this matter. In addition, "death" and "dormancy" do arise from the same concept, don't they?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: This is not the fatal flaw in your adventure. Take your time and think it through.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Pom-Pom: The train is about to make the jump!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 5
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Pom-Pom: 4

[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: )
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: :
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: This way, darling.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I feel fine.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: That's good then.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I don't feel so good...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: I know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the Dreamscape than others. This is also why I have to accompany you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: I shall use my methods to relieve you. Don't worry, as your companions are safe — I had both of them each give me a trinket before I entered the dream. This will allow me to feel their presence in the Memory Zone.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: They're already awake in their rooms. Will you be comfortable in following me now? Time waits for no one. We must hurry to the lobby.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Not another one...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Thank you so much, Black Swan.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Finally, I can breathe a sigh of relief.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: What happened?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: What is this place?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: The deja vu is strong with this scene...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I understand you must be confused, and we'll do our best to shed light on the situation. However, before that, it's essential to know that...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: This place is the rift between dream and reality. A place reserved only for those who have awakened from Ena's dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Do you remember Sunday's ambitious plan? He intended to harness the power of the Stellaron, the collective will of over 100,000 Oak Family members, and the desires of everyone in Penacony to usurp the Harmony and restore the Order.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Unfortunately, it didn't stop there. From the early days of our journey into Asdana, we were already affected by the Stellaron. That strange Dreamscape where we met... Maybe it was a sign that your thoughts were beginning to drift away.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: All of this is just a dream?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Did I fall asleep on the Express?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I'm now back at the beginning of the story?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I don't think... the goal of the Order was to put everyone into a deep sleep. Quite the contrary — they used the Stellaron to catalyze the leakage of Asdana's memoria into the material world, allowing the Dreamscape to blend with reality.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...And that included a lot of memoria from the Beyond the Sky Choir. As time came and went, the dreams eventually became indistinguishable from reality, and reality became an illusion. People think they are awake, but their spirits have long since stepped into the temple of Order.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: This is what makes Ena's Dream so powerful. In this paradise governed by the Order, everyone indulges in their delightful dreams and lives happily ever after.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: I believe what you experienced in the sweet dream, except for that flaw, was real. Only in this way could you reach the destination, lifting the crisis in Penacony and embarking on your next trailblazing expedition.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: If it wasn't for Acheron's plan, we might have been trapped in this dream forever.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Fortunately, while the Path of the Order governs all things, it can't affect the Nihility. I came to realize this when the Dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: This is also why you felt a sense of peculiarity when traveling with her.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Well, I'm not as fortunate as she is. Even if I'm a Memokeeper, I was still influenced by the power of the Order and fell into hallucinations.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: However, thanks to your memories, now we still have a chance to turn the tide.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: For mortals, even if they possess the great power of a Path, they can't create a flawless world like Gods do.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: That's why there was a flaw in your dream. In other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you'll have a chance to break free from the dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: The flaw in your dream lies within Misha, who could have never appeared in reality. When I turned the pages of your memories, I realized that I was in an illusion, too.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: We still have a fighting chance.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: So, we lost...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Didn't expect it all comes back to Misha...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Now Sunday has usurped the power of the Harmonious Choir through the Charmony Festival. Asdana has thus fallen into Ena's Dream, transforming everyone equally into the notes of the Aeon.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Failure doesn't mean weakness. Only the strong can gather the will to resist the Order and try to break free.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: We still have a chance, though. To make it happen... please, Black Swan, guide us to those with a strong will.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Alright, please come with me.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: : These people are...?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: They're the ones who accept Ena's Dream and indulge in their happy illusions...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: We have no means to wake them up now. Not even your clockwork will do the trick.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: However, there are still other things we can do. Let's keep going.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Welcome to the Paradise!"
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Here we are.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: :
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Finally, you've arrived.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Let me introduce you to Robin. She woke up from Ena's Dream by her own will, and it's this tough lady who led us here with her song.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: I woke up for the same reason as all of you. In the dream, I experienced something that could never occur in reality...
[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Small Town Grotesque 2.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Are we going to lock it up in a cage? I want to see it fly freely in the sky.
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: Without us, this bird would be too fragile to survive on its own. Do you want it to die?
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: No, but...
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: Then let's take care of it together until it can return to the sky.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: ...Huh?
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: Birds have wings because they're meant to fly. Even if they may crash on the ground one day, they shouldn't be trapped in a cage.
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: Birds belong to the sky, so we should help them return there, right?
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: ...The illusion was so impossibly blissful that I realized it was just a dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: And this is our final hope. Ena's Dream is founded upon the Harmonious Choir, namely everyone's shared wishes. It will only materialize once the aspirations of all beings in Penacony merge as one.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: At present, it has become impervious due to people's desire to remain slumbering within the dream. And in order to destroy it...
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: We must make everyone in Penacony want to wake up.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Now comes the tricky part. How do we do it?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I'm curious, too.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: That doesn't sound simple at all...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Maybe we should just go back to Ena's Dream?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: You want to go back? Unfortunately, human consciousness always gravitates toward reality. Now that you've seen the flaw in the dream, there is no turning back.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Humans' yearning for sweet illusions borders on obsession, leading them to subconsciously resist... the harsh reality.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Therefore, I carefully selected a moment where  was completely unguarded, guiding  to uncover the truth  to make  regain  consciousness.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: However, to wake up everyone in Penacony and get them to share the same determination... that would be nearly impossible.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Indeed. I'm afraid it's almost as difficult as resurrecting an Aeon...
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: But we can't just stay here and do nothing.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: This is a critical moment for the whole universe! Who cares about some dumb number?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: You've woken up, too?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Well, well, well, someone enjoys making a dramatic entrance.
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: Thanks to Black Swan.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: You're welcome. And thanks to the Memokeepers in Penacony, too. I believe your partners... have also awakened from their dreams.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: This is the first step of our plan. With the assistance from the Garden of Recollection, those who possess a strong will, like you, will gradually awaken from the dream. These free wills are the "discord" that will sway Ena's Dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: However, awakening a mere handful of individuals is insignificant compared to the vast number of people immersed in the dream. We must find other ways to awaken the free will of millions of people within a short period of time.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: If breaking through from the inside proves challenging, we can seek assistance from the outside. We've long been aware of a potential solution.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Asdana is a galaxy known for its abundant memoria and the remarkable phenomenon known as Synesthesia Dreamscape. When people first enter this place, they often find themselves and others sharing a collective dream...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: At this very moment, there is only one dream encompassing the entire Asdana system.
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: So you mean, if we can attract a large number of outsiders to this system, their free will would intertwine with this dream and shake it to its core...
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: However, those outsiders might also succumb to the dream and become the foundation of the Order instead. The real challenge is — How can we gather a huge number of people as determined as you within a short period of time?
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: Looks like the Jade Abacus of Allying Oath will be the only solution.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: ...No, no need for that.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Keep your once-in-a-lifetime treasure. We don't need to bother the Xianzhou Alliance for such a tiny request. You want thousands of people with unwavering free will? Hah, that's easy...
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Just leave it to us Galaxy Rangers.
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: You can gather Galaxy Rangers?
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Hah! Outsiders may see Galaxy Rangers as elusive and disconnected individuals, and actually... they're right! And that's why we have a tacit understanding among us...
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Do you know what it is, Acheron?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: It's the relic I returned to you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Exactly. Its owner must have told you that it's meaningless to anyone other than a Galaxy Ranger, and that it can only fulfill its purpose when returned to its rightful owner.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Because it's a burial artifact, worthy only of a hero who has served the Galaxy Rangers with honor. When its light illuminates the universe, it means the fall of a hero, and in the direction it falls...
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Countless meteors will streak across the sky. Those "meteors" are Galaxy Rangers coming from all corners of the Cosmos, driven by a shared purpose, without questioning the cause or counting the cost. Because we abide by a bottom line...
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: The shooting stars of The Hunt only descend on the longest night, and with them... comes the dawn.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: We've stayed silent for far too long. Now, it's time to remind all the cowards, oppressors, and villains of the universe of our presence! I'll be the one to ignite the first spark.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Once the Dreamscape is swayed, I'll complete the second step. I'll fine-tune the slumbering souls with the song of the Harmony, interrupting them with the discord of "Trailblaze" and guiding them towards reality.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: It's true that some people are born strong, and others are born weak. If the Trailblaze is the target of heroes, then the Harmony will guarantee that the strong help the weak. Only the people of Penacony themselves can be the saviors of their homeland.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Their path of happiness should be forged by themselves. While I may not be a Nameless, I'm willing to instill courage in all those who need it.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: This includes my brother as well. Ena's Dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: Your plan sounds well-conceived, but still, it appears somewhat... idealistic and romantic. The flaws rooted in human nature can't be eradicated overnight. Do you believe these efforts alone are enough to convince everyone to choose the right path?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I agree with you, Black Swan. That's why the most critical aspect of this plan is not to convince everyone to choose the right path...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...But to inspire them to save themselves.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: So, you're the key in the end, I assume?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: The Harmonious Choir possesses the power of an Emanator. To overcome it, you'll need the same level of power. The final step in destroying the sweet dream... will be my responsibility.
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: That's a relief to hear.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Now that our roles are assigned, let's get to our battlefields and pose a grand finale!
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: May I have a moment alone with you, ? There's one more thing I need to explain to you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: This grand festival is drawing to its close. This is the starting point for the ultimate stage of our journey... just as it marked the beginning of all the stories in Penacony.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Whatever we're facing, I'm prepared.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I have faith in you. However, before we depart, there is one more thing I must tell you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: This is where Firefly uncovered the truth.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Indeed, she was the first to discover the world beyond the shores of "death" and shared this truth with all of us.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Your words still carry... a profound significance.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Only by reflecting on our steps can we remember the path we should be walking on... and the companions who have walked alongside us.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: There's something you should know. We were able to locate you within this boundless dream and find the key to breaking free from the dream, all because of one person's unwavering dedication...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Firefly. She awakened from the dream ahead of others, discovered the Express amidst the stars, and brought us valuable information about the remnants of the Order. She may have been aided by the script, and it came at a cost...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: As you know, Firefly is a stowaway who entered the Dreamscape in a different way from ours. Without the dreampool in the hotel or assistance from The Family, she can only awaken from this dream in one way... a real "death."
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: We mustn't fail her determination. I'm not implying that we must win this fight no matter what, but our resolve should match that of the courageous lady.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...Are you ready?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Let's embark on the final stage.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Very well. Now, please close your eyes...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: )
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I'm not quite ready yet...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: That's alright. Take your time to contemplate this moment. Once you feel ready, let's step onto the final stage.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission And on the Eighth Day 1.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: How long... has this rain been ongoing?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: If I remember correctly, it has lasted for decades, or even centuries.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: The unwavering determination of The Hunt followers persists even in death, but thankfully... we've guided those lost souls to their lives beyond. They were heroes in their time, and they won't be reduced to puppets of the Nihility in their death.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: You see, the shadows on the sea have vanished. Do you remember? You once said that the sky would clear when the regrets of the departed had faded away.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: But it's still raining...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...I know.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: So, why is all this...?
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: Why did this rain choose me?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Because someone's regrets haven't been fulfilled, perhaps.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Mortals who walk the Paths are like sailors on a vast ocean, leaving behind a trail that creates countless ripples of possibilities. These ripples last longer than the fleeting lifetimes of humans.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: And for some, their presence leaves such a strong mark that it's reflected in the waves.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Sin Thirsters... the obsessions of the Pathstriders. They emerge from the depths of IX, seeing themselves as masters of their own destiny, unknowingly repeating the actions of their past lives.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: They emerge from the Nihility and head toward it, leading purposeless lives. However, these hollow phantoms...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: They have journeyed with me for such a long time.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: So, this is how it is.
[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission And on the Eighth Day 2.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: I... I'm already dead.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...Yes.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: Are you watching over me?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: This is my duty... as the watcher of the Acheron.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I'm guarding the path to the abyss of the Nihility, guiding every soul reluctant to become one with it... back to this side.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: But if this is what the departed ones expected, should you try to change it?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I don't know, but someone once told me that when the inevitable moment came, he hoped that...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Someone would stand at his grave and place a bouquet of flowers.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: Even if... it doesn't make sense at all?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Some tasks have to be done, even if they are pointless. I have... experienced that much already.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Please extend your hand, and then close your eyes.
[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission And on the Eighth Day 3.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I'll carry your wish with me and fulfill it. Only then will I be able to put an end to the final regret by the Dead Sea.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: Will I... ever see them again?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Yes — that is certain.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Because it was you who told me about the Express, your two former companions, the expedition cut short by the Swarm, your narrow escape from death, and your encounter with the Galaxy Rangers...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: And Penacony, the hometown to which you could never return.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: Yeah, for countless times... I got rejected by The Family and had to pass it by.
[And on the Eighth Day][???]: But I knew that my companion was still there... alone...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Mikhail... Are you still there...?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Take my hand and come with me. We... will leave this place.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: You'll embark on a long, long journey, shrouded in darkness. But fear not, as a touch of red will be awaiting you at the end of the path.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: That's the color of "existence." Follow it, and it'll guide you and illuminate the way out. By doing so, you'll eventually reunite in the warmth of the sunlight.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Thank you...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: May death be the end of your boundless dream...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...guiding you back to the waking world.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Welcome to Horizon of Existence...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: This place is one of the thousands of manifestations belonging to the sleeping and shapeless, and it's also an exit out of the Nihility for the awake ones.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Let's bid our final farewells here.
[And on the Eighth Day][Sparkle]: Always distinguish between reality and imagination... alright, Gray?
[And on the Eighth Day][Black Swan]: "Life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: May your schemes... be forever concealed.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Ena's Dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else.
[And on the Eighth Day][Gallagher]: To the imperfect tomorrow.
[And on the Eighth Day][Firefly]: I still remember the question on the invitation letter — Why does life slumber?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Why does life slumber...? We don't know the answer yet, but we're about to awaken from this dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Or perhaps, such is the answer itself.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Leave this place, return to where you belong, and... awaken Penacony from this dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Will you come with us?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: What if folks don't wanna wake up?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Will I get to witness your hidden power?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: As I said, our plan is not about convincing everyone to choose the right path, but about inspiring them to save themselves. So, when will people actively save themselves?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: The answer is... when they are in desperate situations.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Like a drowning individual in the deep sea, when one's body and mind bear immense pressure, agony, confusion, and despair will follow. I firmly believe that...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: The fragility of humankind often freezes them in their tracks, but in truly desperate situations they will strive to save themselves. And now... Penacony has enough heroes to lead them forward.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: It's through this inherent self-centered instinct that people exert their utmost effort, even when they know their struggle is fruitless. As absurd as it may seem, it's their resistance.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: As for now, ... It is time to guide them, not as a savior, but as a Nameless among those mortals.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: In this way, you will reunite in the warmth of the sunlight.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: The rain... is intensifying. Before we part ways, please allow me to ask a few final questions.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: So far, you have forged unbreakable bonds with numerous individuals and entities in the sweet dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Might I ask if you fear severing these bonds with your own hands?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I feel no fear.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: If there is a vast, lifelike dreamland that is virtually indistinguishable from reality... a realm without death, where everyone can attain the happiness and fulfillment they deserve, living blissfully ever after.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I would ask — Would you wish to stay?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I would never ever want to live in a dream.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Imagine if this splendid dream were fated to fall apart: Friends, family, strangers... followed by the gentle breeze, soaring birds, the stars... and ultimately, yourself.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Everyone, and every face they remember, the joy and the heartaches, the vows sealed and those left hanging... all will inevitably march towards a predetermined ending. If you had grasped the journey's finale right from its inception...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I would ask — Would you still embark on this journey?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: I would blaze a trail without hesitation.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I'm glad. The answer itself doesn't matter. What matters is that you've made a decision.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Listen, touch, and ponder, and therein lies the sensation. Cherish it, because that's what makes us exist. Such is the only answer humans can offer when facing the Nihility.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: If the Nihility represents the primal fear of life, rendering any lofty convictions insignificant under THEIR imposing shadow...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Then behind this shadow, there must exist the most fervent source of light in the world.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the Nihility...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: We must pursue that primordial light.
[And on the Eighth Day][Media]: Trailblaze Mission And on the Eighth Day 3.mp4
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Now come to think that you exist in the Nihility, and you watch over others to depart it...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Such a task is absurd and meaningless.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Nevertheless, someone has to do it. As for the meaning you mentioned...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Even if it's a meaningless task, I've come this far, haven't I?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Even if the future you forge may not even belong to you?
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: It may not belong to me, but it definitely belongs to someone.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": What hardships you must have experienced...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": In that case, allow me to do something meaningless, too...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Please tell me your name.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": Perhaps my existence will vanish in the next moment... and nobody will remember this conversation or your answer...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": But I believe... that your name should be remembered...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Tiernan": And this universe... will remember it as well.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: For me, some things are difficult to recall, yet there are others... that I find challenging to forget.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Such is "memory," a creation of the past that blossoms into significance in the distant future.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: I remember that marks the start of my journey, the origin of the vibrant red hue in my life, and the most fervent element amidst every tempest...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: That's my name...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: Raiden Bosenmori Mei.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: The golden dream is getting restless.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: In the coming long night, I'm afraid you will face many setbacks and witness many tragedies.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: And in the end, you will only see in black and white.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: But please believe me that in that monochrome world, there will be a glimpse of fleeting red, and when you make a choice...
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: ...it will appear once more.
[And on the Eighth Day][Acheron]: What you must do, is ponder its significance, then return to the waking world.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Acheron & : That's where we all find our answers.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: ...Have you broken free from the dream of Order?
[And on the Eighth Day][March 7th]: We've done enough sleeping already, let's show them a wake-up call!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: Without Order, how can the weak be righteous?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: If you have any objection, feel free to make your case...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: With 107,336 notes, I solemnly invite you to join the glorious chorus — and ascend to the heavens!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: If the Dreamscape is indistinguishable from reality, can it still be called an illusion?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: With this perfect melody I command — recreate paradise anew!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: ...Music?
[And on the Eighth Day][Welt]: There seems to be another kind of sound coming into the Order's symphony...
[And on the Eighth Day][Welt]: Penacony's first, and last, disharmony.
[And on the Eighth Day][Welt]: Those imprisoned in their dreams are awakening for Freedom.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: Robin, is that you singing...?
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Brother, you have heard their cries... This is not the paradise they hoped for.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: Even so, they don't know where they should be heading. That's why... I had to become the lone star in the sky to guide them.
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Even if that star... must hang in a perpetual night of solitude?
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Brother... The weakness of humanity cannot be redeemed by others.
[And on the Eighth Day][March 7th]: Even if the future is full of pain... we won't escape from it!
[And on the Eighth Day][Dan Heng]: You have a noble soul... Don't be shackled by the past!
[And on the Eighth Day][Himeko]: Witness... the will of the weak!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: If we had never experienced solitude, how could we have embarked on different paths?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: Now, our final talk has concluded.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: All the work of creation has been completed.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: The inevitable day has arrived...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: The Embryo of Philosophy...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Harmonious Choir" The Great Septimus: will reshape for us all of reality!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: If your "paradise" can save more people, sever my path with your hands.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: On the second day, grant the Calendar...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: O, fallen Aeon... may I honor you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: On the fourth day, grant Value...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: With this seven-day vow, I command you to heed my summon.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: On the fifth day, grant Rules...
[And on the Eighth Day][March 7th]: Uh oh, I have a bad feeling about this!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: On the sixth day, grant Meaning...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: It was not you who created all things.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: On the seventh day, grant Dignity... About to witness Im Anfang war die Tat!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: It was humanity that created you!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: ...Your divine being will become the foundation of our paradise!
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: "Embryo of Philosophy" Sunday: By the solemn desire for Order...
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Stop it... You want to achieve the paradise we promised, but the Order is not the only choice!
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: True happiness and the meaning of life lie in defying the Nihility and embracing all that life offers!
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: So... Why does life slumber?
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: : Because... someday...
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: : We will wake from our dreams!
[And on the Eighth Day][Sunday]: The night is still... too short...
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: Brother...
[And on the Eighth Day][Robin]: The dream... is over.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: In the first year of the AE 2158, a fiery conspiracy erupted in the Land of the Dreams, but soon faded in chaos and destruction.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: Whispers carried the tale of those fateful 48 system hours, when a sun teetered on the precipice of collapse, a paradise stood on the brink of destruction, and a world was poised to surrender to its new master. Amidst it all, a body decayed, a pack of vultures gathered, and a brother and sister were doomed for long separation.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: And so, an Aeon succumbed to slumber once more. Some celebrated this fall, while others mourned. Among the insignificant witnesses, mere specks in the vast tapestry of the universe, it was said that this time, the Aeon met THEIR demise with dignity.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: As the Cosmos bathed in the radiance of a pure dawn, a tempestuous storm brewed on the horizon. The chant of "Everything for the Amber Lord" grew ever louder. Yet, no matter how one contemplates it, time inexorably swings Qlipoth's colossal hammer in eternal cycles.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: The tale of the Astral Express reaches both its conclusion and a new beginning. Time marches forward, heralding the arrival of a new chapter in the history of Trailblazing expeditions.
[And on the Eighth Day][Narration]: ...
[And on the Eighth Day][Guileless Girl]: Brother, do you think... the stars will fade away?
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: Where did that come all of a sudden?
[And on the Eighth Day][Guileless Girl]: Because the constellation that looks like a bird, the... Torrent Eagles... looks a bit dim lately.
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: It's the Torment Eagles. Don't worry, it's still there. It's just it's located in the inner ring of Penacony and can only be seen when spring and summer overlap.
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: As for the question you asked... I think stars do die, just like people.
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: But do you know, sister? No star actually belongs to the present. The light we see from them is from a long time ago.
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: Even after the stars perish, their light will travel millions of light-years, spanning countless years, to illuminate the night sky of another world.
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: In our paradise, I believe there will be a star like that, shining with the same light. Its radiance will last "forever," and its name... will be "happiness."
[And on the Eighth Day][Guileless Girl]: No, not just one star! We should have two stars... or maybe even more!
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: Yeah, you're right.
[And on the Eighth Day][Guileless Girl]: It's a deal!
[And on the Eighth Day][Trustful Boy]: It's a deal, then. This is our promise, and nothing will sway our ideals.
[And on the Eighth Day][Guileless Girl]: Yeah, you bet!
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: It's a pleasure to hear your voice again. Congratulations, you've become the... biggest winner of this festival.
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Are you just calling to poke fun at me?
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: No, I'm just impressed. Not only did you venture alone into Penacony and discover the truth of Dreamflux Reef, but you also managed to escape with the help of that Knight of Beauty...
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: Remember the recording you received from your Trailblaze friend? It's now the most valuable chip in this game.
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: However, this came at a high cost... Losing a Cornerstone is a hefty price to pay. Diamond just called a meeting to discuss what to do with you.
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Just as I expected. So, is Diamond planning to demote me, or kick me out of the Ten Stonehearts?
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: Why don't you take a wild guess?
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Well, alright. Then I'll guess... he's going to promote me to P46?
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: Alright, what will you wager?
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Are we talking about an actual bet here? I don't wanna wager anything just so that you can swindle it all in the end.
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: But if it's just a friendly bet, I'll put on the line what I did when we first met. I'll bet my life, ma'am.
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: Interesting. But since it's Diamond's call, no one can predict the outcome.
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: I'm on my way to Penacony. Once everyone is settled, we'll return to Pier Point for the final showdown.
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Sounds like I'll be out of the action for a while. Finally, a chance to kick back and relax?
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: Yeah, leave everything to me and Topaz, child. Thanks to you, as soon as the Jade Stone was delivered to The Family's compound, we finished up our preparations.
[And on the Eighth Day][Jade]: The seeds we planted have taken root. Soon... it'll be time to "reap" the rewards.
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: ...Huh?
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Let's wrap it up for now. Looks like I've got a visitor here...
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: Oh? So many surprises today. Didn't expect a Galaxy Ranger and wanted criminal to show up here...
[And on the Eighth Day][Aventurine]: ...One who managed to take out two IPC members under the noses of our fleet. Do you understand what that means?
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Screwubbaboo, I just put them to sleep! Don't try to intimidate me with that nonsense. Besides, I've taken down more IPC lackeys than the residual value you've squeezed, and I don't mind adding a few more zeroes to my wanted poster.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: I have a question for you. Be honest now, or I won't think twice about puttin' a bullet in your fudgin' head.
[And on the Eighth Day][Boothill]: Tell me... Where is Oswaldo Schneider?

[Unconquered][March 7th]: Wake up... Wake up...
[Unconquered][March 7th]: ...Hey, ! Wake up! The sun's frying your butt!
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Are you okay? Can you hear me? I didn't hear a peep from your room, and it really freaked me out.
[Unconquered][Narration]: Am I dreaming?
[Unconquered][March 7th]: You're not dreaming. We're in The Reverie Hotel, in the real world. The Order's dream is over.
[Unconquered][Narration]: Woah, this conversation is such déjà vu...
[Unconquered][March 7th]: What are you talking about? Are you still half-asleep or something...? The Order's dream is over.
[Unconquered][Narration]: Stop making a big fuss.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Hey, I was seriously worried when you didn't respond. Thank goodness. The Order's dream is over.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Even though it's been a day, I still break into a sweat when I think about it. Our Trailblazing expedition almost ended in Penacony...
[Unconquered][March 7th]: I'm so jealous that you got a good night's sleep. I was traumatized and too scared to even close my eyes. I thought if I fell asleep, I'd never wake up again.
[Unconquered][Narration]: What happened to the Stellaron?
[Unconquered][Narration]: Where are the others?
[Unconquered][March 7th]: They've already left, leaving this kindhearted girl to wake you up. You owe her big time.
[Unconquered][Narration]: You'll have dark circles under your eyes.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: A natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
[Unconquered][March 7th]: The Stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. The ordinary people in Penacony have no idea what happened. They just feel like something is missing from their memories.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: The Family's official statement was like, "The Charmony Festival was attacked by an unidentified Stellaron and came to a halt." After all, they can't just reveal the truth about the Order.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Now, all the major lineages, except for the Oak Family, are dealing with the aftermath. The Family has invited the Crew to the Radiant Feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Everyone's waiting for you, so hurry up and pack. We're leaving as soon as you're ready!
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality...
[Unconquered][Narration]: What is the "Radiant Feldspar"?
[Unconquered][March 7th]: It's a massive airship, and it's awesome! I heard it's never shown to the public. Only VIP guests of The Family get to board it and enjoy the breathtaking views of Penacony.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: The Iris Family sent us a bunch of souvenirs, fruit baskets, plus this fancy button model. After you're back on your feet, you can enjoy them all... We're pretty much celebrities on the Planet of Festivities now, aren't we?
[Unconquered][Narration]: Tell me more about the current state of Penacony...
[Unconquered][March 7th]: The Stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. The ordinary people in Penacony have no idea what happened. They just feel like something is missing from their memories.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: The Family's official statement was like, "The Charmony Festival was attacked by an unidentified Stellaron and came to a halt." After all, they can't just reveal the truth about the Order.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Now, all the major lineages, except for the Oak Family, are dealing with the aftermath. The Family has invited the Crew to the Radiant Feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
[Unconquered][Narration]: What happened to you in Ena's dream?
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Why the sudden interest in that? Well, I was dragged into the sweet dream. I felt a cold tentacle diving into my memories, but something else was there, so the tentacle suddenly disappeared.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: And then, I dreamed about stuffing my face with delicious food and going on a shopping spree... Sunday didn't seriously believe that was the life I wanted, right? Breaking free from that cheesy illusion... was just a piece of cake.
[Unconquered][Narration]: Let's go meet up with others.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Yeah, let's go! We've got some time before we board the ship, so let's catch up with everyone at Dreamjolt Hostelry.
[Unconquered][Narration]: I've got something else to do.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Oh, okay. Hurry up then. We'll leave when you're ready.
[Unconquered][March 7th]: Well, can we go now? Or is there something else you want to talk about?
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: How extravagant, just like Epsilon. How was it? Did it live up to your Dreamscape expectations?
[Unconquered][Firefly]: You already asked that when we first got here.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Yeah, and you said "no" back then. But after all this madness, I'd say you've grown fond of it.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Just a heads-up, you're still on the Bloodhound Family's wanted list. So, keep a low profile.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: And this time, it's Firefly in the picture, not Sam. That's gotta be a whole new experience for you, right?
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Indeed. In Kafka's words... that's also a "missing part" of my life.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Still, it'd be quite inconvenient if I can't move freely. Could you help me out, Silver Wolf?
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: I knew you'd say that. Don't worry. I've hacked all the systems and left no trace.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Don't do anything that may draw attention, and don't talk with guards, they might recognize you. Keep these two points in mind, and you can go wherever you want unbothered.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Thank you
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: No problem. Miss Samuel. Haha, I love this fake name.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Now that we're done here in Penacony, what will you do in your free time? I heard the Genius Society is here. How about we go stir up some excitement?
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: ...I didn't bring you back to hear an answer like that.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Don't worry. The script says that I'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the Planet of Festivities.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: How will I know if I don't try? All possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: You may not realize it, but you have a bad habit: Whenever you seem to be asking a question, you've already made up your mind, and no words will dissuade you.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Anyway, Kafka asked me to pass on this message: "If you see anything fabulous in Penacony, get one for me too. Just swipe my card, you know the PIN."
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: She didn't specify anything, but I guess she means a dress, coat, sunglasses, or something else... You know better about fashion than I do.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Sure, I'll keep an eye out. There's tons of options at Oti Mall. Do you think she'll like trinkets like... hair accessories or brooches?
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Those sound more like something for young girls. Maybe you should keep them for yourself.
[Unconquered][Silver Wolf]: Oh, by the way, Blade didn't explicitly say it, but I think he was trying to say something like... "Temptation will show up again in Penacony." He's always so subtle with his words.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: Got it. He was just worried about me. Relax, Silver Wolf. You know me.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: I won't do anything crazy. I just want to wander around and see more of the world for myself. I want to buy some Oak Cake Rolls. I've had a cake roll every day since I arrived in Penacony, from the first day to the last.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: But today, I'll buy two and give you one. And if you don't like them, I'll enjoy double the pleasure. Or I can bring one to Kafka, as she never refuses. Or maybe I'll give it to... Blade. He'll appreciate it.
[Unconquered][Firefly]: That's not written in the script, right? But as you see...
[Unconquered][Firefly]: I've added new footnotes to my destiny.
[Unconquered][Narration]: Switching to Topaz's POV...
[Unconquered][Narration]: Meanwhile, Topaz boards a certain luxurious airship in Penacony, awaiting the beginning of an important meeting...

[All About Eve][Narration]: Meanwhile, on the Radiant Feldspar...
[All About Eve][Thomas]: Welcome, Director Topaz! The Family ambassadors are still inside making preparations, but the Big Boss hasn't arrived yet. It'll be a while before the conference starts, I'm afraid.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Huh, quite a spectacle. The Family really knows how to make things look impressive.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: I thought they would choose a more formal and low-key location for the conference. I didn't expect them to go with a luxury airship...
[All About Eve][Thomas]: About this, Director... I've asked around. This airship, named the Radiant Feldspar, belongs to the Alfalfa Family.
[All About Eve][Thomas]: This conference between the IPC and The Family will have a direct impact on Penacony's future. Such an important event should have been held at... at... well... somewhere secretive in the Moment of Morning Dew.
[All About Eve][Thomas]: The atmosphere here... Tsk, it doesn't feel serious enough.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Hmm...
[All About Eve][Topaz]: If I'm right, this conference is probably just a prelude. Whoever organized it wants to assess the IPC's stance beforehand.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: This influential figure either has their own ambitions and wants to reach a preliminary agreement, or they plan to put pressure on us to make us back off.
[All About Eve][Thomas]: Ohh! Your mind is always so sharp, Director Topaz! When the Big Boss arrives, please remind her to be cautious and watch out for any traps...
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Hahaha, thank you for the reminder, but I don't think that will be necessary. When she's at the table, it's the others who need to be cautious.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Just tell everyone on our team to stay focused on their tasks and not worry about the negotiations.
[All About Eve][Thomas]: Oh... got it. I'll do it right away.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Oh, and one more thing.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Don't call Miss Jade "Big Boss" in front of her, or there will be serious consequences. I mean, really serious.
[All About Eve][Thomas]: G-got it! Thank you for the reminder, Director!
[All About Eve][Topaz]: None of the important figures have arrived yet... Looks like the conference won't be starting for a while.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Such a bustling place. I think I'll take a little walk around.
[All About Eve][Numby]: Oink... Oink, oink! Oink!
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Are you hungry, Numby?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Food in the dream... shouldn't taste bad, right?
[All About Eve][Narration]: Toss a Potato Fries Sundae to Numby.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Numby, catch!
[All About Eve][Numby]: ...Oink! Oink, oink!
[All About Eve][Numby]: *hiccup*
[All About Eve][Narration]: Numby gulps down the Potato Fries Sundae, then lets out a satisfied puff.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Looks delicious, huh? I should have taken a bite first.
[All About Eve][Narration]: Toss an Oak Cake Roll to Numby.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Numby, catch!
[All About Eve][Numby]: ...Oink! Oink, oink!
[All About Eve][Numby]: Oink... Oink...
[All About Eve][Narration]: After eating the Oak Cake Rolls, Numby seems a bit uncomfortable.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Oops, not to your liking huh... Sorry, I'll treat you to a nice meal once we get back to reality.
[All About Eve][Narration]: Toss a Floatdisc Burger to Numby.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Numby, catch!
[All About Eve][Numby]: ...Oink! Oink, oink!
[All About Eve][Numby]: Oink! Oink, oink!
[All About Eve][Narration]: Numby lets out an earnest cry, as if a Floatdisc Burger can't satisfy its appetite.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: There, there. Don't be so greedy. Leave some for the other guests!
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: So many buttons... How many centuries would it take to press them all?
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: Didn't expect those pooches to actually recycle them all...
[All About Eve][Numby]: Oink? Oink...
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Huh? What are these?
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: A-ahem! For your safety, please stay away from those objects.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: For my safety? Are these buttons something dangerous?
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: Not exactly... Lately, there's been a prankster in the sweet dream who's been handing out strange button devices to anyone he meets.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: According to those involved, he said something like, "Just press this button, and all of Penacony will explode!"
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: Luckily, no one believed him. Still, the Bloodhound Family collected these buttons just to be on the safe side.
[All About Eve][Narration]: Haven't the hounds caught the culprit yet?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Where's that prankster? Haven't the hounds caught him yet?
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: Hah! That guy has some skills, I have to admit that.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: However, you know... the Bloodhound Family won't give up. Whoever disrupts order in the Dreamscape will face severe consequences!
[All About Eve][Narration]: Hasn't anyone actually tried pressing it?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: What will happen if you press it? Hasn't anyone actually tried?
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: Well... perhaps you don't know much about Penacony? All the guests here have one thing in common: They're terrified of death.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: Anyway, The Family will deal with these things. Please kindly keep your distance.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Guard: For your safety, please stay away from these buttons!
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Greetings, madam. What can I do for you?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Hello. Could you tell me more about the Radiant Feldspar?
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: I assume you are the ambassador of the IPC Strategic Investment Department? It's my honor to assist you.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: The Radiant Feldspar is owned by Mr. Oti Alfalfa, head of the Alfalfa Family. Mr. Alfalfa invested a significant amount in building this luxurious airship an Amber Era ago, and it has been sailing across the Twelve Hours of the Dreamscape ever since.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Oh, so it's owned by Old Oti himself! No wonder this ship is so lavishly decorated.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Indeed, Mr. Alfalfa has impeccable taste. Only the most prestigious guests are invited by the Alfalfa Family to board this airship.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Please allow me to continue with my introduction. The Radiant Feldspar had been cruising over the Sea of Dreams in Penacony for an entire Amber Era, but its voyage was temporarily halted due to the recent reverberation...
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Reverberation? Such a formal way of putting it. You're really downplaying the whole thing.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Ah... I apologize. Please, continue.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: ...Ahem. Following the previous reverberation in the sweet dream, the Radiant Feldspar had to suspend its voyage temporarily.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Thankfully, the factors that disrupted the Dreamscape have been resolved. However, due to... well... certain special reasons, the Charmony Festival, originally scheduled at the Penacony Grand Theater, had to be temporarily postponed.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: So Mr. Alfalfa suggested relocating the Charmony Festival to the Radiant Feldspar, taking this opportunity to announce the resumption of the airship's voyage.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Well, that would meet The Family's needs and also create momentum for Mr. Alfalfa himself. Quite fitting for a legendary tycoon like him.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Thank you for explaining matters to me. Goodbye~
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: I wish you a great time aboard the Radiant Feldspar.
[All About Eve][Numby]: Oink... oink?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Hello?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: ...The Talent Motivation Department again? Internal review? Will it ever end?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: ...
[All About Eve][Topaz]: I'm working on a major project, I don't have time to squabble with you guys.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: ...
[All About Eve][Topaz]: The way I handled the Jarilo case was approved by senior management, and all of the project logs and call records are complete. Can't you check them yourselves?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: I just don't understand... Why are you so fixated on this minor case and constantly escalating it? Seriously, what's your purpose?
[All About Eve][Jade]: Sounds exhausting... Why not just hang up?
[All About Eve][Jade]: In my opinion, you handled that project quite well.
[All About Eve][Jade]: A little ball of ice in exchange for the Astral Express' good favor — that's not a bad deal for the Department.
[All About Eve][Jade]: It's been a while, little Jelena.
[All About Eve][Jade]: I've been looking forward to working with you. Never imagined this day would come so soon.
[All About Eve][Jade]: You can tell me anything, just like old times.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: It's been a while, Madam Jade. I'm honored to have the opportunity to work with you.
[All About Eve][Jade]: You're still so formal, aren't you? Forget about the hierarchy and treat me as your equal. No need for unnecessary titles like "madam".
[All About Eve][Topaz]: I'm sorry, but it might take some time to get used to that. After all... you are a senior.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Well, now that we're both members of the Ten Stonehearts, I need you to be at your best, especially since the upcoming negotiations leave no room for error.
[All About Eve][Jade]: As sharp as you are, I'm sure you've figured out the true purpose of this conference, right?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: I believe Old Oti has taken it upon himself to test our limits before the official negotiations between the IPC and Penacony.
[All About Eve][Jade]: That's true, and it works in our favor. Do you know why?
[All About Eve][Topaz]: If we can reach some sort of agreement with Old Oti beforehand and gauge our opponent's boundaries, our future negotiations will go much more smoothly. That's the obvious benefit.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Exactly, and the hidden benefit is that... as the head of the Alfalfa Family, his actions suggest that the Five Lineages might not be as united as the Odes of Harmony would suggest.
[All About Eve][Jade]: As long as the influence of Harmony hasn't completely permeated their core, personal desires will always have their way. Thankfully, influential figures in Penacony haven't entirely suppressed their own desires.
[All About Eve][Jade]: It's similar to the power struggles within the IPC. The supposed "all for one" philosophy shared by the Five Lineages... it's just a slogan now that the Dreammaster has gone.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: After the downfall of the Oak Family, Old Oti's faction became the dominant force in Penacony. Even if we consider only the succession order, he's the longest-serving and most senior among all the Family heads.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Yes, that's exactly why we need to handle the conference following an agreed-upon strategy. It's like playing a game of chess, where every move needs to be carefully thought out.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Absolutely. The three steps of negotiation: Listen, test, and strike. That's what you taught me.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Pretty clear, although you seem to have changed the order in the Jarilo case.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: That was based on my personal experience.
[All About Eve][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: I apologize for interrupting your conversation, but the family head is ready to meet the ambassadors from the Strategic Investment Department.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Time to get to work. Let's prepare ourselves and meet that esteemed "supporting actor."
[All About Eve][Jade]: Remember, our goal is to create an opportunity for the IPC to enter Penacony. Aventurine has already made a small opening, and you and I... we're going to tear it wide open.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohohoho! Welcome aboard my ship, the Radiant Feldspar, smart and charming ladies!
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Please, have a seat! Let's have a pleasant conversation!
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohoho! Welcome aboard, my dear ladies! Forgive me for any lack of attentiveness that might have led to a lengthy wait outside.
[All About Eve][Jade]: No problem at all, Mr. Alfalfa. It's my honor to meet you in person. You may not be aware, but the book Oti Alfalfa: The Biography is a must-read for all Strategic Investment Department employees.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: After all, to many, you are the legendary figure who single-handedly built the Penacony economy.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohoho! I expected no less from the Ten Stonehearts from the Strategic Investment Department! You're definitely skilled in the art of conversation.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: I always enjoy talking to smart people because we don't have to beat around the bush, we can just get straight to the point instead. Since I invited you IPC ambassadors on board, I'm sure you've figured out the topic I'd like to discuss, yes?
[All About Eve][Jade]: The future of Penacony, if I'm not mistaken.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohoho! Precisely! Those few words represent a terribly complicated situation indeed!
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Let's take that golden-haired guy who's not showing up for example. He put in great effort and almost got himself killed, but what was it all for?
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Wasn't it eventually to create an opportunity for you IPC to regain control of the precious Asdana? Ohohoho...
[All About Eve][Jade]: The wisdom and experience you've accumulated over ten Amber Eras are truly impressive.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Let's assume your assumptions are correct, Mr. Alfalfa. How would you respond to the IPC's actions?
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: I appreciate your composure, Miss Jade! You must have witnessed much in your worldly experiences.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: However, perhaps you don't know much about Penacony... Ohohoho... Old Oti won't sit idly by when faced with a greedy wolf.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Please go ahead... I'm all ears.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohoho... then I'll be straightforward. I requested this meeting before the official conference to dissuade the Strategic Investment Department from trying to lay a finger on Penacony.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: If you back off now, you can make a smooth exit... and prevent the IPC from losing face during more important negotiations.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: One of our P45 executives was attacked and nearly killed in the Dreamscape. The IPC can't simply ignore this incident. Moreover, considering the turbulence during the Charmony Festival... Penacony's credibility has taken a hit in the public's eyes.
[All About Eve][Topaz]: Despite your determined attitude, the issues plaguing Penacony are real, are they not?
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: You used the term "real," Miss Topaz, but let's not forget that this is the realm of dreams! If you want to succeed here, you need ambition and unconventional thinking!
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Curious about how I plan to respond to the IPC? Well, I don't mind sharing. My actions will help Penacony take a significant step forward by "self-listing" and going public!
[All About Eve][Topaz]: ...Going public?
[All About Eve][Jade]: If I'm not mistaken... you want to bypass the IPC and go public on a universal scale?
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Precisely! Instead of watching the IPC gnaw away at Penacony, I'd prefer to open the doors of the sweet dream to the entire universe.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Starting today, anyone in the Cosmos can become a shareholder of the Land of the Dreams! This is the path of Harmony I'll choose! Ohohohoho!
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: This reform should have been implemented earlier, but unfortunately, the Oak Family were a bunch of blockheads blinded by "Order..." Their level of intellectual flexibility doesn't even come close to an old fellow like me.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Thanks to the little "reverberation" earlier, the biggest obstacle between me and my reforms has been eliminated! Ohohohoho!
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: The Alfalfa Family will publicize the financial results of Sweetdream Paradise, so that the entire universe can see that despite the catastrophe, Penacony still holds immense potential and opportunities, and that The Family remains confident in its future.
[All About Eve][Jade]: ...
[All About Eve][Jade]: Crisis and opportunity are two sides of the same coin. So, you've been waiting for the right moment for Penacony to regain the spotlight.
[All About Eve][Jade]: And if Penacony should seize this opportunity to overcome adversity... Even if the IPC tries to intervene, every move we make will be scrutinized by trillions of people.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohoho... now I'm convinced that you've indeed familiarized yourself with my biography, Miss Jade. So, about your next move... please consider it carefully.
[All About Eve][Jade]: Indeed, we need some time to digest such a wealth of information.
[All About Eve][Jade]: I suggest we conclude the first half of our conference, Mr. Alfalfa. Please allow Topaz and me to confer privately for a few moments and to respond on behalf of the IPC later.
[All About Eve][Old Oti]: Ohohoho, of course. Take your time, dear ladies.
[All About Eve][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[All About Eve][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: The Alfalfa Family had a meeting with the IPC?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: I got this information from a message sent by that IPC ambassador. He said it was to "return the favor."
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: It's not hard to imagine. Penacony today is pretty much like the frontier prison it once was, with external forces casting greedy eyes and the undercurrent of Order lurking within.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Instead of falling into a situation where they are plagued by both external and internal threats, Penacony would rather take a step back and invite the IPC to negotiate at the table, ostensibly to cooperate, but in reality, to secure more opportunities for their own survival.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: Well, no wonder they sought the mediation from the Astral Express. In your opinion, who should we stand behind?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: I don't think the followers of the Harmony are completely innocent victims in all of this. For reasons unknown, they have a strong desire to smooth things over, which leads to speculation about their motives.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: If either The Family or IPC were to assume full control of Penacony, it would return to its previous illusory dream of hedonism, and the efforts of those previous Nameless... would once again go to waste.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: There you are. Did you rest well?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: I didn't disturb you since you were in a deep sleep.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: It feels like I had a really long dream.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Even long dreams eventually come to an end. Our adventure in Penacony is reaching its conclusion.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Where is Himeko?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: She went to negotiate with The Family as a representative of the Crew. She'll contact us once her arrangements are ready.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Please continue the topic.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: After Ena's dream was shattered, The Family branch from the Montour System soon arrived and swiftly took control of the situation. Most members of the Oak Family fell unconscious, but fortunately, their lives were not in danger.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: The mastermind behind the plans was confirmed to be Gopher Wood, the previous Dreammaster, but by the time we arrived... he was dead already.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: And... what about Sunday?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: He'll face a trial. As for further details... The Family would rather not disclose them.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: How did the guests react?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Since The Family branch from the Montour System managed to quash the spread of rumors within a short period of time, the majority of guests were unaware of the situation, and their lives remained largely unaffected.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: What will happen to Penacony?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: That's what we're about to witness on the Radiant Feldspar.
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: Ultimately, the public perceived the incident as an attack by evil forces targeting the Charmony Festival. They believe The Family failed to safeguard the sweet dream, significantly eroding their credibility in the process.
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: While quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact...
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: After all, you don't know who's awake and who's pretending to be asleep. While they'll open their eyes in the face of danger, once the danger subsides, they'll embrace the sweet dream again.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Here's a toast, with three glasses of "Glory of the Trailblaze" to all of you.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Hello again.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Yeah, it's good to see you all again, although we might be saying goodbye again after this reunion.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: How come you're here too?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: What are you talking about? This is my lounge.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: It's good to see you all again, although we might be saying goodbye again after this reunion.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: When will the Astral Express leave Penacony?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: We'll stay a bit longer, but not too long.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: So, this is our final meeting, then? If this is a farewell, then it seems to be missing something.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Music? Atmosphere? Ah, maybe a special drink to honor those who are not here.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Let's see. The mixed drink should be solemn, dignified, and unique, as we'll use it to pay respect to those fallen heroes...
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: To the Nameless resting in peace... and to Gallagher.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: It's rare for all passengers to leave the Express together during a Trailblazing expedition, but for Penacony... it seems most appropriate.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: But what about the Express?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: Given the conductor's presence, there's no need to worry about it. However, it's crucial that we soon return to inform Pom-Pom about uh... the Nameless.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: What happened to you in Ena's dream?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: In my dream, the Express stopped at many places, and passengers came and went. However, the five of us were always present, and the journey seemed never-ending.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: Perhaps this could be a deep-seated desire inside me, and upon realizing this... I... I knew it wasn't real.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Is the Order incident in Penacony a unique case...?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: No related records exist in the data bank, but I have a theory: The hidden dangers of the Order have always been within the Harmony — And this issue existed within The Family from the very beginning.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: However, now that more powers in the universe are aware of this secret, the situation in the cosmos... will become more complicated.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: That's all for now.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: Like I said, we'll go and see. Once we've packed everything, we should head to our next destination.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Dan Heng]: It seems like you have other questions.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: This Trailblazing expedition has been thrilling and memorable. Hopefully we've all gained insights about ideals, paranoia, clarity, and dreams from the experiences we've had.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: What will happen to Sunday and Robin?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: One bird longs for the earth, and the other longs for the sky... Even if Robin had to stop her brother with her own hands, she won't give up on him.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: However, facing punishment from the Harmony is inevitable. He will face a trial. As for further details... The Family would rather not disclose them.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: When did the Order infiltrate Penacony?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Since The Family took up residence in Penacony, the Order has been hiding in plain sight under the guise of the Oak Family, using the Stellaron's power to strengthen their hold on the sweet dream, which eventually resulted in disaster.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: ...That's the claim The Family makes. Whether they were truly unaware of all this is a delicate matter.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Did the IPC make any move?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Aventurine's efforts finally earned the IPC a seat at the table. As a result, a more senior representative arrived in Penacony and initiated negotiations with The Family.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: As far as the Astral Express is concerned, the IPC will make for an invaluable ally during the negotiations to prevent Penacony returning to its former ways.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: What happened to you in Ena's dream?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Well, it was somewhat surprising. In that dream, I returned to my homeworld and reunited with my long-lost friends. And for some reason... Acheron resurfaced in my mind.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: When I realized that her "conclusion" was not preserved in memories, I became aware of the bitter truth.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: That's all for now.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: The conclusion of a journey can often be sorrowful. All we can do is try to make sure it ends on a happy note.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Is there anything else you'd like to ask, ?
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: Guess what! Something weird just happened when I was on my way over here. Someone gave me a strange gift.
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: So I unwrapped it and found out it was a button, with a message on the back: "Just press this button, and all of Penacony will explode!" Sounds terrifying!
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Could it be a terrorist attack?!
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: But who would launch such an obvious attack? They just want to stir up chaos.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Did you press it?
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: Of course not! Who would press something like that!
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: By the time I turned around, the person had already vanished. So I handed it over to a nearby hound. I heard there were many similar reports before the Charmony Festival started.
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: I'm really worried about the future of Penacony...
[Rivers Run Without Return][March 7th]: I'm really worried about the future of Penacony...
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Ready to mix your drink, ?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: What happened to Gallagher?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: I'm not sure. I haven't seen him since our last meeting at the lounge. Come to think of it, he always did come and go quietly.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: We used to discuss everything here. But every time he'd leave, I'd realize that I didn't know him at all. Such is the mystery that is Gallagher.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: I have a hunch... Perhaps he's already fulfilled his wishes and won't be coming back.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Let's mix the drinks.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Before we start, would you like to talk to your friends? We have plenty of time.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: No need. Let's get started.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Alright, as you wish.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: I think I have an idea about what drink to make. Would you like it bitter or sweet? It's up to you. Choose the flavor that suits you best at this moment.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Bitter.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Here's Bitter Dreams... the least popular drink in this bar. It's bitter and sour, just like the harsh realities of life.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Sweet.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Drowning Sweetness... one of the most challenging drinks to make. A slight imbalance in the ingredients can result in an overwhelmingly viscous, sweet taste.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: However, with the right ratios... you get a uniquely sweet drink with a lingering aftertaste.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Not a bad choice. Let's start mixing.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Great idea. I'll come back soon.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Just a moment. I'd like to talk to everyone.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Sure, we can wait – Gallagher included.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: ...This doesn't seem quite right. Don't worry. Let's give it another try.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Let me know when you're ready.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Ready for another try, ?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Let's begin.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Words always fall short. If you want to bring closure to past events at this lounge, there's no better way than mixing a drink.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Blend all your memories and emotions together and stir them well. Through the filter of time, what remains in the glass is something to savor.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Well, it's done...
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Here's to the Nameless resting in peace... and to my friend, Gallagher.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Death is a bitter truth, but what you did will be remembered by history.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: The spirit of freedom will spread far and wide among the stars, and its legacy will be more timeless than a pastoral song.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: We're not accepted by the outside world, so we've gathered here.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: And one day, our souls will return to the same place.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: ...Cheers.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Are you leaving? Then take this with you.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: /
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: I've mixed more of this last special drink for you. The past shouldn't be forgotten, so I hope it brings back the flavors of Penacony.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Welt]: Thank you. I'm sure it'll leave a lasting impression.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: If you happen to run into Gallagher, make sure he has a sip too. I know his tastes, and he'll be thrilled.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: We will.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: But what if we never cross paths with him?
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Then... I guess you won't be seeing him.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Alright, enough with the heavy stuff. You guys have important things to take care of, so let's not dwell on things.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: Whether it's the Astral Express or Penacony, there's still a long journey ahead. So, let's lift our spirits, guys.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Siobhan]: And embark towards our tomorrows.
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: Switching to Jade's POV...
[Rivers Run Without Return][Narration]: The meeting with Oti Alfalfa didn't start smoothly. Jade and Topaz are currently aboard the Radiant Feldspar discussing the strategy for the second half..

[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: ...Old Oti is a tricky opponent. I didn't expect him to take the risky step of "going public" at such a critical moment for Penacony.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Indeed, he's definitely bold. It's that kind of boldness that made him the Oti Alfalfa he is today.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Still, the outcome is uncertain. Shouting loud doesn't necessarily carry any weight. What about the phone call I asked you to make, Topaz?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Ah, they agreed, but it'll be some time before they arrive.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Just as it should be. The "sweet dew" should be served after the "bitter poison".
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Looks like we'll be skipping the "exchanging apples" step this time around.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Now that we're dealing with a greedy merchant, a simple apple wouldn't make a difference. Well, I guess I included myself in that remark too.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Now I'm a bit curious, Topaz. Do you think Penacony is a quality asset?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Yes, despite its recent calamity, Penacony remains a top-quality asset within the Cosmos, with good credit, lucrative potential, and promising prospects.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Well, that's obvious, but what I truly wanted to know is: This project is obviously too bland for your taste, isn't it?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: That's true. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Aventurine.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: But despite that, you trust him. You even entrusted him with a Cornerstone, something as precious as life itself, to finish this gamble.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Are you not in the same boat, Miss Jade? Without us playing along, your "Jade Stone" wouldn't have made it across the border so easily, allowing you to see all desires that flow through dreams to gain a bargaining chip in negotiations...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: That's why I'm willing to stake my "Topaz Stone" to cover for you... It's like one big elaborate game of chess.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Once that kid sets his mind to something, nothing can stop him, not even fate. Well, at least he's still alive, and that's the best outcome.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Looks like... we've strayed off-topic, Miss Jade. Should we discuss our next steps?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: No need. I'll go it alone. Meanwhile, you can go greet our honored guest and wait for my message.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Okay.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: 
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Greetings, Miss Robin. I didn't expect to meet you here.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: Miss Jade? Greetings. The opening ceremony for the Charmony Festival has been moved to the Radiant Feldspar, so I'm here making some preparations.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: How about you? Have you spoken with Mr. Alfalfa?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: I'm actually on my way to meet him right now. Do you know him well, Miss Robin?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: Unfortunately, I've never met him. I've only heard a few comments from the former head of the Oak Family... Mr. Alfalfa is respectable when it comes to business, but in other respects... I can't say the same.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Where do you think the future of the Planet of Festivities is headed?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: I believe the sweet dream will see its rebirth, just like the Radiant Feldspar resumed its voyage.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: The Harmony needs a new direction. Only by bidding farewell to the past can we actually sail into the future.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: There are no permanent allies or everlasting enemies. So, let's both... take what we need from this deal.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Naturally. I'm looking forward to your performance. See you at the Festival.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Robin]: See you later, Miss Jade.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Narration]: Start the second half of negotiations
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Thank you for your patience, Mr. Alfalfa. Let's continue our discussion.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Ohohoho, figured out something already, Miss Jade? Hmm... but where is Miss Topaz?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Topaz has something else to take care of, you'll be seeing her later. Talks can still continue between the two of us.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Is it just me, Miss? Your tone sounds... very different now.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: I need to set a good example for my junior. It's not a good habit to be too loose-lipped during negotiations, right?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Now, we can speak frankly and openly. Do you believe what I said, Oti? You're not the only merchant who has seen the changes in the cosmic market over the past ten Amber Eras.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Interesting... Ohohoho, now that's interesting.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Good! It's good to be straightforward! Openness and transparency are my things! So, tell me, what's your next move?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Unfortunately, I'd like to speak the harsh truth before laying out my plan. Let's cut to the chase. First, your plan won't work. Penacony has no way of sidestepping the IPC and going public.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Second, you can't stop the IPC from entering Penacony. We've got all the time and connections in the world to find a way in. We'll keep tearing down and rebuilding this place until the Asdana system gets used to the IPC's ways again.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Now I'm repeating your words exactly. If you don't want to be a laughingstock and have everyone gunning for you at the official conference... you'd better drop your little pie-in-the-sky plan.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Ohohohohoho! Interesting! Indeed!
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: You surely have a way with words! Now I'm curious to know what you have up your sleeve.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Mr. Alfalfa, let's not forget that the IPC controls the biggest interstellar publicity platform. More than half the news networks in the universe take their orders from us.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: The moment news spreads about Penacony going public, trillions of customers will immediately receive a message like this:
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: "The Family's protection for Penacony has expired. Any mishaps in the Dreamscape could result in permanent brain death."
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Care to guess how many ways we have to turn Alfalfa credits into worthless junk within a measly 24 system hours? With the entire cosmos keeping a close eye on Penacony, I assure you it won't be too hard.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: You really think you can pull that off?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Even from Pier Point, as distant as it may be, I'm more than capable of keeping you on a tight leash.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: However, if you agree to give up that half-baked plan to go public, the IPC will assure you that we'll never jeopardize the interests of the Family heads under your leadership.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: After all, we also need allies here in Asdana. The IPC can assist Penacony with financing —starting by acquiring 30% equity shares. With our financial support, stabilizing and rebuilding Penacony will be a piece of cake.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: 30% equity, you say? Who can guarantee you won't want more in the future?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Heh, that's the brilliant part of it all. The answer is simple: No one. There are no guarantees. It all hinges on self-awareness and mutual respect. However, the board of directors will consider the interests of the Family heads to some extent.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: You're a smart merchant, Old Oti. Isn't the whole purpose of this elaborate game to showcase your business acumen and seek more benefits for The Family?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: It benefits us if we both take a step back. And if that's not enough for you, I'm pretty sure that another goal of making Penacony go public is to expand the influence of the Planet of Festivities and attract more customers.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: I understand your concern, and I have a solution for that, too.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Fine, now I see your sincerity. As the head of the Alfalfa Family, I don't think I have any reason to refuse your offer...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: However, as THEIR chosen one, I still need one final answer.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Go ahead, I'm listening.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: When I was a child, I heard the adults recite the tale of the Ancient Amber Era, about the ascension of Xipe the Harmony, and the downfall of Ena the Order.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: The Order and the Preservation used to be close in ancient times. So why does the IPC, as a follower of the Amber Lord, seek collaboration with The Family instead of aligning with the Order?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: The answer is simpler than you think: It's all about credits, everyone's favorite thing and the universally recognized currency among the stars. The IPC has the power to perpetually ensure their value.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: With each new world integrated into the credit system, the IPC adds another building block to its cause. Eventually, all exchanges, capital, and businesses will operate within a unified monetary system.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: By then, all planetary developments will be recorded in accounts with well-defined values and the ability for exchange and circulation. And the heart of everything will be Qlipoth's "credit".
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: And then the IPC will be able to exert influence over everything.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Our intention is to establish enduring Preservation, so I'm sure you can understand...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: This universe doesn't need two types of Order.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: ...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Ohoho! Well said! Now you've convinced me.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Alright, tell me your solution. Let's see if we're thinking the same thing.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Then let's continue our conversation. Please, Topaz, invite "Sweet Dew" to join us at the table.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Thank you for your presence, Miss Himeko.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Please allow me to introduce her to you, Mr. Alfalfa. This is Miss Himeko from the Astral Express, one of the future shareholders of Penacony!
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Himeko]: I've heard so much about you, Mr. Alfalfa. It's an honor to meet you as representative of the Astral Express.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Old Oti]: Ohoho! This stunning lady is the navigator of the Astral Express? It's a pleasure to meet you.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: I believe everyone here is familiar with the general contents of the proposal. After this round of financing, the IPC is expected to hold 30% of Penacony's shares.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Then, the IPC will transfer 5% of that stake to the Astral Express and recommend Miss Himeko as an independent director to honor the sacrifices and contributions made by the former Nameless to the Land of the Dreams.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Himeko]: While this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the Trailblaze.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Himeko]: While the Nameless didn't embark on their journeys for fame or fortune, if this is the wish of both The Family and the IPC, I will represent the Astral Express and fulfill my duty as a member of the board of directors.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Himeko]: The entire Crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of Penacony. Beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the Planet of Festivities to more worlds.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Himeko]: Of course, all cooperation is based on one premise...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Himeko]: The Path of Harmony in Penacony must not be distorted again... and such a tragedy must never recur.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Narration]: After the negotiations...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Old Oti is in agreement, so the issue is settled, I presume. What about the remaining Family heads...?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: They will soon realize the situation. When Old Oti answered the last question, he represented more than just the Alfalfa Family.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: When should we schedule the formal negotiations? I'll handle the arrangements.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: It's all up to you. I'll step back and let you handle the negotiations and takeover. I won't be involved.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: But Miss Jade, this is...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Aventurine initiated this case, and you were his project partner. If that kid hadn't overplayed his hand, I wouldn't have been pushed to the forefront.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: I came here today to help you sort out the toughest issue. I trust you'll be able to wrap things up quite nicely, little Jelena.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: Of course, there won't be any problems. And please, give Diamond my assurance.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Don't worry. Diamond has always trusted us. I'll put in a good word for you, and you'll have your P45 position back in no time.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Radiant Feldspar... what a fantastic ship. Now that my business is done, it's time for me to indulge in my own little hobby.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: You want to open a Bonajade Exchange branch on this ship, too?
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Opportunities like this don't come around often. Just look at the guests on this ship. They're surely holding a wealth of valuable treasures.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Well, I'll take my leave. A pawnshop can't run without a boss. See you around, Topaz.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: I have one more question for you, Miss Jade.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Hmm? Go ahead.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Topaz]: That dose of "bitter poison"... I'm curious as to how you found this information.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: I didn't find the information. It came to me. It was from... a lady concerned with the future of the Harmony.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: In return, I've agreed to help her with something, but that's for later. We can deal with it after we leave Penacony.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: You see, that's what "investment" is all about. The seeds of opportunity are already sown, they only need a little bit of nourishment to take root. And then after, all we need to do is to wait patiently.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Jade]: Like right now for example. It's just about time my final "guest" boarded the ship.
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Narration]: Switching to Firefly's POV...
[Life is But a Drifting Dream][Narration]: At this moment, a dexterous "stowaway" also boards the Radiant Feldspar...

[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Skeptical Pepeshi]: A pawnshop that grants wishes...?
[Soldier's Pay][Skeptical Pepeshi]: Nah, sounds too good to be true.
[Soldier's Pay][Naive Intellitron]: If they can really grant my wish...
[Soldier's Pay][Naive Intellitron]: I wonder what they'll ask for in return?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ?)
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Robin]: ...By the way, there's one more thing.
[Soldier's Pay][Robin]: Mr. Alfalfa and I discussed it. I'll present a gift to the Astral Express on behalf of The Family as a token of gratitude for the Nameless' contributions to Penacony.
[Soldier's Pay][Robin]: Please help me with the necessary arrangements.
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Right away, Miss Robin.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Can I ask you something...
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Oh, greetings, miss. Is there anything I can help you with?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Do you know how to get to the pawnshop?
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: Pawnshop... Ah, you must be talking about Lady Bonajade's place, right? I heard she offers... special services there.
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: The Family's Attendant: I've marked the pawnshop's location on your device. Please feel free to check it out.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : If I win...
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : Your chest is mine!
[Soldier's Pay][Male Intellitron]: ...Who said I was betting with you?
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : I did!
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: , but I've got to find Lady Bonajade first.)
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: , but I've got to find Lady Bonajade first.)
[Soldier's Pay][Envious Lady]: Have you been to the pawnshop?
[Soldier's Pay][Frivolous Intellitron]: Yeah, sure.
[Soldier's Pay][Envious Lady]: What did you pawn?
[Soldier's Pay][Frivolous Intellitron]: Nothing, actually.
[Soldier's Pay][Envious Lady]: Then why did you go there?
[Soldier's Pay][Frivolous Intellitron]: Just to meet Lady Bonajade in person.
[Soldier's Pay][Envious Lady]: ...Come on, you're all the same!
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Welcome to Bonajade Exchange, Radiant Feldspar Branch.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: How should I address you, dear lady?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Just call me Samuel.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Samuel, nice name. So, what do you need, Miss Samuel? And what are you willing to give up in return?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ...
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: I want to keep on living. And for that, I'm willing to give up everything I have.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Everything you have?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: That's right, everything.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Miss Samuel, I think you'd best turn around. It seems you're not quite familiar with the term "pawn."
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: What do you mean?
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: I mean it literally. I sense your burning desire to live, but unfortunately, you don't have anything of equal value to offer.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Heh...
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Okay, "A pawnshop that grants wishes"... I see. It's just a marketing gimmick.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: That's quite a harsh accusation. I understand you may not fully comprehend what I mean, but don't worry, I'll help you understand.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Go and talk to these people. They're all customers of my pawnshop. See for yourself if their wishes have come true.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Once you've done that, come back to me. I'll help you understand the true meaning of "pawn" and make you realize what you're missing.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : Which one should I pop?
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : One, two, three, four, five...
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : Dan Heng and Voidranger jive...
[Soldier's Pay][Dan Heng]: Don't change the words.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: . I'll catch up with you later.)
[Soldier's Pay][Gambler]: Hahaha! You stupid little girl! Coming back to lose more money, huh?
[Soldier's Pay][Stacy]: Enough talk. Let's get started.
[Soldier's Pay][Stacy]: This will be our final game... I'm betting my entire fortune!
[Soldier's Pay][Gambler]: Oh? A big talker, huh? Alright, let's see what you've got!
[Soldier's Pay][Stacy]: I... I won? I actually... won?!
[Soldier's Pay][Gambler]: T-this... this can't be! You lost to me ten times in a row... How could I possibly lose to you at such a crucial moment?!
[Soldier's Pay][Stacy]: It's true... Lady Bonajade has truly blessed me...
[Soldier's Pay][Stacy]: Ha... Ha... Hahaha!! Finally, my luck has turned for the better! A great new era for Stacy the Master Gambler has arrived!
[Soldier's Pay][Dell]: I've prepared a gift for you, Dorothy. Check this out.
[Soldier's Pay][Dorothy]: Whoa... what a beautiful necklace! Is it made of cymophane? It's stunning...
[Soldier's Pay][Dorothy]: How did you know I love jewelry made of cymophane? It has the same purple hue as the necklace my dad gave my mom... I've never told anyone about it. How did you find out, Dell?
[Soldier's Pay][Dell]: So... so...
[Soldier's Pay][Dell]: Will... will you go out with me?
[Soldier's Pay][Dorothy]: ...
[Soldier's Pay][Dorothy]: I... I will!
[Soldier's Pay][Dell]: R-really?! I mean... really?
[Soldier's Pay][Dorothy]: I never said "yes" before because I thought you had no idea what I liked. But this gift made me realize you were actually paying attention all along, trying to learn everything about me... So, yes, I will.
[Soldier's Pay][Dell]: W-wonderful! My... my wish has actually come true!
[Soldier's Pay][Dell]: So, shall we go, Dorothy? Let's go outside and enjoy the stunning views of the Twelve Hours!
[Soldier's Pay][Dorothy]: Yeah, let's go!
[Soldier's Pay][Curious Woman]: Hey, did you see that?
[Soldier's Pay][Curious Woman]: The gray-haired one outside...
[Soldier's Pay][Careful Pepeshi]: Don't look around! Just focus on your drink!
[Soldier's Pay][Careful Pepeshi]: Seriously, they look like a total lunatic...
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ?)
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : Chirp, chirp...
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: : Origami bird... Hey, little birdie...
[Soldier's Pay][March 7th]: Come on...
[Soldier's Pay][March 7th]: Come on down already. Everyone's staring at you!
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: . I'll catch up with you later.)
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: . I'll catch up with you later.)
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: Yeah... you heard right. I've got him.
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: He's been hiding at the Moment of Sol in Penacony, using a fake identity. And he even posed as a professor at Paperfold academy.
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: I've made a deal with The Family. I'll leave the extradition-related paperwork to you.
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: ...How did I find him? Well... let's just say I had some help from an influential figure. Don't ask for all the details.
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: Twenty-two years... Twenty-two years of chasing this guy all over the Cosmos. Y'know, never thought it'd end up like this, right here...
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: I'm gonna hang up for now, partner... I need to raise a glass to myself.
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: Walker hangs up the phone, and a drop of fuel seeped out from his deep, metal-constructed eye sockets... those were the tears of an Intellitron
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: 
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: So, you're back, Miss Samuel.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Yeah, I found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the Bonajade Exchange.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: But I'm not sure what you want me to see. They all seem to be living... fulfilled lives.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Not so fast. This step was just to show you that the Bonajade Exchange is genuine, that I had the power to grant their wishes. And now, I'll tell you the price they paid.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Dell was from a wealthy family. He was head over heels for Dorothy and wanted to win her heart, so he made a deal with me. He put up his entire fortune in exchange for a gift that would impress Dorothy.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: It was a piece of cake for me, thanks to my IPC connections. However, Dell will soon find himself evicted from the Dreamscape because he can't afford his room. Whether he can bounce back from poverty... well, that depends on him.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Let's just hope that necklace will keep their relationship from crumbling.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Then there's Stacy, a lady with a gambling addiction. She wanted some serious luck, but she had nothing to offer, so I took something else instead. I took away all her close relationships.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: From the moment she stepped out of the Bonajade Exchange, every casino in the cosmos would remember her name, but her parents and siblings would sever ties with her, and it would be impossible for Stacy to make any real friends again.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: She will accrue a vast wealth due to her "good luck," but she'll never be able to use it for the people who truly matter to her.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: As for Detective Walker, he spent two decades chasing down a wanted criminal for some heinous crime, but he never caught the guy. In his desperation, he came to me.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: He offered his own memory system as collateral. In due time, his memories as a detective will be erased, and he will completely forget his own identity and all the sacrifices he has made.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Interesting, don't you think? I fulfill people's desires and grant them favors, and soon, they come back to me with even greater desires.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: When people see others' desires get fulfilled, they develop their own desires. It seems like an endless cycle but it does have a goal. In the end, I will get what I desire from this whirlpool.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: And patience happens to be one of my greatest strengths. So now, do you understand what you must give up, Miss Samuel? Or should I address you as...
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: AR-26710, a remnant of Glamoth's Iron Cavalry?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ...I'm not surprised.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: You are much calmer than I expected. Entropy Loss Syndrome... truly an unjust misfortune, isn't it?
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: The higher-ups in Glamoth implemented such a "fail-safe" within the genes of their warriors, just to make sure the Republic's most powerful weapons wouldn't fall into the wrong hands.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: As for the price... Those Iron Cavalries weren't exactly seen as regular, independent "humans," so there wasn't really a price to be paid.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: However, you are different. You're now a Stellaron Hunter, a living being named Firefly. Naturally, you want to continue your existence, but with the Firmament Front gone, the people who know the secret and can cure the disease are nowhere to be found.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Are you suggesting that the IPC has a remedy?
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Well, there might be a silver lining. That's all I can say for now.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: I see. It's no wonder you said I can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing I own holds any meaning...
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: So, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Unfortunately, that's not quite the case.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Partners... a nice way to put it. Now, I'm even more curious about the Stellaron Hunters. Each of you has your own identity and a special bond with each other. It's strong and intimate, and yet it allows for independence.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Just as the Ten Stonehearts follow Diamond, you follow your own leader. I wonder what they are like, and if all Stellaron Hunters are like you...
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Traveling on the Path of Finality but struggling against your destiny, attempting to move in the opposite direction?
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ...
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: I really hope that one day, all of you will come and visit my pawnshop. I'll be waiting patiently for that day.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: Can I see this as an invitation from Diamond to the Stellaron Hunters while keeping the IPC in the dark?
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Consider it more of a personal offer from myself. It doesn't represent the IPC or the Strategic Investment Department.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: The Stellaron Hunters have interacted with the IPC, but not the Ten Stonehearts... Our paths have never crossed. As for your offer, I can pass it along to my partners, but I have a question...
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: You know who I am, and you must know that my partner is keeping an eye on this room. If she wanted to, she could let the entirety of Pier Point know about it within a few mere seconds.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: What drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of Diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Simply put... you and I are the same.
[Soldier's Pay][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Soldier's Pay 4.mp4
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: However, unlike you Stellaron Hunters or the Astral Express, we band together... merely to obtain what we want.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Each of us has our own past and destined ends. And on this journey, we have been invited by Diamond to join him.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: This journey could be either brief or long, as each of us carries a void in our hearts that can only be filled from the outside.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: So, Diamond made us a promise. To divide the power of the Emanator of Preservation into ten pieces and give each of us a Cornerstone to fill that void.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: "Mortal flesh is fragile, yet my heart is unyielding like the monolith. For without this resolve, the way of Preservation would fade into oblivion."
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: So, you understand? This pledge goes beyond a mere oath. It's our collateral in exchange for opportunities, wealth, survival, and a future...
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: And whatever we gain from it will fortify the Stonehearts in return, allowing us to achieve the great cause of the Preservation when the war among the Aeons eventually comes.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ...
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: ...I understand.
[Soldier's Pay][Jade]: Take your time, child. You don't need to give me an immediate answer. Like I said, patience is one of my greatest strengths.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: If fate turns that page, our paths will cross again.
[Soldier's Pay][Firefly]: It's a shame, though, that this pawnshop can't give me what I desire. My last attempt in Penacony... Well, it ends with "hope."
[Soldier's Pay][Walker]: Lady Bonajade, I've come to deliver the collateral as promised.
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: Switching to Trailblazer's POV...
[Soldier's Pay][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: : Turns out, the meeting to decide the future of Penacony went much smoother than expected... with little debate.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: : The Charmony Festival's opening ceremony is starting soon. I should head down and take a look.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: ...Remember, I can take you out with just one shot whenever I choose.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: That'd be my honor... Don't worry. I hate cheating at the table.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Hmph... You better.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: Look who's here! The great hero of the Astral Express, the most dazzling  in all of Penacony!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Oh, you're here too? Long time no see, friend.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What are you guys whispering about?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: Merely a greeting of platitudes. As long as you and I have an understanding.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Do you always compliment everyone you meet, Aventurine?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: Merely a greeting of platitudes. As long as you and I have an understanding.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Why are you on the IPC's side now, cowboy?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: This fella... is also tracking down that son of a gun. What's that saying again? "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Let's set aside those under-the-table dealings for now, partner. Don't wanna spoil the festive mood of the Charmony Festival.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: I agree. Now let's congratulate  . I hear The Family intends to thank the crew at the Charmony Festival. *sigh* It's a real pity I can't personally be there to witness this.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You sure left in a hurry, Aventurine.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: My job was just to give the IPC an opening. Other things aside, I think I did a pretty good job at achieving this.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: While you were at Dreamflux Reef, we were actually close by. We wouldn't have been able to dig up so much dirty information without the help of a knowledgeable friend.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: But that Emanator didn't pull any punches... My body couldn't hold out too long, otherwise this would have been settled in a much cleaner manner.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'd like to thank you for all your help in the battle, cowboy.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Hah, no problem. Punishing the wicked and eradicating evil is a top priority, would've been strange if we sat it out.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Makin' an entrance like that, us Galaxy Rangers are makin' a comeback. Reckon you'll meet quite a few followers of The Hunt on your journey, do me a favor and pass on my regards will you?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What were you guys chatting about?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Forget it. I'm not one to beat around the bush. I've got a score to settle with a high-ranking executive fella named Oswaldo Schneider. And this flamboyant fella here can help me find him.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: The feud between the Marketing Development Department and the Strategic Investment Department is well-known across the cosmos. But what I didn't expect was the involvement of the Galaxy Rangers in this feud.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: Looks like... things are about to get spicy.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I hope you guys have fun at the festival.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: Thank you, and I also hope you enjoy yourself, great hero of Penacony!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Aventurine]: I'll pass, but I do hope you guys have fun. If you don't mind, let's play a few rounds next time.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Boothill]: It's time to let down our hair and enjoy ourselves on days like this — I hope you can enjoy yourself to the fullest, oh, great hero of Penacony!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, yes, I remember you. Your performance at Herta's space station was... adequate, I suppose.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Hm, no wonder that gambler likes you so much.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I didn't know you were here, too.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The Intelligentsia Guild assigned me to be an invigilator for the IPC's ambassadors. Hmph, nothing more than an errand from the Office of Academic Affairs.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Do you know Aventurine?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: This individual is my responsibility during the trip. Hmph, nothing more than an errand from the Office of Academic Affairs.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Can I please get your autograph, Dr. Ratio!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Do not try to emulate that gambler's penchant for attempting to be overly clever. I'll let it go this time, but this won't happen again.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Very well, the Charmony Festival is about to commence soon. Take advantage of this unique opportunity, a blend of work and play is essential for superior knowledge absorption.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: How do you rate Aventurine?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The executives of the IPC and the Guild say that we are strategic partners. Yet, from my perspective, I am invariably the teacher, and he, along with you and every other individual, is the student.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: From this perspective, Aventurine isn't what you'd call an ideal student, yet he's also not utterly obtuse. Alas, the void within him can never be filled by talent and knowledge. Let's hope he doesn't turn into a philosophical zombie.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I thought you were going to make me get my act together.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Ah, saying such a thing merely indicates that you have not truly grasped the essence of learning.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: The principle of balancing work and relaxation is scientifically grounded, with the relevant proof process detailed on page 21 of the 31467th issue of the academic journal Starseizer. Acquiring knowledge aims to enhance living. Don't invert priorities like those dolts at the Guild.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I hope you have fun at the festival.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: Hmph, then you'll excuse me.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dr. Ratio: I detest noisy gatherings, as they intrude upon my thoughts... What a waste of time.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Well if it isn't ? It hasn't been long, and yet here we are again. How are you?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Numby]: Oink... oink!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Life is as wonderful as ever.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Hah, that's what I thought! I heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the Oak Family in one fell swoop.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Such a pity I couldn't be there, or else I would have lent a helping hand.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Dead tired.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Hah, that's what I thought! I heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the Oak Family in one fell swoop.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Such a pity I couldn't be there, or else I would have lent a helping hand.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'm in the mood for a job change.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Hmm? So direct. Aren't you afraid I might take you seriously?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Thinking about it though, the lives of the Nameless are so excessively exciting. I heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the Oak Family in one fell swoop.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: If one day you're tired and looking for a change in work environment or you want a desk job, just contact me!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Look at how bustling this ship is, not bad! Someday when I'm less tied up, I plan to host a grand party on my eco-ship, and you'll all be on the guest list.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I wanna ask you a question about that transform...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: ...Are you also able to transform yourself?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Trans... form? What are you saying?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Oh... I understand now. You're referring to Aventurine's Cornerstone right? Sorry, compared to him, my ability is not as "visual."
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Guess there's no harm telling you. The abilities of the Ten Stonehearts' cornerstones are all different. Some can even read your thoughts, grasp your desires... So be careful...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Now that I think about it, it was good that Bronya got there when she did in Belobog — if she came any later, we probably wouldn't have ended up as friends~
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Topaz]: Look at how bustling this ship is, not bad! Someday when I'm less tied up, I plan to host a grand party on my eco-ship, and you'll be on the guest list.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: Hey there, lively ! Welcome to the Bonajade Exchange.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: What should I call you?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: My name is .
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: What a unique name.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: So,  , what do you wish for? And what are you willing to sacrifice for it?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: My name is March 7th.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: No problem. Let's just use this name.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: So,  March 7th — What do you wish for? And what are you willing to sacrifice for it?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: My name is... Sunday.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: Hmm... Not a bad name, just lacking in virtue.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: So,  Sunday, what do you wish for? And what are you willing to sacrifice for it?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Make Nanook bow down to me!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I want to be the CEO of the IPC!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Revive Akivili!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: Oh... This is your wish?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Lady Bonajade doesn't even blink. You're guessing she doesn't have any sense of humor.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: Sounds simple enough. Very pragmatic. Then, let's discuss the cost.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'm listening...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: No way. This is the endgame already?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: I wouldn't be too worried.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: To fulfill this wish, the thing I need is simple: The tail of an animal.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sounds easy enough.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What animal?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: Well, it's a two-legged animal... With black fur, a round head, and long ears, it's omnivorous and is prone to mood swings. Most importantly, it has mastered the human language and can communicate.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: Bring its tail to me as collateral and your dreams will come true.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: It seems that "Lady Bonajade" is not without a sense of humor... You have to admit, her skill in using dark humor is superior to yours.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: ...Hopefully, there are scissors on the Express.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: May fate bring us together again,  .
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Jade]: May fate bring us together again,  .
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Lady Bonajade stares at you, seemingly piercing through all your desires and thoughts.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: We meet again, my dear friend. Your journey of the Beauty is even more elegant than mine. My most sincere regards to you!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sincere regards to you too, dear friend.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: Even after achieving such remarkable feats, you remain humble and gentle... Such is the true mark of knightly grace!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You flatter me too much...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: How could it be? The Beauty holds no bias. My words are fair and just.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: When will I be able to unlock a new Path then?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: Unlock? An eloquent and picturesque choice of words, yet you have already set forth on the Path of Beauty
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: I have heard of your valiant deed in leading others to vanquish the Omen of Evil. Though the tale bears a tinge of regret, you have undoubtedly championed Beauty and justice. May Idrila smile upon you.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The Omen of Evil?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: If an admirer of the Beauty gets lost in the pursuit of power, they risk descending into "the Omen of Evil," a form which is neither human nor beast.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: Although Mr. Sunday did not cross paths with the Path of Beauty, his actions were no different from the Omen of Evil. A lamentable soul lost on the path of righteousness... truly a matter of deep regret.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Why were you not there during the final battle?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: I'm ashamed to admit, Ena's dream was too realistic. I couldn't bear to bid farewell to a fallen friend, who had long turned into a beast. I lingered in that illusory dream for far too long... Ah, his voice and smile were too vivid.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: I didn't pass the trial of Beauty this time, spending much time in self-reflection over my own hesitation. Yet I wish for Idrila to remain my beacon, a banner for me to strengthen my determination for the Beauty.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I hope you have fun at the festival.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: Thank you, and may the Beauty always be with you!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Argenti]: Thank you, and may the Beauty always be with you!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][???]: Hi, we meet again.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: It's really you. I knew I didn't get the wrong person.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You saw me?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Yes, it's just I didn't get the chance to say hello. There's still some time before Charmony Festival starts. Do you want to chat?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You mistook some else for me?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: It was you. I saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the Dreamy Slots. I don't think I'm mistaken... right?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: There's still some time before Charmony Festival starts. Do you want to chat?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You walk and talk with Firefly, stopping in your tracks when more comes into view.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: ...Two murder cases, a showdown with the IPC's ambassadors, the legacy of the Nameless, and a remnant of the Order who wishes to replace an Aeon-created paradise with a dream — you guys even ended up shattering the dream... It's truly been quite a vacation.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: It's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. Congratulations! After the Charmony Festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I don't know where our next destination will be.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'm not sure if we'll be able to depart smoothly.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: There will always be somewhere. After all, you guys are on the Path of the Trailblaze...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Before joining the Stellaron Hunters, Elio told me that this journey will tell me how to live on. That's all he said. As for the rest, it's up to me to find out.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: So, I'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. This trip to Penacony is no different.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: No wonder you were interested in investigating the Watchmaker.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Yes... sadly I was looking in the wrong place. But I did reap some rewards.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Looks like you didn't get what you wanted this time.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Yes... Initially, I thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the Watchmaker. I was looking in the wrong place, but I did reap some rewards.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Do you know Miss Jade from the IPC's Strategic Investment Department? Bonajade Exchange belongs to her.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: She told me her price, but...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Did you take the deal?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: No. But what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Don't take the deal. Those IPC people may have ulterior motives.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: I know. But what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Of course I want to live on, but... what fate owes me, I want it paid back, not passed on. No one else should be involved, because this is a grudge between me and fate.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Ah, speaking of which... Actually, I feel that I still owe you a formal apology, for... that matter with "the performer of the Iris Family."
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Even the smallest of lies can turn into a betrayal as sharp as a blade... I'm sorry, .
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I never felt hurt by this.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Really? Then it seems... what Kafka taught me was correct.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: No problem. You've already apologized.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: It was an emergency, so I never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, I was the one to blame.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You shouldn't have lied to me in the beginning.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Yes, and for that, I'm sorry.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: To me, hiding is much easier than being honest... yet, I still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Composed Bloodhound Family Member]: It's that girl! Get moving! Arrest that criminal before the Charmony Festival's opening ceremony starts!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: I can't believe they've chased me this far... Looks like we'll have to say our goodbyes. Don't worry about me. Just go and enjoy the ceremony!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: The "script" hasn't reached its end yet — we will meet again!

[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: MessagesFireflyFireflyIt's me, FireflyI've got it all handledDon't worry. I didn't do anything rash. I've hidden myself awayIt's a pity I won't be able to see Miss Robin perform...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Some time later...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Guests]: Wow, it's Miss Robin!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Guests]: Miss Robin! Miss Robin! Marry me, Miss Robin! Glory to The Family! Glory to The Family!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: Distinguished guests, fellow Family members, ladies, gentlemen and friends from all over the cosmos —
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: It's a pleasure to join you all in celebrating the grandest ceremony of the Amber Era, the Charmony Festival. Firstly, on behalf of the Penacony Family's five major lineages...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: And on behalf... of myself, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all our guests!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: As you all may have noticed, this year's Charmony Festival is far from regular. Thanks to the efforts of everyone, this celebration is unprecedented in scale, with factions from across the cosmos in attendance...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: Not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the Penacony Grand Theater has now moved to the Radiant Feldspar — the very airship you all stand upon.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: We invite you to express your warmest applause and deepest appreciation for Oti Alfalfa — head of the Alfalfa Family — for his selfless devotion to the Harmony's cause!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: What makes this festival so uniquely significant? As is widely known, the Radiant Feldspar had to halt its voyage due to an anomaly in the sweet dream, sparking widespread discussion in the Twelve Hours...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: But thanks to the hard work of Penacony's internal and external factions, we've finally gotten the Dreamscape back on track, just in time for the Charmony Festival. And as they say, good things come in pairs. The Charmony Festival not only celebrates this achievement but also marks the relaunch of the Radiant Feldspar.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: And finally, the last reason. Does everyone remember the Watchmaker? In truth, The Family has poured their efforts into this festival just to commemorate this legendary luminary...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: The father of Penacony, Mikhail Char Legwork, one of the legendary Nameless who laid the foundations of Penacony!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: In the most bewildering times of the Planet of Festivities, it was he who descended from the sky with his companions, who taught us through Trailblazing where freedom lies. It was also they who led the vanguard in the pioneering of the Dreamscape, in exchange for what is now known as the paradise of Harmony.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: It can be said that Penacony's splendid success today is deeply rooted in the Trailblazing ethos the Watchmaker planted within us. Only by honoring this Trailblazing spirit can we fulfill our mission and spread Harmony to a broader audience.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][March 7th]: Aww... That's so nice of her. She's talking about us!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: We haven't even been mentioned yet...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][March 7th]: Oh, come on! It doesn't matter if she's talking about the old or new generation, we're all still a part of the Astral Express family!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Our Trailblazing spirit is unparalleled!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][March 7th]: That's right! Unparalleled!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The Express crew would've been disbanded long ago if it weren't for you!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][March 7th]: Obviously! Wait! Why does that seem so ominous...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: And now the sweet dream is back on track, all thanks to the Trailblaze, of course. If it weren't for everyone on the Astral Express, we wouldn't be able to successfully host this Charmony Festival.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: Thus, with unanimous consent from the five major lineages, Penacony's Family — on behalf of all family members throughout the cosmos, offer a token of appreciation to the Nameless.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][March 7th]: Oooh... I wonder if it's gonna be a big one?!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: ...We will transfer ownership of the Radiant Feldspar to the Astral Express! A meager appreciation that we hope you will accept with grace.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: Let us gift our applause and cheers to these brave and dauntless Nameless!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Guests]: Nameless! Nameless! Nameless!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: And now, I propose a toast...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: To Harmony, to the Trailblaze, to the future of Penacony and the universe, and to the generous Alfalfa Family Head, Mr. Oti Alfalfa...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Robin]: ...Cheers!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Old Oti]: To make a decision like that... This little bird is no less capable than her brother!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Sparkle]: All's well that ends well... right?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Sparkle]: But have you forgotten someone, my gray-haired friend?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Sparkle]: I put a bomb on this ship.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Sparkle]: You have ten minutes to find it — better hurry!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sparkle's Wondrous Treasure Map
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Miss Sparkle thoughtfully marked the locations of  imaginary neutron bombs for you — she's just too kind!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Where are the rest of them, you ask? Just take a few strolls around on this luxury airship~
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: You've finally arrived, O great gray haired little one! I am the constable around these parts, and right now I'm posing as a bomb!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You're not very good at character design, are you?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: What do you know? This is called foreshadowing!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Bombs are playable characters now?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: You don't like it? Fine. I'm now the Bomb Demon then.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Bomb Devil" Doll: Satisfied? If not, you'll just have to make do. All right. Now that you've found me, it's my turn to complete my mission. Next, I'll count down from five, and then explode!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Bomb Devil" Doll: Five...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Bomb Devil" Doll: Four...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Bomb Devil" Doll: One...!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Where's three?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Where's two?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Bomb Devil" Doll: Did I miss a number? Oh, so I did. No matter though, I've never learned how to count before — I mean, Bomb Demon doll has never learned how to count.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Bomb Devil" Doll: I'm not even a real bomb! Was it surprising, shocking, horrifying? No? Really? Fine. That's too bad then. You really ought to learn how to win a girl over!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Great gray haired little one? So am I great, or little?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: I'm about to explode, and that's all you're concerned about?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: All right. Now that you've found me, it's my turn to complete my mission. Next, I'll count down from five, and then explode!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: Five...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: Four...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: One...!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Where's three?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Where's two?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: Is it really that important? I'm not even a real bomb!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Constable" Doll: Was it surprising, shocking, horrifying? No? Really? Fine. That's too bad then. You really ought to learn how to win a girl over!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: This "Constable" Doll finally falls silent. You open it up  and uncover its true nature — a mere toy equipped with a remote speaker.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: Oh, by the Laughter, to think you've seen through my disguise this quickly! Honestly, my dear  Gray Hair, you're just like that ferocious pangolin in Madam Susan's bedroom!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Enough talk, let me defuse the bomb!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: Keep your shirt on! A watched pot never boils, !
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What exactly have I seen through...?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: Oh my, your acting prowess is almost on par with Miss Sparkle! But you still can't fool me!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Why does she have a pangolin in her bedroom?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: Hmph, how shameful! Did Uncle Parker not teach you properly? One must pose appropriate questions at the appropriate time!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: I'm on to you! You're here because you accepted bribes from the duplicitous and corrupt leader of that Sparkle Gang, the scoundrel who wants to become mayor of Sparkle City — Blazin' Bro!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: This evil city has fallen into depravity! As the Sheriff Doll, I cannot idly stand by and do nothing! And now, only this imaginary neutron bomb can completely cleanse Sparkle City of your ilk!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: If you wish to defeat me, you'll have to face off against the great Sparkle's dogs — they're my fiercely loyal companions, and you'll never defeat them!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Sheriff" Doll: To think I was defeated by the despicable underling of Blazin' Bro... You'll never get away with this. Because I'm just an adorable doll, not some imaginary neutron bomb!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The "Sheriff" doll lets out a long sigh and, with its exquisite acting, feigns death. Unfortunately, the imaginary neutron bomb isn't here, it's best to look elsewhere.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Ha, we meet again, . I am Penacony's famed detective.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Got yourself into a pickle? I'm more than happy to help, but unfortunately, I'm preoccupied with a couple of unsolved cases... So, you'll have to wait your turn.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I just need that bomb in your hands.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You're telling me your case is related to the bomb?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I need your help finding a bomb.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Bomb? Drat... It completely slipped my mind: Dr. Boom specializes in explosives!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: I need your help,  . You've had quite a few run-ins with Dr. Boom, and with the recent bomb situation, you're bound to find evidence that proves Dr. Boom is the killer.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: The first case is the SoulGlad factory arson case. We found a hammer, a doll and half a liter of an unidentified fluid at the scene of the crime. Our forensics results showed it's a red herring.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: The second case is the Blue Hour auction robbery. A gang of masked thugs broke in, stole a fragment of the Astral Express, and left behind a large hammer, a doll, and a half-dead red herring at the scene.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Those are all the details. The way I see it, there must be a link between these two cases that will be key to exposing Dr. Boom.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: I trust in your deduction. Which piece of evidence do you think is the deciding one?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The hammer...?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Bzzt — Wrong answer! The hammer is a murder weapon, but these two cases aren't murder cases!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Oh Gray Hair, Gray Hair, it's been so long, but you haven't changed at all. I'm sorely disappointed...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: But, seeing as you've put in so much effort, I'll throw you a bone: The bomb's not here. This is only a prank I've craftily set up. Hurry, time's running out. You'd better find that real bomb quickly!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The doll...?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Bzzt — Wrong answer! The dolls at the two scenes are modeled after Dr. Boom and Dr. Bloom respectively — they're not the same!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Oh Gray Hair, Gray Hair, it's been so long, but you haven't changed at all. I'm sorely disappointed...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: But, seeing as you've put in so much effort, I'll throw you a bone: The bomb's not here. This is only a prank I've craftily set up. Hurry, time's running out. You'd better find that real bomb quickly!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The red herring...?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Bzzt — Wrong answer! A "red herring" is a fake clue to misdirect. It's not meant to be evidence!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Oh Gray Hair, Gray Hair, it's been so long, but you haven't changed at all. I'm sorely disappointed...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: But, seeing as you've put in so much effort, I'll throw you a bone: The bomb's not here. This is only a prank I've craftily set up. Hurry, time's running out. You'd better find that real bomb quickly!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The bomb...?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Bzzt — Wrong answer! These two cases don't mention bombs. Are you imagining things?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Oh Gray Hair, Gray Hair, it's been so long, but you haven't changed at all. I'm sorely disappointed...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: But, seeing as you've put in so much effort, I'll throw you a bone: The bomb's not here. This is only a prank I've craftily set up. Hurry, time's running out. You'd better find that real bomb quickly!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: It's you! You were at both crime scenes!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Bing bing — Correct answer! You're good, Gray Hair. Your mind is pretty sharp!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Detective" Doll: Seeing as you've put in so much effort, I'll throw you a bone: The bomb's not here, this is only a prank I've craftily set up. Hurry, time's running out. You'd better find that real bomb quickly!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sparkle's voice faded, leaving behind the doll's body buzzing with white noise. It seems this pitiful doll was transformed into a megaphone by Sparkle.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: Welcome, human. I am an Aeonic Intelligence Droidhead answering machine, also very likely an imaginary neutron bomb.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: If you can answer the only question I have for you correctly, you can open up my lid to check if I'm really a bomb or not. If I am, I will initiate my automated shutdown sequence to avert danger.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Bring it on!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: Fortune favors the bold, and I respect you for it.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: It's not gonna be that same old riddle again, is it...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: I'll be honest and tell you: It's not.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You're obviously just a trash can.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: You have to look past the surface to see my true essence, and my essence is within this can.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: Listen up! What creature has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: People.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Bugs.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sweet Dreams Troupe.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: A trashcan.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sparkle, it's Sparkle!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: Correct answer! But, it's a shame...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Trashcan" Doll: I hate smartypants!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: Hello, I'm a bomb! There's still some time before I explode, so you can take a look around first!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'm here to defuse you.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: Defuse? No problem! Executing self-defusing program — this won't take long!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: All right. I'll go take a look around then.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: That's no problem of course! But if you don't want to go too far, I can also play a soothing tune for you in case you get bored!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Can I just wait around here for a moment?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: We do not have this function called "Wait Around"! But it's no problem — to ease any boredom during your wait, I can play a soothing song for you!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: Now playing Never Give Up, Never Surrender by the trending superstar Ast Rickley from the Epsilon XII System...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: ...Oh, hang on, Penacony's Family have not purchased the rights to this song — we can't play it here. How about this, I'll recite it for you — next up, please enjoy a recital of Never Give Up, Never Surrender!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: "O Aha! If you ask me how I feel about you, don't tell me that you pretend not to see!"
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: "THEY will never give you up, never make you sad! THEY will never give you up, never make you cry!"
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Fool" Doll: "THEY will never say goodbye to you, never tell lies to hurt you — praise Aha!"
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: After the almost tearful exclamation of "Praise Aha!" comes to pass, all that's left in the doll's mouth is that lingering echoes of an irritating cassette tape. Turns out that it isn't a bomb after all, but a vintage tape recorder.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Welcome to the Radiant Feldspar, good ! I am a dangerous bomb, and an outlaw who despises law and order. May you have a splendid day!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You're pretty polite.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Thank you, , but courtesy doesn't hide my hazardous lunacy. If you're unconvinced, let me show you: Go fudge yourself, you muddle-fudger!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'm guessing you're also not a real bomb.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: I'm not, but so what? I'm still crazy and dangerous. In case you don't believe me, allow me to show you: Go fudge yourself, you muddle-fudger!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You don't look or sound that dangerous.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Really? Fork you. If you think this isn't intense enough, I don't mind showing you what real danger and madness look like.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: To be frank, I didn't become an outlaw because I'm a fudgin' bomb. It's because I'm the fudgin' owner of an ancient, mad, forbidden curse.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Care to experience it? I can chant it for you, but Miss Sparkle won't be responsible for any of the consequences.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Let's see what you've got!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Holy fudge, you're more insane than I am! Let me gather my wits...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Forget it. I value my life too much.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Oh? You scared, lil' fudgehead? It's too late, I tell you! You've already opened Pandora's box...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: ...The ritual is ready. Perk up your ears and listen closely to the most ancient, primal fear etched into the very fudgin' genes of humanity—
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Outlaw" Doll: Bloomska, boomska, little sparkleeesss!!! Bloomska, boomska, little sparkleeesss!!!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The striking resemblance to the voice of the legendary Penaconian cartoon character "Clockie" instantly rings an alarm within you! The profound muscle memory from ancient times prompts you to swing your arms in a wide arc, catapulting the doll into the heavens.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: If the doll's words just now are not false, then indeed there won't be an imaginary neutron bomb exploding on the surface at Golden Hour. No need to worry...?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: Hello, human. We meet again. I never thought I'd see you here.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: I'm currently on this luxury cruise ship enjoying Penacony's consumer-friendly sugar-coated cannonballs. What about you? Are you just seeing the sights?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: I'm here to defuse a bomb.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: Bomb? Gosh, I'm not a bomb.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Have we met somewhere?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: If you've been to the Xianzhou Luofu, it's likely we've met.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You remind me of an old acquaintance.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: Old acquaintance? I'm not even human.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: I'm a heliobus, originally from the Luofu's Fyxestroll Garden. I'm passionate about researching Xianzhou subcultures, but I've slowly come to realize that Xianzhou subcultures also have their limits.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: I forgot what happened, but anyway, I ended up in Penacony. I wanted to study a subculture that is completely different from the Xianzhou's, and boy it's really been an eye-opening experience — that is, if I had eyes.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: I've come to realize, the people here don't treat subcultures as actual culture. They call them me... me...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Memes?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Mesmerizing antagonists?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: Yes meme, that's it. They even have forms. I'm good friends with a meme with sharp teeth and claws. It's very interested in the Xianzhou Vidyadhara culture. I gave it a Xianzhou name, and it was delighted.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: Oh, speaking of which, I should go and look for it. Memey the Monster has an explosive temper, and it's never been very patient.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Memey the Imp" Doll: I hope you can find the real sugar-coated cannonball — I mean, bomb. Bye bye!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: A wisp of green smoke emerges from the doll's body, and then it lies motionless. It seems this isn't a real imaginary neutron bomb either.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: Hello, lovely actor. You can call me the Director Doll. I often use this name in film credits.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: If you didn't know, I'm the one who directed the entire farce in Penacony. As the leading  of the show, what did you think? Feel free to share your thoughts...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: ...Well, actually, due to current plot requirements, you're only allowed to say one line. So, please try and resist the urge to share your thoughts.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Right now, I just want to defuse the bomb and advance the plot.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: Really? You really have no questions? Okay then, what a pity.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You're the one who made Sunday a villain?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: Sunday? Who's that?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What about the action scene where Acheron had to escape The Family?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: Acheron? Who's that?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What happened to Robin's journey of uncovering the truth?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: Robin? Who's that?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You have way too many storyline transitions!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: *sigh* It's all my fault for being duped by the Masked Fools! This screenplay was written by someone named "Miss Sparkle". She said she graduated from Sparkle University's Film Directing and Screenwriting program, so we instantly hit it off...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: ...Who knew that there was no such thing as the "Film Directing and Screenwriting program" at Sparkle University — in fact, Sparkle University isn't even real! Bah, Sparkle.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: Since you're done asking questions, and I'm done answering... according to the script, I must reveal to you the fact that there's no bomb here at all, thus causing you to want to kick yourself for spending this whole time listening to me prattling on, after which we will part ways.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Director" Doll: But don't fret! I've also prepared a gift for you — a dream bubble that has the thrilling life-and-death moments I shared with a beautiful Memokeeper! If you haven't seen it yet, you should hurry up and look for Dr. Edward.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The harmless chatterbox plush doll bows affectionately to you, blowing you a kiss before bounding away, vanishing into the depths of the cabin with joyful leaps.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Origami" Doll: Yahaha! So you've found me... Uh, no, I meant to say "thank you", tweet!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You're a bomb?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Origami" Doll: What... You can't tell? I'm the Origami Doll, tweet!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Don't speak out of turn.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Origami" Doll: I-I just got the parts mixed up! Please don't tell anyone, tweet.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: So you're the Origami Bird now then?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Origami" Doll: Origami Bird? Can't you tell? I'm the Origami Doll, tweet!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Origami" Doll: Actually, there are 998 more dolls that can pack a punch just like me on the Radiant Feldspar, tweet. Please call them back to the Golden Sparkle Tree. I will prepare a worthy gift for your troubles, tweet!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "Origami" Doll: As for that imaginary neutron bomb you want... Uh, don't interrupt me. I know you never mentioned those three words to me before... Well, the bomb isn't here, tweet! I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere for it.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: The peculiar doll flicks its twin ponytails and vanishes into the sky of dreamscape, a sight much more thrilling than an Origami Bird. As for the "Golden Sparkle Tree"... forget about it, most likely just some random balderdash that Sparkle made up.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: :
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "True Bomb" Doll: Twenty-eight minutes forty-six seconds... Twenty-eight minutes forty-five seconds...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: ...Ah, you're here!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: How's the bomb situation?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Looks like she also sent you a message...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: You were also summoned here by the Masked Fools?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: The Masked Fools... So this really was their doing.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Sparkle, eat my bat!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Don't come close. This bomb is very dangerous! And... I'm the real Firefly!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Since you're here... I'll just keep it short. Just over half an hour ago, I received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as I could.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "True Bomb" Doll: Twenty-seven minutes fifty-two seconds... Twenty-seven minutes fifty-one seconds...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: The sweet dream has lost the protection of the Order — if it were to blow up here... the consequences would be unfathomable. I've scrutinized it for a long time, but the bomb's design is incredibly unique, as if it's been locked by some mysterious Path force...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Apart from its creator, I fear no one knows how to deactivate it.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Then we'll just have to find that person!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: It's difficult. Time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. And even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Don't panic. There are still many people on their way.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: You mean the Watchmaker's guests? That's a pity... Based on my experience, I don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: The Memokeeper may be able to teleport the bomb to a deserted location, but... I've found a note inside the doll.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: This_is_a_memetic_virus.exe
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: !!!WARNING!!!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: A memetic virus has been planted into this imaginary neutron bomb
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Memetic lifeforms  are advised to stay clear

[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: P.S.: She means business.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: P.S.P.S.: It's true! Try it if you dare!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: I don't know what grudges they have... but this path is a dead end, too.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Mommy... I don't wanna die...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: ...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Is there another way?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: So that's it? There's no other way?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Actually... there might be another way.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Do you still remember? The script said that I will experience "death" three times in the Land of Dreams.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: I think this moment heralds the third time.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What's your plan?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Like I said earlier — now's not the time for the plot payoff!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: You may already know that I have no way of evoking dreams — I employ a Stellaron Hunter's special method in order to enter dreams instead. This allows me to perform feats that typical Dreamchasers can't.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: As long as I can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, I'll be able to dive into the primal Memory Zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the Radiant Feldspar.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: I will take this bomb into the depths of the Dreamscape... as deep as possible, where there are no living souls around. That way, at least no one will get hurt.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: What about you?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: Can you really make it in time?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: This matter can't just be left to the Stellaron Hunters.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Don't worry. I believe that this Fyrefly Armor will be enough to take me to where I need to go before the countdown ends... and maybe even make it back safely.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: At present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. After all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: I have some words to share with you, though they were spoken to me by Miss Acheron. She said that "The so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen..."
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: At the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible... but are they really never going to happen? Maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Whether it be a literal ending, suffering akin to death, or a harrowing deathscape... Before the appointed destination arrives, they are all the same, yet I can still make myriad choices. I also firmly believe that...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: That when that moment arrives for us to make a choice, the answer to our end will already be within our hearts
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: It is not destiny that shapes us, but we who shape destiny.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: The Astral Express and the Stellaron Hunters... are like light and shadow.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: We walk on different paths, intertwined, moving forward and growing together...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Maybe the end is predestined, but... it is not today.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "True Bomb" Doll: Since things are going too well...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Narration]: "True Bomb" Doll: Let's speed up the countdown!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Human life is short, just like fyreflies [sic] to a flame. So, if you have an answer in your heart...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Always remember, don't leave with any regrets.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: We have this right... don't we?
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Sparkle]: Since you care so much about other people's safety —
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Sparkle]: Why don't you go take a closer look!
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: You see, everything is possible in this land of dreams.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: We each came here with our own goals, and realized them in unimaginable ways.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Regardless if the result was a sweet illusion or a bitter reality, it was an answer we longed for day and night.
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: So, why do people choose to slumber? I think it's as you said...
[A Thousand Bells at Dawn][Firefly]: Because in the end, we will wake up from our dreams.

[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: When I arrived, I happened to see a child holding it. He said the flowers were prepared by Aunt Jessie, for the Watchmaker, and the war comrade he'd missed his whole life.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Mikhail would place two bunches of flowers here year after year. And, after he left, it became three.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Your wishes will always be remembered by someone.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Now, Penacony as you hoped, has welcomed the dawn after a long, dark night. The path forward may not be a bed of roses, but at least people are prepared to step forth towards freedom.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Tiernan, you can now go home.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: While the Nameless are also preparing for the next stop of their voyage.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: But before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: To say goodbye to you.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: It is my honor. I've said many goodbyes. Yet I am glad, that this is the first time I speak those words with a smile.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: But before leaving, I'm sure you all have plenty to say to the Nameless of the past?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: We've come to say goodbye to Gallagher.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Looks like you've also noticed that history fictionologist is nowhere to be found in Penacony, disappearing just as quietly as when he first showed up.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: I believe he must have come here at the end, to bid farewell to his Nameless friends. Similarly, I'm sure you all have plenty you want to say to them.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: We've come to say goodbye to the old Nameless.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: A fitting end to the tale of the departed — one could not ask for a better farewell. Go on, they're all here.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: A fitting end to the tale of the departed — one could not ask for a better farewell. Go on, they're all here.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Honestly, when I heard the conductor's request, I was pretty surprised.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: The Nameless — Those who Trailblaze, doing good deeds but never seeking recognition. After all this time, how would we even find those three people in such a vast place like Penacony?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: But it seems... in the Land of the Dreams, anything is indeed possible.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: History may not remember the names of the dead, but the stars will attest to their journeys.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: The first glimmer of light in the prolonged night often illuminates little, as it is fleeting and the darkness too vast.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: But because of this, people will remember: As long as something shines in the night sky, then when the first star falls... countless more will follow, streaking across the horizon.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: A toast.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: /
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: Breukelen Tiernan, Razalina Jane Estella, we raise a toast to you, Trailblazers of the silver rail...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: ...A toast to history that no longer remains silent, the passionate and courageous pursuit, and a voyage that traverses the stars.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: That statue... It wasn't here last time.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: Looks like this is the last riddle that Mr. Gallagher left for us.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: In the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: What should I say... I mean this guy is definitely a history fictionologist all right. I'm suddenly reminded of the time at the theme park when he said he was only thirteen years old. Could that have meant something, too?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: At least our journey together in Penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land... must have been real too, right?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: A toast.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: /
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering Hound...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...To the festival's invitation, to all lies, and the singular truth...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...If we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Micah]: Is the Astral Express ready to depart Penacony?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Apologies, Mr. Micah, that we are only now bidding you farewell.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Micah]: Oh, that's alright. You've all done so much for the Watchmaker, and we are forever indebted. Allow me, as the representative of Dreamflux Reef, to make another toast to all the Nameless.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: What will the people of Dreamflux Reef do now?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Micah]: Many will continue to live here. Those accustomed to being awake will mostly have a hard time getting used to a life of darkness with their eyes closed. Though the Order has faded, there must be someone to watch over this primal Memory Zone.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Micah]: Penacony's nights are long, and there are many who are still far from a good night's sleep. As for the sweet dream over there...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Micah]: We're still managing without it, aren't we?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: A toast.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: /
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Micah, and residents of Dreamflux Reef, we raise a toast to you, watchers of the long dream...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: ...To your tenacity throughout time, to each sorrowful night, and to the dawn that is finally upon us.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: In the end, we still came full circle.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: This Trailblazing expedition started from the moment  and a bellboy ran into each other. After going on a journey of many twists and turns, they still ended up where they started.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: Just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock — the advent of time moving forward.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: There shouldn't be much left to say. This entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: And then, a new page will be turned.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: A toast.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: /
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: Mikhail Char Legwork, we raise a toast to you, Watchmaker of the Land of the Dreams, Nameless of the Astral Express...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: ...To Penacony's past, present, future... and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: With that, our duty as Nameless should be complete... right?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: The Trailblaze can illuminate the way, but ultimately, the future of a world belongs to those who live in it.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...I still feel that Mr. Mikhail must have really wanted to witness this day himself.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: What's on your mind, March?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Just a strange feeling. I had it a few stops ago, but it's super strong this time.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Why not talk about it? Maybe everyone's thinking the same thing?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...I can't help but think that whether it's Mr. Mikhail, Mr. Tiernan, or Madam Razalina, their lives must have been long, and they must have experienced plenty of stories...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: They were also young once, stumbling and bumbling around just like us, getting into scraps and mischief, that sort of stuff. Companions, enemies, journeys, adventures, all the sad and happy memories... The "every day" that we're used to, they've lived through them too.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: But those things... are all in the past.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Time will wash everything away... so treasure the present.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: I know, but the thing that I can't get out of my mind... is the present.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: One day, our stories will also be a part of past.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Yeah, maybe that's the precise thing I can't let go of...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: You're awfully sentimental today...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: It's rare that I'm this serious, can't you just humor me for once? Sheesh!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: It'll be easier to understand if I use an analogy: Like when you're reading a book, if one of its characters keeps running into obstacles, and experiences an ending full of regrets, we're bound to feel a bit mixed about it, right?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: I could understand, but I'd feel mixed too.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: No matter what, that's very hard to accept.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: You won't be affected as long as you don't live vicariously through them.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: To me, it's because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: So even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: But what if they... and we... aren't really that special?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: When Mr. Mikhail sat in this chair, waiting for the Astral Express to arrive every day, what was he thinking? And if, at the end of his life, he could still firmly say he had no regrets...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Then, what is this regret we feel in our hearts right now...?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: I think, each and every one of us is searching for the answer to this very question.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: The universe is vast, and our lives are but specks. The Trailblaze never ends, but against the backdrop of the cosmos, the average person's lifelong journey is merely a short stretch.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: But it is in this miniscule distance that paths cross, and countless worlds connect. The universe may not remember every person who leaves a tie along the silver rail, but we will.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: As long as we remember, their stories will never end.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: And what Mr. Mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. It may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old Nameless' face at the end of his life.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: And its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after — us.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: It's not the answer that's important, but what we can learn from others' answers... right?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: This is what Trailblazing is.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...Sure.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: I'm really sorry for bringing down the vibe! Quick, Dan Heng, tell us a dad joke to lighten the mood!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: It's never a bad thing to reflect. One day, we'll all have to face our own farewells.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: But before that, we still have a long way ahead of us together.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: So the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in Penacony.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: Then prepare ourselves for our next Trailblazing destination.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Step DescriptionNow that the dust has finally settled, a new trailblazing expedition is about to begin.Go back to the Astral Express, collect your thoughts, and prepare yourself — for a new adventure. Parlor Car
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: :
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Do you still remember when we first arrived in Penacony? Who would have thought our paths would cross in such a way.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Who exactly are you?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Come to think of it, I didn't even get a chance to formally introduce myself...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Simply put, I'm a Self-Annihilator who was cursed by the Nihility. My hometown was destroyed a long time ago, and the whole world was erased beneath THEIR shadow.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In order to fight against the cruel end of self-destruction, I went on a journey, in search of a way to sever the chains of the Nihility. After a long and grueling search, I am convinced that my destination lies within the depths of the Dark Web, where reality and the Nihility are separate.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In there lurks a secret called "Device IX"... One day, I'll reach it.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Will we meet again?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: The ocean of stars is vast, and given our destinations, I'm afraid our paths may not cross again.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: But the trailblazing expedition ahead is always full of unknowns, and my blade is sharp enough to sever fate... As long as we maintain our original resolve, I believe there will come a day when we will meet again.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Have we ever met before?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Ah... In that case, I must apologize for my rudeness. Do you remember when we first met? I once said you reminded me of an acquaintance.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Because of the Self-Annihilator's curse, my memories are stripped away, blurring my past. And after our journey together, what I originally thought were familiar feelings were merely illusions... I believe this was truly our first meeting.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: What if... that wasn't an illusion?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: What do you mean? It's improbable that you've crossed paths with my past self... What I mean is, there is nothing left to retrace there — only Nihility.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: I think I might've seen... someone like you.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: I see... You've also had a similar experience? Then you should know that this me and your memory of me are not the same person.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: But some things will never change.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: ...Haha.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: ...Long ago, I, too, was like you, with irreplaceable companions. We also embarked on journeys, making the best choices we could whenever we could.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Unfortunately, we didn't achieve the outcome we wanted. But moments like this... make me feel like they never even left.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In this universe, there exist countless worlds that are similar yet different, and countless people who are alike yet distinct.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: I, too, have wandered alone, encountering "acquaintances" on strange worlds, seeing their silhouettes overlap with my past.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In your opinion, what does this "déjà vu" mean?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Perhaps some sort of emotional attachment.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: The wish to return to the past.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: A longing for a certain someone.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Attachment, desire, longing... They may all be right, but they are all incomplete.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: I believe it's not something external, but something that originates within us, an emotion that traverses time from a certain moment of our past to reach us.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Perhaps it's a source of warmth and happiness, or maybe it brings pain and sorrow. Each time we reminisce on our past, we always seem to notice a tiny, but unforgettable instant that we left behind us, along with certain other things that remain constant throughout...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: That is a summary of our lives, encapsulating everything about us in these moments... proof of our shared path.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Within them, we glimpse our own essence, and thus... we truly "exist."
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Just like everyone in this story, hurtling onwards along the path of destiny with passion and courage, for the things that breathe meaning into their lives.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Stranger in a Strange Land 1.mp4
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Set forth on your voyage without hesitation, Nameless, on the path of the Trailblaze.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Even if the ending has been predetermined, that's fine. There are countless things that humans cannot change.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: But before that, on the road towards the end, there are still many things that we can do.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: And because of this, the "end" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: This is the meaning of "journey."
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: All those things, beautiful before, are still so now. And I believe...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Media]: Trailblaze Mission Stranger in a Strange Land 2.mp4
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: It will still bloom at the end of the Nihility, until we meet again beneath the sun's rays.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: I understand. It's a feeling of longing.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Yes, I understand. Cherish this moment, for it can help you remember the path you've traveled.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Regardless of the significance, we live in the present.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: That is true. Our memories make us who we are, and all memories originate from the "now." As for the future... it's already taking root in the now, isn't it?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: With this as our first meeting, we can consider our next meeting to be a reunion.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: That's right. What matters more is not who I am but what we have done together. This story... will be forever etched in my heart.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: I should be on my way.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: We both still have our own paths to walk. So let's forge ahead. Hopefully, if we meet again... it'll be beneath clear skies.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: *sob*... *sniff*...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: There there... Chin up, Pom-Pom! Don't be sad. Don't cry...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: Wow, your method of consolation is truly unsophisticated.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...Still better than just standing there like a scarecrow!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: What happened?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Hey, you're finally back!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Is March picking on Pom-Pom again?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: How could you say that! Don't be so mean. And while you're here, why don't you help me comfort Pom-Pom!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: We told Pom-Pom all about our adventure, and... they suddenly started crying... I've never seen Pom-Pom so sad before...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: *sob*... The con... conductor never cries! Pom-Pom... is never sad!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Pom-Pom is just... just...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Just angry. Yeah, angry!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: No matter where the Express stops, you lot always manage to cause chaos! My well-thought-out timetable? Completely ignored! If you carry on like this, the Express is going to run out of fuel!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: That's right. Pom-Pom is just angry... It's not because of Misha, Tiernan, Razalina and the rest...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom: ...Bwaahhh!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: It's okay. Pom-Pom, just let it all out.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: Everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? Don't worry, I'll stay here with Pom-Pom.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: But...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: Let's go, March.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Himeko]: It's okay. Pom-Pom, just let it all out.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: I never expected Pom-Pom would be so distraught...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: Those three Nameless must have meant a lot to Pom-Pom.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: No one knows exactly when Pom-Pom boarded the Express, but one can surmise that their journey has been filled with many hellos and goodbyes, probably more than we can imagine.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: The fact that they're crying so hard is probably a good sign. It proves that Pom-Pom's emotions haven't become dulled by the grind of time — they still deeply cherish every Nameless who has boarded the Express and value every journey shared with them.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Leave it to Himeko. When it comes to comforting, there's no one better on the Express.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Pom-Pom said we might run out of fuel...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Well, they were a little emotional at the time, but... I'm afraid that's not out of the question.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Since  joined us, the Express has stayed longer than anticipated at every stop along the way. And to ensure that everyone always makes it back on board, Pom-Pom has had no choice but to delay the warp jump schedule.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: I see... No wonder I can regularly hear Pom-Pom pacing anxiously up and down the corridor.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Turns out, Pom-Pom's been silently putting in a lot of work for us, wow...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Different from typical vehicles, the Astral Express converts every "Trailblaze" into the energy it needs to run. Ideally, as long as trailblazing expeditions continue without interruption, the Express will receive a constant flow of energy, much like a perpetual motion machine.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: But because of our previous encounters... fuel is being used up much faster than expected. We can probably only pull off two more warp jumps at most.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Only two more... Isn't that super risky? Ahh! I don't wanna become an ice cube floating around in space again!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: At least you'll be an adorable ice cube.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: When you put it like that, it doesn't actually sound too bad.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: But I don't even wanna become an adorable ice cube floating around in space again!
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Falling leaves must return to their roots.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: ...How about we shove you back in the space station's computer, then?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: Which also means that we must prudently consider our next destination.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Yes. I've already checked the astral charts — the two nearest worlds to us are the oceanic planet of Lushaka and the Agate World, Melustanin.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: As for which one we're headed to, that still requires a vote...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][???]: ...Or, perhaps you might consider a suggestion.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: Everyone, we meet again.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: I-It's you? Why were you just in my room...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: It's a very cute room, Miss March... just like you.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Black Swan, what are you doing here?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: I knew we were missing someone...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Memokeeper... Let's put aside how you managed to sneak past everyone and board the Express for now — you mentioned a suggestion...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: I accidentally overheard how the Express obtains fuel.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: I just wanted to chat with everyone to see if we could work together, but now, it appears my suggestion could be the very lifeline that saves everyone.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Dan Heng]: Please speak candidly. Depending on what you say, we could very well ask you to disembark.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: Ah, the Permanence's descendant... What a charming little dragon, especially with those mired memories of yours.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: But I digress. If the Astral Express is in urgent need of a special trailblazing expedition to recharge its engine...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: Have you all considered this? Perhaps your destination could be a world that even the renowned Akivili never reached...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: Should you be able to lay down a new stretch of silver rail, the Express may never have to worry about energy ever again.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][March 7th]: Trailblazing to a world that even Akivili has never been to... Is that possible?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Welt]: Continue, Memokeeper. This destination of which you speak, what sort of world is it?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: A world that many across the universe don't even know exists...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: A world hidden away from outside observation, its presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the Garden of Recollection...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: A world fettered by three Paths, its destiny hanging in the balance...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Black Swan]: The Eternal Land, Amphoreus.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: ...

[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: ...I wasn't expecting it to be you.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Don't you know how many sentry posts The Family has built, and how hard it is to get you out of here?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: Looks like my time's up?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: What do you mean... What "time?"
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: Negotiation, interrogation, or death... My fate lies entirely in your hands, Lady Bonajade.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: The dance is done. Why bother with the compassionate pretense and give someone who's about to die the chance to talk?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Despite your fall from grace, you still look well. I'm very glad to see that you're so full of verve.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: Do not insult my pride with half-veiled sarcasm. Have you specially come to see me just to sate your vile vanity?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Of course not. I merely came to fulfill your younger sister's wishes. To offer you a generous trade — that is, if you're willing to accept.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: Robin...?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: To build a true haven where everyone can attain peace — that's the oath between you siblings, isn't it?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: If I told you there was still a chance to realize this vow... would you be willing to talk to me then?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: ...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: I recognize the gravity of this question, which is why you don't have to answer me right now.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Go now. You are free — O chosen one, who dared to exceed his bounds. Sever your wings, descend to the mortal realm, and walk their lands. See what this world is truly like.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Sunday]: I will not accept your charity.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: As I mentioned earlier: It's a trade, and you don't have to give me an answer right now. Rewards are not reaped in a day, and if there's one thing I'm best at, it's waiting. The sweet dream still continues, and the night is still long — you have plenty of time to contemplate your answer.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Ah, a word of advice for you before we part ways — a word of warning from someone who's been in your shoes before...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Life is too short to miss out on golden opportunities.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: :
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Do you still remember when we first arrived in Penacony? Who would have thought our paths would cross in such a way.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Who exactly are you?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Come to think of it, I didn't even get a chance to formally introduce myself...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Simply put, I'm a Self-Annihilator who was cursed by the Nihility. My hometown was destroyed a long time ago, and the whole world was erased beneath THEIR shadow.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In order to fight against the cruel end of self-destruction, I went on a journey, in search of a way to sever the chains of the Nihility. After a long and grueling search, I am convinced that my destination lies within the depths of the Dark Web, where reality and the Nihility are separate.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In there lurks a secret called "Device IX"... One day, I'll reach it.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Will we meet again?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: The ocean of stars is vast, and given our destinations, I'm afraid our paths may not cross again.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: But the trailblazing expedition ahead is always full of unknowns, and my blade is sharp enough to sever fate... As long as we maintain our original resolve, I believe there will come a day when we will meet again.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Have we ever met before?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Ah... In that case, I must apologize for my rudeness. Do you remember when we first met? I once said you reminded me of an acquaintance.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Because of the Self-Annihilator's curse, my memories are stripped away, blurring my past. And after our journey together, what I originally thought were familiar feelings were merely illusions... I believe this was truly our first meeting.

[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: I, too, have wandered alone, encountering "acquaintances" on strange worlds, seeing their silhouettes overlap with my past.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: In your opinion, what does this "déjà vu" mean?
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: Perhaps some sort of emotional attachment.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: The wish to return to the past.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Narration]: A longing for a certain someone.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Acheron]: Attachment, desire, longing... They may all be right, but they are all incomplete.

Rewards are not reaped in a day, and if there's one thing I'm best at, it's waiting. The sweet dream still continues, and the night is still long — you have plenty of time to contemplate your answer.
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Ah, a word of advice for you before we part ways — a word of warning from someone who's been in your shoes before...
[Stranger in a Strange Land][Jade]: Life is too short to miss out on golden opportunities.

[Homecoming Wardance][System]: You have an interstellar message. Please check it promptly.
[Homecoming Wardance][System]: You have an interstellar message. Please check it promptly.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Hmm? Whew...
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: What's up, Pom-Pom?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Just got a message from the Xianzhou Luofu. Looks like it'll conflict with our original schedule.
[Homecoming Wardance][Jing Yuan]: It's been a while, my friends on the Astral Express. How's your trailblazing expedition going?
[Homecoming Wardance][Jing Yuan]: Soon, the Xianzhou Luofu will be holding the Luminary Wardance. Those who have aided the Luofu in overcoming the crisis are cherished allies of the Xianzhou, thus, on behalf of the Seat of Divine Foresight, I'm extending an invitation to attend the ceremony. Your presence would be greatly appreciated.
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: Well, things are getting lively. We've barely recovered from The Family's Charmony Festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Trailblazing is all about having fun.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Why not think about it this way. Our trailblazing expeditions are turning into "blast expeditions," where we eat, drink, and play wherever we go.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Blast... expedition?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Yeah, wherever we go, we eat, play, and have a blast!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: I'm still recovering from the trauma caused by the last "festivity."
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Yeah, me too!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: But wait, won't it look unprofessional if we attend two ceremonies in a row? Aren't we supposed to be focused on restoring astral charts and doing some serious scientific exploration?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: So, we should leave March behind to take care of the Express?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: H-hey! That's not what I meant! I'm all for some fun... I just hope there won't be any surprise party crashers like Friday or Saturday.
[Homecoming Wardance][Welt]: The Xianzhou Luofu has recently overcome a crisis. By holding the Wardance, they're demonstrating to everyone that they've returned to a state of peace and safety.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: But that's what everyone said before we went to Penacony! "You'll be totally safe under The Family's protection!"
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: No need to worry. The Wardance is not like the Charmony Festival with all its hidden secrets. It's just a festival to honor the Reignbow Arbiter and the Cloud Knights who fought against the Abominations of Abundance and protected the Xianzhou ships.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Aside from starskiff performances, it's mostly martial contests, nothing too different from the Taikiyan Roboball contest we've seen before.
[Homecoming Wardance][Welt]: What do you think, Himeko? Since we've accepted Miss Black Swan's proposal, we should probably head to Amphoreus for refueling.
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: Mm, there's certainly no rush. This trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the Express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: With Madam Herta's help, I was planning to deliver some Leviathan fossils from Calenga Abyss to Ruan Mei, member #81 of the Genius Society. It could earn us some favors before we set off. However, it may take a few weeks.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Ah, so that means... we're not going to the Luofu.
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: Being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, March. Since we've been invited, it's only right for the Astral Express to attend the ceremony.
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: So, here's the plan: Pom-Pom will take everyone to the Xianzhou Luofu. Mr. Yang and I will meet up with Ruan Mei and fulfill our promise. Meanwhile, , March, and Dan Heng will represent the Express and attend the Wardance.
[Homecoming Wardance][Welt]: What do you two think,  and Dan Heng?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Sounds great. Let's split into groups!
[Homecoming Wardance][Welt]: I don't hear any objections.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: I want to play with Leviathan fossils, too!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Himeko and Mr. Yang will be busy with serious research. Besides, fossils can't compete with martial contests when it comes to fun, right?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Plus, you're the only one with so many friends on the Luofu. I'll be lost if you don't come along! You've got to lead the way.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Pom-Pom: Now that everyone's on board with the plan, it's time to warp to the Xianzhou Luofu.
[Homecoming Wardance][Welt]: Calenga Abyss... what does she expect to find there? Current research on Leviathan merely proves how little we know about such life forms...
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: That's why geniuses are interested in that field. Science is all about uncovering the unknown...
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: The conversation between the two adults brims with complex jargon, from "Assumptive Astrobiological Chemistry" to "Trans-dimensional Evolutionary Theory," filling the carriage with an air of dense perplexity.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Have a safe trip, you two.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Come back soon.
[Homecoming Wardance][Himeko]: Don't miss us too much, . If I stumble upon some cool Leviathan fossils, I'll bring a few back as souvenirs for you.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Himeko really knows how to convince people. Hehe, between Leviathan fossils and the Wardance, the latter definitely sounds more fun.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: By the way, Dan Heng... this time, you'll be taking a stroll with us on the Luofu, right?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Just let you and  wander around aimlessly on the Luofu by yourselves? I don't think so.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Plus, Mr. Yang is right. The Ambrosial Arbor Crisis just ended, and both the long-life and short-life species are still feeling uneasy. And that's why Jing Yuan wants to organize the Wardance, to show that the Xianzhou Luofu is stable and safe.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Since he has extended an invitation, it's only right that I visit my old friend.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know...
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: So, here's something for all of you, a poem by March 7th...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hey, I'm not actually gonna recite a poem! I was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived on the Xianzhou...
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: What memories? Care to spill the details?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Well, it's nothing too poetic. I was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived at the Xianzhou ship...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: This time, we're not being forced or enticed, or chasing after wanted criminals. And we didn't have to sneak in through the cargo dock. This trip has been incredibly smooth...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Quite unusual, I must say!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Definitely unusual!
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: I agree.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: We're so easily pleased. I actually feel sorry for us...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Such is the fate of us Nameless, I suppose.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Oh, come on, don't jinx us...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Haha, I'm just hoping for the best! You're the one jinxing us!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Is the Starskiff Haven always this crowded? There are so many people here! I can barely hear anything!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: : Yanqing said General Jing Yuan sent him to welcome us, but where is he?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Let's wait for him in front of the loom. It's the most prominent landmark on the dock.
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: Hey, you guys! Hold on a moment!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Did they just call us? Look at their outfits... they're from Penacony, right?
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: Are you familiar with the Xianzhou Luofu?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: We know a little bit about it. What do you need?
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: We're from Penacony, maybe you've heard of it? We came to this ship to gather interesting materials for making dream bubbles.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: We just left there. Talk about coincidence.
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: That's great! Do you know any must-see attractions on the Luofu?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: You've come to the right people!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Exactly! We're Xianzhou experts!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Why don't you ask the locals?
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: We did! But the locals were all like, "Come on, there's nothing worth seeing on the Luofu! It's so boring here!"
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: Can't blame them. If someone asked me, "What's there to see on Penacony?" I'd probably struggle to answer too.
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: That's why we're asking fellow tourists!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Most of the tourists around at the moment are here to attend the Wardance, and that's why we're here too.
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: Yeah, we know about that ceremony, but isn't the fighting ring still closed?
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: I've heard the ring was actually converted from a huge decommissioned Luofu fighter jet.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: So, it's even larger than a regular starskiff?
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: No doubt about it! It's a massive fighter jet! It's got to be larger than a civilian starskiff!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: So, it's even bigger than the Radiant Feldspar?
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: The Radiant Feldspar is bigger, I guess!
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: But for now, all we can do is wait until the Wardance starts in a few weeks before we can board it. We've still got work to do, so we can't just sit around waiting for it to start, that's why we're asking you about some must-see attractions.
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: We're looking for unique experiences that you won't find on Penacony. Our clients love these kinds of dream bubbles the most.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: You're the expert here, . Give them some suggestions!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Why not visit Aurum Alley?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Hmm, good idea. The everyday vibe of the Aurum Alley is a rare find on the Planet of Festivities.
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: Everyday vibe... Yeah, our clients have had their fair share of adrenaline-pumping Dreamscapes. Maybe something down-to-earth would touch their hearts.
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: Thanks for the suggestion. We'll head to the Aurum Alley to gather materials. Maybe we'll run into each other there in a couple of days.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Why not visit Fyxestroll Garden?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Oh, yeah! Fyxestroll Garden! It's famous for supernatural stuff, with those mischievous heliobi floating around! It's pretty fascinating!
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: Supernatural? I don't really like scary things... but our clients will love it.
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: It does sound interesting. Let's go check out Fyxestroll Garden! Maybe we'll bump into each other there!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Why not visit Scalegorge Waterscape?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: That's indeed a good idea. While the Dreamscape on Penacony is all artificial, Scalegorge Waterscape is a celebration of nature's resurgence. It has some remarkable scenery.
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: Awesome. I love being out there in nature. Let's go to Scalegorge Waterscape first.
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: I'm a bit worried that nature-themed dream bubbles might be outdated... but hey, let's go check it out anyway.
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: See you later. Maybe we'll run into each other there in a few days.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Why not climb to the top of the Ambrosial Arbor?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hey! That's a terrible idea! You'll get them arrested!
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: Haha... you're just joking, right? How about giving us some more practical suggestions?
[Homecoming Wardance][Pepeshi Tourist]: ...Wait a sec. Maybe it's not such a terrible idea after all? No risk, no reward! Come on, let's go climb that tree!
[Homecoming Wardance][Intellitron Tourist]: Slow down a bit. Wait for me.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hey, wait! Just think about what you're doing! And... don't mention our names if something goes wrong! Ugh, I hope they don't get into trouble... This is nerve-wracking.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Look, Yanqing's here.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Really! Let's go catch up with him!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: There you are! Everyone, this way!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Hey, everyone! It's been a while!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Doesn't feel like it's been that long since we last saw you, but Yanqing, are you...?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: What's up, Miss March?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: They say kids grow up really fast. Yanqing, are you a little bit taller than before?
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: We've only been away for a few months.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Long time no see, Yanqing!
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Long time no see!
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: It's been a while.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Oh, you've come along, too, Mr. Dan Heng.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Sorry for the delay. With the upcoming Wardance, and the Starskiff Haven being so busy, things are a little hectic.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Yeah, you're definitely taller!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Really? The General is always worried I won't grow much taller, but I keep telling him not to worry about it.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Sorry for the delay. With the upcoming Wardance, and the Starskiff Haven being so busy, things are a little hectic.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Huh? What are you doing, ?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: : Sorry, but after our previous adventures, I've become suspicious of whoever greets us first.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Do you have to be suspicious around me, too?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: : You know, the last time we came to the Xianzhou, the first person who greeted us was...
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: I get it. Better safe than sorry.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Seriously, I've never seen the Luofu so lively before.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: I was a bit worried that holding the Wardance right after the Ambrosial Arbor crisis might be too soon, but seeing the bustling Starskiff Haven, I understand why General Jing Yuan chose this timing.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Yep, there's people from other delves and travelers like you three who've come from afar.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: With the Wardance coming up, there's a huge number of visitors pouring into the Starskiff Haven. The Cloud Knights are working hard to keep the security tight.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: The General said this ceremony would help the Xianzhou Luofu recover from the crisis.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: It's a way to showcase our martial spirit, reassure people, boost morale, and attract visitors from other planets to promote trade and peace.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: By the way, the Xianzhou Alliance places great importance on this ceremony, too. The Xianzhou ships the Zhuming and the Yaoqing have both sent messengers to offer their blessings!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: The Xianzhou Zhuming?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Yeah, I wonder if you've heard of it, . It's known as the "Starforge" and is responsible for providing more than half of the Cloud Knights' armaments.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: The Xianzhou Zhuming boasts skilled craftsmasters, and General Huaiyan is a top-notch craftsman himself. Ah... if only I could get a sword forged by him! I'd be on cloud nine.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: The Xianzhou Yaoqing?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Yeah, the Xianzhou Yaoqing is a major force in hunting down abominations and is always engaged in conflicts across the cosmos. Although it's a member of the Xianzhou Alliance, I don't know much about it.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: But Madam Yukong from the Sky-Faring Commission mentioned that the Yaoqing always sends back reports of great victories, which is quite impressive.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: I heard General Feixiao of the Yaoqing is a young and dauntless lady. My peers say that she's like a goddess of war, capable of crushing dozens of abominations with a single punch... I wonder if it's true.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: ...If only I could witness her prowess with my own eyes.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: By the way, Yanqing, where are we headed next?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Ah, I'm sorry for talking your ear off. The General wants to catch up with you at the Palace of Astrum. He's been eager to hear about how the Express has been doing.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hehe, it's funny how he tries to act all mature, but whenever it comes to something he's interested in, you can really see his childish side.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Well, you're pretty much the same in that regard.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: I agree.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Yeah, he's adorable.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: I agree.
[Homecoming Wardance][???]: 
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knights Soldier]: All units, assemble quickly! Get ready to protect the crowd!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: I just mentioned security, and now all of a sudden something's gone wrong. Excuse me, I need to go check out the situation.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: It's like whatever you fear will happen, happens.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: You're just as jinxed as March.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hey, what's that supposed to mean?!
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: We'll go with you.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Protect the civilians. I'll deal with him.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Borisin?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Why are there borisin here?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: This ends now!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Not good!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Uh... Thanks for the help.
[Homecoming Wardance][???]: Sorry, no time to chat...
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Could you give me back my...
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Wait, my sword!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Let's just get down to business first.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we'll have to put our plans on hold for now. I need to find out what's going on.
[Homecoming Wardance][IPC Worker]: While we appreciate your rescue, my Xianzhou friends, don't you think it's a bit too much to detain us and our cargo?
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Sorry, but we've been ordered to detain you and your cargo for inspection until we figure out the source of the attack.
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Once we're done with the formalities, we'll let you and your cargo go.
[Homecoming Wardance][IPC Worker]: But this shipment isn't even meant for the Luofu! And it's IPC's patented technology. Who do you think you are to conduct an "inspection?"
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knight Soldier]: According to the protocol, all cargo arriving on the Luofu must go through inspection.
[Homecoming Wardance][IPC Worker]: But we didn't officially enter your dock at all! We just sought refuge in your dock because we were attacked by the borisin!
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Looks like this argument could go on forever. Let's not get involved in a heated dispute that won't lead to a resolution.
[Homecoming Wardance][IPC Worker]: How dare you detain our ship? Who do you think you are?
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knight Soldier]: We're just following the rules.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Who's in charge here? I need some answers.
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knight Captain]: It's my fault... we let our guard down for a moment. I take full responsibility.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: With the Wardance approaching, safety should be a top priority. Now, tell me, how did borisin prisoners end up in Starskiff Haven?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: According to the protocol, borisin prisoners should be held on a starskiff and taken directly to The Shackling Prison under strict supervision without ever touching the ground. Who allowed a prisoner transport ship to dock at the passenger terminal?
[Homecoming Wardance][???]: Please don't blame this captain. This incident involves the Zhuming's diplomatic vessel.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Who are you?
[Homecoming Wardance][???]: I'm Lujun, an officer of the patrol defense squad. Thank you for your help, Lieutenant Yanqing. The situation unfolded rapidly, and it shouldn't be held against the captain.
[Homecoming Wardance][Lujun]: Here's what happened. An IPC transport ship was attacked by the borisin just before arriving, and the Zhuming's diplomatic vessel came to the rescue. They fought off the borisin pirates and imprisoned them on their ship.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: So, an IPC ship was attacked by the borisin near the Luofu, and the Zhuming envoys saved them? This sounds complicated...
[Homecoming Wardance][Lujun]: Honestly, it gives me a headache too. The Zhuming diplomatic ship, adhering to standard procedure, docked at the passenger terminal to hand these criminals over to the Luofu.
[Homecoming Wardance][Lujun]: You know, with all the outsiders flooding onto the Luofu, the starskiff lanes are under immense pressure. The borisin desperadoes decided to put up a fight before the prisoner transport starskiff could get there, and that's what you just witnessed.
[Homecoming Wardance][Cloud Knight Captain]: We'll make sure these prisoners are sent to The Shackling Prison as soon as possible.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: I see, it's an unusual situation indeed. I'll report it to the Security Department of the Realm-Keeping Commission and ask for their cooperation in handling the aftermath.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: 
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: The Cloud Knights calm the crowd, then dispersed, and the street was restored to its peaceful state.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: You look much maturer now, Yanqing.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Please don't tease me, Miss March. The situation on the Xianzhou before the Wardance is like a calm lake that can be disturbed by even the smallest pebble — capable of generating far-reaching ripples with even the slightest disturbance.
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: What are those people... I mean, those "monsters" we just dealt with?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: I know! They're Kobolds, right?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Those werewolf monsters are known as "borisin." They are Abominations of Abundance, and we've been fighting them for a very long time.
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: Did you call them "the borisin"?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Yeah, those werewolf monsters are known as "borisin." They are Abominations of Abundance, and we've been fighting them for a very long time.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: The borisin have been a powerful force for a long time, plundering and enslaving many worlds. The threat they pose is just as terrible as the Swarm Disaster, and the Alliance even had a fierce war with them three decades ago.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Their presence has faded over the years, but who would have thought...
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: According to that officer, they attacked an IPC ship near the Xianzhou Luofu. Such a brazen attack seems quite unusual to me.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Yeah, that's what I find strange, too. It seems like the IPC and the borisin have some serious grudges.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Well, enough with the chitchat. The general wants me to take you to the Palace of Astrum.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: I'd love to chichat [sic] a little longer, but there are some things that can't be left unchecked...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hmm? Is it a serious matter? Maybe you'll... need our help in hunting down the borisin?
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Thank you, but it's no big deal.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: By the way... that young lady who just appeared... she took my sword. I'm thinking of filing a lost property report at the Realm-Keeping Commission to see if I can get it back...
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Hahaha, I doubt she did it on purpose!
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: So when Cloud Knights get into trouble, they have to call the emergency services too?
[Homecoming Wardance][March 7th]: Perhaps she's around here somewhere? Shouldn't we take a look?
[Homecoming Wardance][Narration]: You go file the report, and I go fetch the popcorn. It's gonna be quite the show...
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Don't remind me. I just zoned out for a moment, that's all.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Alright, let's not keep the general waiting.
[Homecoming Wardance][Dan Heng]: Don't worry. There aren't many people out there with that kind of talent. It shouldn't be too hard to find her.
[Homecoming Wardance][Lujun]: There sure are a lot of troublemakers around...
[Homecoming Wardance][Lujun]: We'll see to it that these criminals are sent to The Shackling Prison as soon as possible. The cleanup operation is already underway, Lieutenant Yanqing, so there's no need to worry about anything.
[Homecoming Wardance][Yanqing]: Thanks. By the way, you're... an officer of the patrol defense squad, right? I don't remember meeting you before...
[Homecoming Wardance][Lujun]: Well, I'm just a junior officer. I recently returned to the Luofu from the front lines and was temporarily assigned here for security duty before the ceremony.

[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: It's been a long journey, Elder Huaiyan. Thank you for your presence.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Heh, don't mention it. Thank you for taking the time to welcome me.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: General, I've brought our guests from the Express. I'm sorry for my bad timing. I didn't know you were meeting a guest, General.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Don't worry. You're just in time. It's been a while, my friends from the Astral Express!
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: How's everything going, General?
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: All is well when you have friends coming from afar.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: I dreamed about you on Penacony.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Oh? Well It's [sic] an honor to be in your dreams, my friend.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Did you miss us?
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Sure, how couldn't I have? It's not often we find such moments to reunite and enjoy one another's presence.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Since when did  and General Jing Yuan become such good buddies, Dan Heng? They seem to be having a great time.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: A lot must have happened without our knowledge. At least I hope that's the case...
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Allow me to introduce you to General Huaiyan. He's the Arbiter-General of the Xianzhou Zhuming, known as the Flaming Heart.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Hehe, no need to be so formal. I'm just a tourist here, no different from other tourists who've come to attend the ceremony.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Elder Huaiyan is not only one of the Arbiter-Generals but also the Furnace Master of the Artisanship Commission. Besides his martial skills, he excels in forging various weapons. Such talents are unique, even among the Arbiter-Generals.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Be it Arbiter-General or Furnace Master, these are merely titles given to me long ago. I've retired several times already, but with the current change in circumstances, the Marshal has called me back to duty, and I had no choice but to answer the call.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Well, in the end, I'm to blame. Living such a long life naturally brings its share of disapproval.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Dan Heng & Yanqing: It's an honor to meet you, General Huaiyan.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: It's my honor to meet you, General Huaiyan...
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Glad to meet you, General.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: No need to be all formal. Today I'm just a guest on the Luofu, the same as all of you.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: So, these three are the ones you mentioned, Jing Yuan? The heroes who helped you with the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis?
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Indeed. There's Dan Heng, March 7th, and ... Without their help, I'm afraid the Luofu might not have easily overcome this crisis.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: So, the Imbibitor Lunae's reincarnation has returned to the Luofu and will attend the Wardance. I'd love to have a drink with you should the chance present itself.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: You're more than welcome, General Huaiyan.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: And this young friend is...?
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing, my apprentice. He remains by my side as my retainer due to his youth, which I hope will season him with experience. He will stand for the Luofu's Cloud Knights in the upcoming Wardance, ready to take on all kinds of challenges.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Great, great! It's a real treat to see so many talented young people around here today.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Oh, I almost forgot... This is my apprentice, Yunli...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: It's you!
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Oh, it's you. Hello.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Oh, you two already know each other? Guess we don't need any introductions then!
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: What a coincidence! I was afraid I'd have trouble finding this girl.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Oh? Now you've piqued my curiosity... Tell me, how did you two become acquainted?
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: She helped me capture the escaped borisin prisoners at the Starskiff Haven. Allow me to express my gratitude for you, but when you left... you took my Flying Sword with you.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Your Flying Sword?... Oh, so that's why I found a dagger in my bag. Turns out it's yours.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Yes, it is. Now that we've met again, I hope...
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Nope, that won't do.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Won't do?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: You want your sword back, right? Well, you can't just take it back. On the Zhuming, when you lose your sword on the battlefield, you have to reclaim it on the battlefield.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: As for this little sword, it was supposed to strike that escaped borisin prisoner, but unfortunately its owner's agitated state caused it [sic] fly off like a kite with a broken string, and it missed its target.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: By the way, if I hadn't caught it and helped it hit its mark, that borisin prisoner would have gotten away.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Hold on a sec, Yunli. You took my sword without even asking, and now you're refusing to give it back?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: ...Heh, so much for Luofu swordmasters.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: What did you just say?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: If you just stepped up and took your sword back from me fair and square, I would have totally respected you. But nope, you tried to play it down, expecting me to just hand it back to you like it's nothing, in front of everyone...
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: With all due respect, you don't honor your sword, so you don't deserve it.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Hasn't anyone told you that taking without asking is stealing? If you want to settle this with swords... Fine, let's have a one-on-one duel right now...
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Well, that's more like it. Just be careful, because I'm not as easy to handle as the borisin.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: You too. Be quiet and apologize to Yanqing!
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Hey, whose side are you on, Grandpa?
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: I... um... I don't take sides!
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: It's a small misunderstanding, and an apology would be too much. I've heard about the Zhuming's incredible swordplay and craftsmanship, most notably the legendary Flamewheel Octet. Seeing Miss Yunli, who is among those ranks today... Well I must say, she definitely has that fiery edge.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: ...Such grandiose names. Some folks love to spin these fancy titles, trying to set the Cloud Knights apart. Yunli is still just a young girl, a bit awkward and hot-tempered. So please forgive her if she's being rude.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Well, everyone, Elder Huaiyan and I have some business to discuss. For now, Yanqing, why don't you entertain our guests and take Miss Yunli to the inn?
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: I'll find another chance to talk with you all. I'd like to express my gratitude to the Astral Express for helping the Luofu during the crisis.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: That's so kind of you. I mean you've already thanked us so many times.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Please forgive me for coming at an inconvenient time.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: You needn't apologize, General Huaiyan.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Alright, Yunli. Take this opportunity to clear things up with Yanqing.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Yeah, yeah, it's better to make friends than enemies, but I won't be heading to the inn just yet... I want to visit Lingsha. She just arrived on the Luofu and could use some help settling in.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing, once you've helped our guests get settled, go to the Artisanship Commission for me. I've heard about the attack and the detainment of the IPC ship. Qingzu sent word that the IPC members are protesting and wish to have their cargo back.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: See if you can calm them down. Don't get aggressive. Just make it clear that the Xianzhou Luofu has no intention of violating their rights.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: I'm on it.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: I'm sorry for Yanqing's rudeness.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Not at all. Taunted by Yunli like that, even a training dummy would be angry. You've taught your apprentice well. If it were me in my younger days, I'm afraid I'd have drawn my sword and fought.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Yanqing can understand your concerns. On the other hand, Yunli is still a naive girl who's only interested in swordplay. Honestly, I brought her here to participate in the Wardance because I want to broaden her horizons.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: This trip is totally worth it. Compared to the Zhuming, the Luofu is so much livelier.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: But it's a shame the Luofu swordmasters don't seem that great...
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Glad to meet you, Miss Yunli.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Glad to meet you, too. Are you here to participate in the Wardance?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: I'm just a tourist attending the ceremony.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: So, you're not a participant? You look like you know your way around a fight.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Well, you can still sign up. The Cloud Knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Can outsiders participate in the Wardance as well?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Of course. To honor martial arts, the Cloud Knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: If you can defeat the ringmaster selected by the Xianzhou, you'll not only win rewards and prizes but also be making a name for yourself.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Sounds tempting, doesn't it?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: What's the "Flamewheel Octet" the general spoke of?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: That's how outsiders refer to my peers in the Zhuming Cloud Knights and the Artisanship Commission.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: We all train under Grandpa's guidance, learning the art of craftsmanship and swordplay. That's how we got that title, I guess.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Just don't mention it in front of Grandpa. He always says that empty titles bring pointless challenges and conflicts. We Zhuming swordmasters pride ourselves on the success of the group over the individual.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Aren't you coming with us?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: I have some things to do. Besides, little Yanqing doesn't seem too happy about me tagging along.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: He shouldn't have said you "stole" his sword.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: But you did take his sword...
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: You're right. I "took" it with my skills, so I guess you can say I'm a robber or something. How dare he imply I'm a thief. Totally different!
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: Besides, the sword seems scared of its own master. I'd like to ask him – you claim to cherish your sword as your life, yet you don't even recognize the state it's in right now?
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: I didn't intend to keep his sword. I was planning to take this chance to return it to him, but now I've changed my mind.
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: I'll give that poor flying sword some proper maintenance. I won't consider returning the sword unless he learns how to say "please," "hello," "thank you," and "sorry."
[Emissary Mystique][Yunli]: So he can forget about it for now!
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: You scratch your head, feeling a tingling sensation on your scalp at the thought of the impending troubles Yanqing will face. While you're distracted, the young girl has already wandered off on her own, her whereabouts unknown.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Hey, Dan Heng, I thought all the Xianzhou generals were like Jing Yuan...
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: But that General Huaiyan, he looks... so thin and scraggy, as if even a light breeze would knock him over. Is that old man really an Arbiter-General?
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: Each Xianzhou ship has its own division and specialty within the Alliance, not all of the Arbiter-Generals are good at leading the charge. You heard what Jing Yuan said, right? General Huaiyan was once the head of all the skilled craftsmen on the Zhuming.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: There appears to be more than meets the eye.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Don't you find it strange, ? Do Xianzhou people age? I rarely see any old people on the Xianzhou ship, and when I do, they're usually travelers.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: But... General Huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. Is he really a Xianzhou general?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Why does he look so old?
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Yeah, you've noticed that too. It's really weird... Do the Xianzhou people age? I rarely see any old people on the Xianzhou ship, and when I do, they're usually travelers.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: But... General Huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. Is he really a Xianzhou general?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Perhaps he's a robot.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Like Madam Herta? Hmmm, that would make sense. Anyway, it's really weird for a Xianzhou native to look so old.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: Good question. He's right there, so why don't you ask him yourself?
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Nah, I'd like to live a little longer.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: We should leave. General Jing Yuan asked Yanqing to entertain us, so obviously, he has important matters to discuss. Let's not waste any time here.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: This is the report Qingzu just sent me. Let me take a look...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: ...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: ...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Looks like the general has given me a tough challenge. He wants me to try and help put the IPC's mind at ease.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Is this some kind of test from the general?
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Well, it's not exactly a "test." As Cloud Knight officers, we not only learn the art of war and martial arts but also occasionally have to handle diplomatic disputes.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: It's just, you know... Talking things out isn't as straightforward as duking it out with weapons on the battlefield. This is especially true when you're up against the IPC, with their non-stop corporate babble.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Well, let's not worry about that for now. Shall I take you to the inn?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Let's go.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Not yet.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: After watching Yanqing and the others leave...
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: It is the Luofu's honor to have you in attendance at the Wardance.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: Yet, the fact that a simple martial arts ceremony has attracted esteemed generals from the Zhuming and the Yaoqing implies intentions beyond mere spectating. Might there be any specific instructions from the Marshal?
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: You're overthinking it, Jing Yuan. As I said, I'm here to broaden my granddaughter's horizons. I have no ulterior motives.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: However, I have no clue what the Yaoqing Arbiter-General has in mind.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Do you remember when you accepted this position? I told you that an Arbiter-General's battlefield goes beyond the physical one. You'll need to lead and manage everything on the Xianzhou... The title of Arbiter-General holds a weight far greater than its literal meaning.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: So many years have passed, and you've done well. However, longevity for the Xianzhou people can be a curse. Living too long means that every mistake you made will lurk in the shadows, and one day, they'll eventually catch up to you.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: The Marshal knows everything that has happened on the Luofu. As for the Merlin's Claw of the Yaoqing...
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: ...She has come specifically for you.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Speaking of which, why hasn't she arrived yet? They say the Merlin's Claw strikes like lightning. Being late isn't her style.
[Emissary Mystique][???]: That's not true, General Huaiyan. She's been here a while, but I'm sure you've heard of her unbridled nature.
[Emissary Mystique][???]: As soon as she disembarked from the starskiff, she mentioned having something to attend to and simply disappeared.
[Emissary Mystique][Jing Yuan]: You must be the messengers from the Xianzhou Yaoqing, I assume.
[Emissary Mystique][???]: We are Jiaoqiu and Moze, retainers of the Merlin's Claw. It's an honor to meet you in person, Arbiter-Generals.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: Now, this is interesting. A guest who doesn't come to visit but sends a message instead. What does she mean? Tell me, what could be more important to her than coming here?
[Emissary Mystique][Jiaoqiu]: Master heard about a spectacular view in Scalegorge Waterscape. I believe she went there to enjoy it.
[Emissary Mystique][Huaiyan]: A "spectacular" view? Hah! Did you hear that, Jing Yuan? This person is being sarcastic.
[Emissary Mystique][Jiaoqiu]: Please do not misunderstand me, General Huaiyan. I was simply stating the truth. Master thought it would be inappropriate to keep you waiting, so she sent us here...
[Emissary Mystique][Jiaoqiu]: Once she's finished with admiring the scenery, she'll personally come and apologize to the both of you.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: In the meantime, outside the Palace of Astrum...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Drat, I forgot to ask Yunli to return my sword...
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: I'll go get it back for you.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: No need to bother. The Zhuming envoys won't be leaving the Luofu anytime soon. I'll ask for it later when we meet again.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: I don't think you'll ever get your sword back!
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Unacceptable! Every sword is precious to me!
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: If it weren't for the general's interference, I would have taught that shameless girl a lesson in swordplay...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: By the way, I don't know if it's just me, but the general seemed a little... hmmm, reserved? Could it be because of Elder Huaiyan's visit?
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Reserved? Really?
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Maybe I'm just overthinking things.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: No, you're not. When I entered the Palace of Astrum, I realized that the messenger from the Xianzhou Zhuming was actually the Arbiter-General himself. So, the messenger from the Xianzhou Yaoqing must be the Merlin's Claw herself, I presume?
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: That's right.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: That's what makes this entire thing so unusual.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: What's so unusual about it? They simply received an invitation from Jing Yuan, just like the Crew, right?
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: The Wardance is just a small festival, and now we have two Arbiter-Generals from other Xianzhou ships here. I'm afraid they're here for something more.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: Maybe they've come to hold Jing Yuan accountable for the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis?
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Hold him accountable? Come on, didn't the Luofu fall victim to the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and the Antimatter Legion? Why would they blame the victim?
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: Dan Shu's rebellion and Phantylia's scheming are merely one side of the story to the other Arbiter-Generals of the Alliance. Only a single piece of incontrovertible evidence remains, creating an endless source of potential complications.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: The Ambrosial Arbor.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: Yes, it's undeniable that the plaguemark, which was subdued by the Xianzhou Luofu, has resurfaced. But was it really a conspiracy instigated by the Antimatter Legion, or does it indicate a traitorous intent from within the Luofu, implicating Jing Yuan himself?
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: Once the spark of suspicion is kindled, it proves hard to extinguish.
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: We can vouch for Jing Yuan, though.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: The general must have had that in mind when he invited us to attend the Wardance
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: No wonder we were called back for the ceremony.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: What was I thinking, seriously. Here I was looking forward to a carefree and enjoyable trip, but it seems wherever we go, drama is just around the corner.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Aww... I was so excited. I thought those Arbiter-Generals were just here to see the ceremony...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: By the way, I heard that an alchemist from the Zhuming diplomatic ship has arrived, and rumors say that she's to be the new Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission on the Luofu.
[Emissary Mystique][Dan Heng]: An alchemist from the Zhuming serving as the Cauldron Master on the Luofu? While it's not unheard of, the timing itself...
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Thanks to your words, Mr. Dan Heng, now I finally see the underlying tensions.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: The general is under tremendous pressure right now, but I was completely oblivious to his troubles... How naive of me!
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Come on! Don't think like that! Leave the adult matters to the adults. Even if you wanted to do something for the general, it's not like you can do anything.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: ...
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Uh, did I say something wrong again?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: You're a real master of conversation!
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Please, March, just keep quiet.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Miss March is right. I don't have the skills to share the general's burdens at the moment.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: ...Still, I'll do my best to follow his instructions. Let's go. Once I've taken you to your accommodations, I need to go to the Artisanship Commission to handle the IPC's protest.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: He looks like he has a lot on his mind. We can't just let him go alone... Why don't we accompany you to the Artisanship Commission?
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: This... is too much trouble. While I appreciate your kindness, dealing with the IPC workers could be tricky... I'm afraid this will cause trouble for the Express...
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: No worries! We're pretty experienced in dealing with the IPC! You've heard of the Ten Stonehearts, right? We've dealt with quite a few of them, right, ?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Brag all you want, but don't drag me into this.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Hey, who's bragging? Anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary IPC workers. Surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than Aventurine, do you?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: You're a real master of conversation!
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: Yeah, exactly... Uhm, are you being sarcastic?
[Emissary Mystique][Narration]: Stop, stop! I don't want to end up in an IPC lawsuit.
[Emissary Mystique][March 7th]: What's with you turning into a scaredy-cat? I didn't see you worrying about lawsuits when you wrecked that giant mech.
[Emissary Mystique][Yanqing]: Well, since you're willing to help, I won't decline your kindness. Let's head to the Artisanship Commission and meet them.

[From Growls to Grace][???]: Can I really reason with you Xianzhou people?
[From Growls to Grace][???]: Heh, I think I get it now. In your words, this is called "looting a burning house," right?
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: But I AM trying to reason with you here!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: :
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: You know what? This isn't my first time dealing with the Sky-Faring Commission, I can handle your unreasonable ways.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: But straight-up snatching IPC cargo, isn't that going a bit too far?
[From Growls to Grace][Kongqing]: Just as I've said it many times already. Once we've inspected the cargo and completed the security check, you can be on your way. Is there something wrong with your ears, or is it just your brain?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: I'm hearing you loud and clear! I'm thinking clear! And my answer is crystal clear: Not a chance!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Keep detaining my cargo, and I'll file a complaint directly with your general!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: What's all this arguing about?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Don't think you can possibly convince me! Uh huh?! Why are you here?!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Skott, what are you doing here!?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: I was gonna ask you the same thing! Why do I keep running into you?!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Did I just hear a dog barking?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: You jerk! Who are you calling a "dog?" Wait... w-why are you here?!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: You're staying on the Xianzhou, are you? What terrible luck. Wherever you go, disasters aren't far behind...
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: Aren't you the guests from the Astral Express? What brings you and Yanqing to the Artisanship Commission?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: I heard you're in trouble.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: They're in trouble? No, it's me! I'm the one in trouble!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: I'm here to help Yanqing sort out the trouble caused by the IPC.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Trouble caused by the IPC? I'd say it's caused by the Sky-Faring Commission!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Looks like you've met this IPC worker before, ... I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: I was sent here to deal with the IPC protest, Miss Xikui. What's going on here?
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: As you know, this IPC transport ship was attacked by the borisin and rescued by the Zhuming's diplomatic ship. Then the Cloud Knights were instructed to bring it back to the dock for repairs and inspections.
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: And this is Mr. Skott, the person in charge of this transport ship.
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: So, you're Skott! I've heard  mention you! Weren't you kicked off the Luofu before? Why did you come back?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Like I wanted to come back! I thought I'd just dock at the harbor for repairs and leave this forsaken place for good. Little did I know, as soon as the ship entered the harbor, a bunch of Cloud Knights showed up and snatched all our cargo from the hold!
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: What do you mean by "snatched?" I've told you a million times. It's a security check.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Then why did you bring the cargo to the Artisanship Commission? You even brought in some shady craftsman. It's obvious that you're trying to steal the IPC's patented technology!
[From Growls to Grace][Kongqing]: Listen here... Firstly, the Sky-Faring Commission detected dangerous items that could possibly be weapons in your cargo hold, that's why they called me here to double-check. Secondly, where the heck did you get the idea that I'm a "shady craftsman!?"
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Even if there are dangerous items, what do they have to do with you? It's not even being shipped to the Luofu. We'll just fix the ship and be on our way, we won't unload our cargo here.
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: But you'll have to stay in the port for several days before your ship is repaired and you can take off again. How can we just leave unchecked items sitting here?
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: I understand... but we don't need to disassemble the cargo if it's just a security check, right?
[From Growls to Grace][Kongqing]: In most cases, we don't. However, our scans discovered that the cargo doesn't only contain machinery but also some... substance that resembles biological tissue.
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: Biological tissue? Does this crate contain living things?
[From Growls to Grace][Kongqing]: I'm afraid we'll need to wait for the Alchemy Commission for further confirmation. In any case, according to our regulations, we need to unseal one of the crates for further examination, but this IPC specialist has been hindering us on the grounds of patent secrecy.
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: The Alliance's regulations on biological products are very strict. Without further inspection, there is no way for the Sky-Faring Commission to release the cargo.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Oh, really? Fine! If anyone lays a finger on that shipment, they'll have me to deal with! It doesn't matter if it's mechanical or biological, it's none of your business! I'm filing a complaint against the Sky-Faring Commission's ridiculous regulations!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: This Mr. Skott seems stubborn and difficult to persuade. Honestly... I really don't want to have a vicious confrontation with the IPC...
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Well, I know a thing or two about convincing Skott...
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Leave it to me! I'm an expert negotiator!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: I heard how you helped Aurum Alley, . The IPC representative back then was Mr. Skott, right? Since you've dealt with him before... it looks like I'll have to rely on you again, .
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: What are you guys whispering about over there? Just hurry up and give us back our cargo!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: :
[From Growls to Grace][Opponent information]: 
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Skott
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: One of the representatives stationed on Xianzhou by the IPC.He picks on the weak but fears the powerful. His experience in the IPC has taught him that he has to abide by the rules, at least on the surface.
[From Growls to Grace][Negotiation strategies]: 
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Your logic is too confusing for anyone to follow. Maybe you should learn the art of communication from a monkey before you continue spouting nonsense.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Alright, we understand your position, but rules are rules, and we can't bend them now... However, we'll note down your concerns and pass them on to management. We'll keep you updated on any developments.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Huh...? Could you repeat that? I didn't quite hear you. Could you say it again?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Speaking of regulations, we have our own laws and regulations too. According to Article 4 of the Xianzhou Alliance-IPC Trade Consensus, the Alliance and IPC shall never infringe on each other's intellectual property rights.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Make proposals from the legal perspective.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : The Alliance can sign a non-disclosure agreement with you. That way, you won't have to worry about any infringements, right?
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: We can sign a mutually acceptable non-disclosure agreement in accordance with the IPC's rules.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well, t-that makes sense, but... how can we trust you to honor the terms?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Start by making him feel uncomfortable.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : I didn't expect to see you again, Mr. Skott! We had such fun in Aurum Alley last time. It seems our paths are destined to cross once more.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: ...Stop pretending we're friends! If I could actually beat you, I'd punch you in the face! So, are you guys going to resolve this problem? Or are you just going to let this clown put on a show here?
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: Let's just pretend we don't know , Dan Heng.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Use Yanqing's identity to intimidate him.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Back in Aurum Alley, you were dealing with civilian merchants, where you could use the IPC's name to scare them.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : But this time, the Cloud Knight lieutenant standing before you represents the will of Luofu's general and won't be intimidated by your words.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Of course, I'm sure we both want a peaceful resolution.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Yeah, that's true. Of course, I want things to be resolved peacefully, but aren't we getting stuck in rigid formalities here?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Remind him of his embarrassing past.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Hey, everyone! Meet my old friend, Skott. He's very talented, especially at imitating animals.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: S-stop it! Let's focus on the business at hand. What's the point in dragging up the past?
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: Whoa, you're amazing! Can you teach me? Which animals can you imitate?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: J-just forget it...
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Even if we set aside the secrecy of intellectual property, these prototypes built by the Intelligentsia Guild are incredibly valuable, beyond your wildest imagination! If anything goes wrong, you won't be able to pay for it even with your lives!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Just skip the reasoning part and resort to good old violence.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : I've got a brilliant idea! I'll just smash everything with my bat, and then you can hire someone to assess the damage. That way, your cargo won't need any inspection, right?
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Calm down, . The general wants us to handle this peacefully.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: So, this is the great idea you came up with? Fine! Why don't you just step over my lifeless body?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Assure him that you will proceed with caution.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Don't underestimate Xianzhou technology. Even if they need to dismantle your cargo, the Artisanship Commission can easily put it back together.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Yeah, go ahead and brag about their skills. After all, you're just a negotiator they hired.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: But I'm different. I'm an IPC member, and my fleet has accepted this transportation order. Naturally, I need to be responsible for the integrity of every piece of cargo.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Pay you compensation? You wish!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Hah! I've taken Herta's curios, and even destroyed Ruan Mei's experimental subjects, but have I ever paid a penny for them? And now you think you can just come and ask me for compensation?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Listen up, brat. Don't think that your fancy connection to the Genius Society scares me. The IPC and those geniuses are working together. We're not taking orders from them.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: The Sky-Faring Commission can pay compensation.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Can you give us an exact amount, Mr. Skott? If there's any damage after the inspection, the Express... um, I mean, the Sky-Faring Commission will compensate you.
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: The Sky-Faring Commission... Yeah, they will compensate you... provided a detailed report of the damage is submitted.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: I don't doubt the financial strength of the Sky-Faring Commission... However! This is not just about money!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Besides, the cargo on this transport vessel belongs to the Intelligentsia Guild. If you want to inspect the cargo, shouldn't you at least call in a member of the Intelligentsia Guild to be present?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Show him your extensive connections.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : I'm pretty tight with Dr. Ratio from the Intelligentsia Guild, almost like family. Doesn't that make me practically a member of the Intelligentsia Guild too?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: What's all this nonsense? Even if you were married to him, you still couldn't represent the Intelligentsia Guild!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: It's time to escalate the issue!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : You're pulling out all the stops, and you've even dragged members of the Intelligentsia Guild into this. Seems like you're not interested in resolving this at all.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Since we've met each other before, Mr. Skott, let me share some information. Your transport ship was attacked by the borisin, and the Cloud Knights might see it as more than just a random attack.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Hehe, you think you can scare me with that? What exactly do you mean?
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Sure, you might purely be innocent victims of a borisin attack, but think about it another way. Why would the borisin launch such an attack near the Luofu? Perhaps some of your crew members colluded with them?
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: We may need to interrogate every one of your crew to eliminate this potential risk?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: ...You know what? I don't think we really need a member from the Intelligentsia Guild present. I'm just hoping... that all the procedures will be thoroughly followed, you know?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Try to resolve this according to Xianzhou regulations.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : According to the principle of territoriality, since your vessel is stranded on the Xianzhou, the Sky-Faring Commission has the right to inspect it.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Indeed. According to Article 27 of the Xianzhou Legal Code: "All official and private goods, upon entering the port, shall be subject to inspection. Failure to submit to such inspection shall be deemed equivalent to the possession of unlawful items and shall be subject to legal ramifications."
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Huh? My Synesthesia Beacon must not be working... because I have no idea what you just said.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Simply put, if you insist on hindering the inspection, we'll have to treat the cargo as unlawful items and confiscate it.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Confiscate it?! How... how can you Xianzhou people be so unreasonable!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: If this were Pier Point, and incoming cargo posed a safety risk, the IPC would take it in for containment and disposal, correct?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Umm... t-that's true, but the IPC s-sometimes makes exceptions. For example, they've always given special terms to Xianzhou vessels.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Try to resolve this according to IPC regulations.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Since the Intelligentsia Guild entrusted the cargo to the IPC for transportation, it's the IPC's responsibility to ensure its safety, right? Why would you need a member of the Intelligentsia Guild to be present?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Hehe, let me tell you something! As stated in Article 17 of the IPC's Building Material Logistics Department Transport Agreement Law: "Subsequent to the dispatch of goods and during their transit, all risks, save for those pertaining to the transportation safety, shall be the sole liability of the consignor."
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well! We only protect the integrity of the goods and prevent anyone with ill intentions from getting their hands on them, for example...
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: As for whether the cargo itself poses a security threat to the destination, that's not our responsibility. It appears we have reached an area beyond your expertise, doesn't it? The complexities of legal studies are indeed challenging!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: We both need to follow the regulations, because that's how the IPC and the Xianzhou operate, right? As an IPC worker, I have to abide by its regulations. If I make an exception and allow you to inspect the cargo, it'll spell disaster for me.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: The Xianzhou people are just following their own rules.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Everyone has their own set of rules. Now that you're on their turf, shouldn't you follow their rules, too?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Yeah, I get it. I know I'm on the Xianzhou, but if I violate the IPC regulations, I'll be in deep trouble when I get back!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Try to bribe him.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : How about this, pal? We go way back... so, if you make things easy for us today, we'll make it worth your while. What do you say?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Are you seriously trying to bribe me right in front of everyone? If I show you any favoritism, the disciplinary officers will come down on me!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Don't worry! They'll get their cut too!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Let's just do this legally, .
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Talk about his unpromising career prospects.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : I understand that you're trying to stick to the IPC regulations, and that's commendable, Mr. Skott. But what you fail to see is that this argument is tarnishing the IPC's reputation on the Xianzhou.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : If this conflict with the Sky-Faring Commission escalates, it won't just make things difficult for your business, but it'll also have an impact on your career down the line.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Of course, I... I never wanted conflict with the Xianzhou. Like I said, all I wanted was to retrieve the cargo and be done with it, but they just refuse to let us go.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Swallow your pride and beg him.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : Please, help me! I mean it! I bragged to my friends that I could convince you... If you don't do me this favor, I'll be so embarrassed! Come on, don't be so cold-hearted!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : I'm truly sorry for what I did in Aurum Alley. Please, just forgive me and give me an opportunity to fix things!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Huh? Attempting to play the humility card to gain my sympathy? I'm an IPC specialist. Do you honestly think I have even a shred of sympathy left in me? Just get lost already!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: ... do we really have to stoop this low?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Alright, that's enough. I'm not going to repeat myself a hundred times.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: I thought you were reasonable and civilized, but now it seems you Xianzhou folks just don't understand the basics of business.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: We've signed a confidentiality and security agreement with the Intelligentsia Guild, and if we breach it, we'll have to pay a hefty sum! Even if we sold the souls of every employee in the Marketing Development Department on this planet, it still wouldn't be enough to cover the costs.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Listen up, kid. I don't mind delaying this transport for a few more days. Once the engines are repaired, our ship will leave immediately, and you won't have any reason to inspect the cargo.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: If that's the case, I can assure you the Cloud Knights won't let your ship leave.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Oh, really? Then you'll receive a ton of complaints from the Intelligentsia Guild and the IPC's Marketing Development Department. You're too young, I don't think you understand the chaos your rash decision will cause.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Since you put it that way, Mr. Skott, I'll take it as your agreement to the inspection procedure. Now...
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Not so fast, you little brat. According to the IPC regulations, I have the right to arm myself and protect the property on my transport ship.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: I thought you were reasonable and civilized, but now it seems the IPC just wants to play by its own rules. My apologies, Mr. Skott.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Stop him, guys! For the Amber Lord!
[From Growls to Grace][IPC Staff Members]: For the Amber Lord!!!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Get up, all of you! Why is the IPC even paying you? You're a bunch of losers!
[From Growls to Grace][???]: Just be grateful that the "little brat" showed you mercy. At least your staff aren't seriously injured.
[From Growls to Grace][???]: How do you IPC cronies have the audacity to fight Cloud Knights...? You practically assaulted law enforcement officers.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Another one? Who the heck are you?!
[From Growls to Grace][???]: I may be a bit late, but the good news is: I'm here now.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well, you guys sure know how to argue your case...
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Fine! I'll allow you to do the security inspection. It's just that... I need some time to sort things out. This is a big deal. Let me talk to headquarters first.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: So, Mr. Skott, are you just stalling for time, and planning to leave the Xianzhou as soon as your ship is repaired to avoid the Sky-Faring Commission's inspection?
[From Growls to Grace][???]: Well, IPC staff are free to come and go, as long as they don't break any laws.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Yeah, you've got some insight there. Who are you again?
[From Growls to Grace][???]: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Lingsha, Cauldron Master and Head of the Alchemy Commission on the Luofu.
[From Growls to Grace][Dan Heng]: Could she be...?
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Yeah, she's the new Cauldron Master assigned here from the Xianzhou Zhuming.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: I received a report from the Artisanship Commission about cargo containing samples of unknown organisms. It said they needed help from the Alchemy Commission. I had nothing better to do, so I came myself.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: It's fine, Mr. Skott. If you really don't want your cargo to be inspected, it doesn't matter.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: It doesn't matter? How can you say that?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Why are you being so nice all of a sudden? Well, since you're not going to check it, I'll take this crate and be on my way. Is that okay with everyone?
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Yeah, sure. Why should I object? Not only this sample, but all the goods on the transport ship are yours to keep. Like I said, we won't inspect them.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Wait a minute!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well, that's more like it! If only the young displayed a more... reasonable attitude, we could have sidestepped that altercation just now.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Our ship will leave in a few days once the engines are repaired.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Your ship can leave whenever you want, but I'm afraid I can't say the same for the cargo.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: According to the import and export regulations signed between the Xianzhou and IPC, all biological shipments can only leave the port when they have confirmed to be of no threat, or when all biological activity expires.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Since we can't determine if your shipment is safe for the environment, I guess we'll have to wait for its biological activity to expire. Let me check the previous cases...
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Normally it'll only take around forty-seven star calendar years.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: "Only" forty-seven years?
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Why so surprised? You're still young and full of energy. I'm pretty sure you'll live a few more decades. Have some confidence in yourself!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Typical of a long-life species, your words are dripping with sarcasm. While you may not care about time, I do! I'll be demanding double compensation from the Sky-Faring Commission for every minute wasted!
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Sure thing, Mr. Skott. You seem pretty confident that your career and life will last long enough to witness this victory unfold.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: ...
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Step aside, guys. Let them do the inspection.
[From Growls to Grace][IPC Worker]: But Mr. Skott...
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Come on, we're already in enough trouble... Just let them do the security inspection. And if needed, I can always grovel before the Intelligenstia [sic] Guild later — I'm just using my head for what it's apparently good for, right?
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Sorry for the trouble.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well, honestly, at least you're not as annoying as that woman.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: : But you're still as annoying as ever.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Thanks, bro.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well, honestly, at least you're not as annoying as that woman.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: "Bro?" Just do the inspection!
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: At least you've wised up for once.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Well, honestly, at least you're not as annoying as that woman.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Just get on with the inspection! Don't act all chummy with me now that you've got your way.
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: This lady... is really something else!
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Is this the IPC product?
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: Listen up, any damages caused by inspections will be filed with the IPC...
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Turn it off!
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Well, how unexpected... that was a surprise~
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: Were you seriously planning to leave this stuff unchecked at the dock for days? That's way too dangerous!
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: I... I had no idea about it! You must have accidentally triggered the cargo's defense program!
[From Growls to Grace][Dan Heng]: I don't think trying to shift the blame is a wise choice.
[From Growls to Grace][Skott]: But seriously, I don't know why that thing suddenly started moving...! I swear on the Amber Lord!
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Enough. Miss Xikui, please escort our IPC guests to the Sky-Faring Commission.
[From Growls to Grace][Xikui]: I'm on it. Please follow me, Mr. Skott.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Our preliminary inspection shows that there is indeed hidden biological tissues inside, just like the craftsman feared.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: I can't even tell if it's ingenium or biological in nature.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Why do you say that?
[From Growls to Grace][Kongqing]: The core of this device is what they call "wetware" in industry slang. To put it simply, this machine operates with a kind of biological nerve as its control center.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: I'll take some samples for the alchemists to analyze and figure out where the biological tissue comes from.
[From Growls to Grace][Dan Heng]: Why would the Intelligentsia Guild use such unethical technology? Perhaps they are trying to create a new weapon?
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Whatever the reason is, it's probably why the borisin attacked the ship.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: No wonder the IPC were trying to obstruct our inspection. I'll contact the Ten-Lords Commission and ask the judges to come and give their final verdict on this.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: According to our rules, all prisoners and weapons involving dangerous creatures must be taken to The Shackling Prison for further sentencing. After all, it's the safest place on the Luofu.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: As for you, Mr. craftsman [sic], please go with the Cloud Knights and explain the situation to the judge.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: After a while, everyone disperses and goes their own way
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: I had a feeling that the IPC members would cause trouble, but I didn't think they'd be this tricky. Thanks for your help, Miss Lingsha.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: I should thank you for saving my life. Your sword skills were impressive, taking down that big guy.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: I thought the General's retainers were all burly martial masters. I didn't expect Yanqing to be so...
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Young.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Yeah, exactly. He's young and talented.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Cute.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: Hmm, can't argue with that.
[From Growls to Grace][Narration]: Miniature.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: Huh???
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: As for you, you must be the guests from the Astral Express, right? Saving the Luofu from that crisis, it's so impressive.
[From Growls to Grace][March 7th]: Hehe, it wasn't a big deal, really...
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: It's still early, so why don't we get some tea at the Alchemy Commission? We can discuss your suggestions for revitalizing the commission.
[From Growls to Grace][Yanqing]: I'd be happy to accept your invitation.
[From Growls to Grace][Lingsha]: And you three are coming too, right?
[From Growls to Grace][Stern Cloud Knight]: Nothing to see here. These machines are to be shut down, keep your distance until then.

[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Hey, ! You're back! Why didn't you say anything in the group chat?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: I'm on duty. Let's catch up later.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: You look so pretty when you're serious.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Cut it out. I'm carrying out my sacred duty.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Why are you standing guard here?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Because of someone important. So, stop asking and be serious. I'm on duty right now.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Alright, I'll leave you to it then.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Yeah, see you later.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: ...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: ...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: *laughs* ...Hey, I'm warning you, I'm carrying out my sacred duty! It'll be annoying if you keep cracking jokes like that!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Stop hanging around here and find something better to do. Once I'm done in a few days, call up Lil Gui and Huohuo, and let's grab a meal at Aurum Alley. It's been ages since we hung out.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Goodbye!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Sushang]: Please do not hinder me from carrying out my sacred duty! We can discuss whatever you want after my shift!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Preceptor Servant]: I'm here to pay my respects to the new Cauldron Master.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yuluo]: Cauldron Master Lingsha is busy with official business...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Shehong]: I'm Shehong, a messenger sent by Preceptor Taoran. He wanted to come and congratulate his kindred on becoming Cauldron Master personally, but health limitations hindered his visit.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Shehong]: So, I'm here to pay my respects to the Cauldron Master on his behalf. Could you let her know about my arrival, dear chief alchemist?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yuluo]: Master Lingsha just arrived on the Luofu and is still settling in and getting her work in order. She's quite busy and unable to meet guests right now. Please understand.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Shehong]: Well then... Please pass this humble gift on to her.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yuluo]: I'm pretty sure this "humble gift" from the Preceptor himself is quite valuable. As a mere chief alchemist, I am unable to deliver it. Should any mishap occur, I couldn't bear the consequences.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Shehong]: I see. So when will I be able to see Master Lingsha?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yuluo]: I'm not sure. Whenever Master Lingsha feels it is appropriate, she will most certainly get in touch with you.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Shehong]: Then I shall wait with anticipation.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yuluo]: There you are, Master Lingsha. Just a reminder, the Alchemy Commission on the Luofu has always had a close relationship with the Preceptors, so avoiding a meeting like this doesn't align with our long-standing practices...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Practices? Come on, you make it sound like the "long-standing practices" in this Alchemy Commission are something great.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yuluo]: You're right, Cauldron Master. In this case... I'll continue handling them on your behalf.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Thank you for your help.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Angry Patient]: I've been waiting for years for my turn!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Angry Patient]: And now someone cuts in line?!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Resigned Medic]: Sorry, but it can't be helped...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Resigned Medic]: Don't worry. Your turn will come soon. Please bear with me.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Angry Patient]: Do you have any idea how many years I've waited just to see the Healer Lady? And now someone cuts in line? How is that fair?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Resigned Medic]: Please calm down... That person is an esteemed guest who has traveled from afar. She simply couldn't wait in line for years, so we had to let her see the Healer Lady before you.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Resigned Medic]: But don't worry. As soon as she's done, it'll be your turn. By the way, the esteemed guest said she'll cover your medical expenses as compensation.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Angry Patient]: Well... I guess that's acceptable. Your "esteemed guest" seems reasonable, so I'll just pretend nothing happened.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Resigned Medic]: Thanks for understanding. Please have a rest over here.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: All these years, and the view at the Alchemy Commission hasn't changed a bit.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: The tides come and go, but the ancient sea remains the same. For us Vidyadhara, there's nothing more nostalgic than our homeland.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: ...You're a Luofu native, Miss Lingsha?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Yes, I grew up here, listening to the sound of waves while researching prescriptions with my mentors and peers at the Alchemy Commission.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: It's kind of sad, isn't it? Everything changes but somehow remains familiar. Just like you, Dan Heng, I traveled far from home, and now I've returned. Seeing the familiar scenery brings back a hint of nostalgia.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: The view here would be even better without the Ambrosial Arbor.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Oh, really? I think that towering tree looks pretty impressive.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Even if it's impressive, it's a plaguemark. The Xianzhou have been fighting abominations for thousands of years, and now that the Ambrosial Arbor has been reborn, it's only natural for everyone to feel uneasy.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Well, once a seed is planted, no matter how long it takes, it'll eventually sprout and bear fruit.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: In my humble opinion, the rebirth of the Ambrosial Arbor and the resurgence of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were inevitable. The seed was already planted when the ancestors of the Xianzhou sought immortality.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Why such a serious topic all of a sudden...?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: We can't just make wild speculations about these things, Miss Lingsha.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: I thought we were here to have some tea, but where's the tea?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: My bad. Well, since you went through the entire Ambrosial Arbor Crisis firsthand, Dan Heng and Lieutenant Yanqing, I'd like to discuss something with you.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: What would you like to discuss, Miss Lingsha?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: I was lucky enough to be chosen by the Alliance to come in and clean up all the old grime in the Alchemy Commission.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Honestly, the Alchemy Commission is riddled with problems and has reached a point where fixing it seems impossible. I'm looking to "remedy" this problem, but was wondering if you could provide any insights?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: Well, even though I'm a Vidyadharan like you, I'm an outsider just like my companions here. I can't really say much about a "remedy," but... I do have a piece of advice, Miss Lingsha.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: The Vidyadhara and the Alchemy Commission on the Luofu have always been intricately connected. If you cannot distance yourself from these ties, Miss Lingsha, changing the situation within the Alchemy Commission may be quite challenging.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: I may not know much about politics, but I do know that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus have been operating within the Alchemy Commission for years. If you're determined to root them out, maybe you should discuss it with the general.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: I see. Thank you for your valuable insights.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: While the Lux Arrow from the Reignbow possesses unparalleled power to sever the Ambrosial Arbor, it can't sever mortals' desire to prolong their existence.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Just like how the Cloud Knights can eliminate the remnants of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, but are unable to calm the hearts and minds of the people within the Alchemy Commission.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Our Xianzhou forbears knew this well, and that's why they entrusted the duty of guarding the Roots of the Arbor to the Vidyadhara. However, the Vidyadhara are still only mortal beings.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Thirty years ago, my mentor served as Alchemy Commission's Cauldron Master. She recognized the emerging undercurrents and sought to cleanse the source of the disturbance.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Unfortunately, even though she was skilled in the art of healing, she didn't understand the human heart or how to eliminate the sickness lurking within the depths of the Alchemy Commission. In the end, she was framed and exiled to the Zhuming. I was also implicated and had to leave the Luofu.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: And guess who arbitrated that case and handed down the sentence...? None other than General Jing Yuan himself.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: W-what?!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: You heard it right. The ones responsible for the corruption in the Alchemy Commission are not just the remnants of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, but even the Divine Foresight himself.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Alas, why is your face turning pale, Yanqing?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Don't worry about it. I understand that when someone holds a position of power, they may sometimes have to make tough decisions. I won't hold any personal grudges against him. Besides, at our age, holding personal grudges is a luxury we can't afford.
[The Quieting of Quillons][???]: Lingsha, you're back! I've been waiting ages for you!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Yunli? Why aren't you with your grandpa? What brings you to the Alchemy Commission?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Well, let me take this opportunity to introduce you to Yanqing...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: What a small world...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: You...! You stole my sword! Give it back!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: I see. Let's skip the "introduction" part then.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Why do I keep bumping into you? Are you stalking me or something?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Of course not. Unlike you, Miss Yunli, I have important things to take care of. You, on the other hand, seem to have all the time in the world to wander around without returning my sword.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Grandpa used to say that a sword reflects its master. I talked to your sword, and it told me that you've been distracted. You hesitate when you should strike and struggle to stay calm when your sword is unsheathed...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Now that I see you again, I realize your sword was right. It wasn't me who took your sword. It was you who lost focus.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Do you really expect me to believe that nonsense? I've been taking it easy on you because you're a guest from the Zhuming, but you're not taking the hint. Don't people from the Zhuming know you're supposed to return what you've borrowed?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Just look at this flying sword. Even if I give it back to you now, it'll just be taken away again in a few hours.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: You know the Cloud Knight saying: "A Cloud Knight must never let slip their weapon," yes? Well, sure, I can give it back to you now, but on the battlefield, that's a whole different story. Poor flying sword.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Fine, you don't have to give it back because I'll take it back myself!!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Maybe I should call the general...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: : But which general should I call?
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: Between these two, who do you think is tougher? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Oh, to be young and at the whim of impulse.
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: Between these two, who do you think is tougher? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: Get ready to separate them.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: So, is this the Wardance?
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: Between these two, who do you think is tougher, Dan Heng? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: Get ready to separate them.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: It is my first day at the Alchemy Commission — a brawl is definitely not how I imagined celebrating it.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Well, since you don't approve, I won't draw my sword here.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: I didn't mean it that way. Since you've already drawn your swords, you'd be disappointed if you didn't get to test one another, right?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: I've received reports that the delves near the Alchemy Commission are still infested with abominations. Seems like my predecessors left quite a mess. So, if you two want to determine who's better, why not focus on them instead of each other?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Clearing out some abominations? Meh, sounds boring.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: It's the Cloud Knights' duty to eliminate those abominations. You don't have to ask me twice, Miss Lingsha. I'll help you get rid of them.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Oh, you think you're the only one who knows how to behave? If Lingsha needs anything, I'll gladly draw my sword and help her out.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: It's so heartwarming to see both of you being so sweet and caring. So then, shall we get going?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Let's go!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Wait a second!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Are you all ready?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Let's do it!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Let's wait a moment.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Ever since the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were eradicated, their experimental abominations have been festering here.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: If you want a contest, I'll be the referee. The one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Lingsha, as always, you're still an expert in making unpaid work sound so noble and grand...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: It's for your own good, little Yunli. While you desire to compete against each other, I don't want to see either of you getting hurt.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: That's really thoughtful of you, Cauldron Master.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: So, are you both ready?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Looks like my predecessors left quite a mess.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Let me say it again: The one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Be careful when you draw your swords, and make sure you don't hurt each other.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Can we start now, Lingsha?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Through the clouds, it cleaves a path, Hah!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: To earth, it descends with might, eradicate!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: I didn't expect someone who can't even hold onto his sword to actually have some skill.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: I won't lose to you when it comes to swordplay.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: You've got style with those moves, but you're not striking where it counts. It's such a shame to see you misuse your sword like that.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: She wields her sword with ease. I shouldn't underestimate her.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: I win, Miss Yunli!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: You got lucky.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Why don't you just give me back my sword, sincerely apologize, and then go cry your eyes out to your grandpa?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Consider yourself lucky that I'm not interested in your rusty sword, as I don't have the nasty habit of snatching other people's weapons.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: All you did was chop down a few monsters. Don't get carried away with yourself.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Heh, if you think you can just take this sword from my hand, go ahead and try.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: See? I won.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Your technique was all over the place, and you relied too much on speed. Is this really all the Cloud Knights of the Luofu can muster? So disappointing.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: All you did was chop down a few monsters. Don't get carried away with yourself.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Oh? Well then I'll give you a chance. Defeat me, or hand over all your swords.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: If you're trying to pick a fight, just ask, because I'm ready for you!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Nimble Foxian Lady]: Well fought, my young friends.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Nimble Foxian Lady]: However, both of you have shortcomings. One of you focuses on dodging and weaving, while the other relies on brute strength, trying to take down targets with a single strike.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Who are you?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Nimble Foxian Lady]: Me? I'm just a patient seeking medicine from the Alchemy Commission. A passerby, if you will.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Nimble Foxian Lady]: I thought I'd see my fill of impressive fights during the Wardance — yet here I am, able to witness a remarkable fight at the Alchemy Commission, of all places. Well, the Luofu is never short of surprises.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Nimble Foxian Lady]: However, I have a small suggestion for you. Why don't you settle this dispute fair and square in the Wardance's ring? That way, you can resolve your differences with a proper duel, and put your grudges behind you.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Grudges? No, not at all. Yunli and I... we were just sparring.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Nimble Foxian Lady]: Sparring? You summoned your flying swords, and she swung her sword with full strength. No grudges between you? I don't believe it.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Aha! What brings you here, Lady Feixiao? Have you finished your health consultation with the Dragon Lady?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: Fei... Feixiao? Grandpa always talks about you... Could it be that you are...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: ...The Merlin's Claw of the Xianzhou Yaoqing?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Looks like I'm quite famous on the Xianzhou Luofu, too.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Of course, everyone has heard of the Great General, known to all, and unbeknown to none.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Great General? Isn't that title a bit too narcissistic? I don't like it.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: I heard there's a Dozing General on the Luofu, so I came up with a humble nickname for myself: The "lacking general" — lacking in worries, regrets, and rivals.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Sounds much better, right?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Yeah, that's a befitting title that sounds both humble and impressive.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Now that the sparring session is over, Yanqing and Yunli, shouldn't you politely thank General Feixiao for her guidance and bury the hatchet?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yunli]: ...Here's your sword. Keep it safe, or it might get taken away again. By the way, we haven't settled the score yet. I'll defeat you fair and square next time we fight.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: This is how she apologizes? Now that I finally got my sword back, I should report to the Seat of Divine Foresight. I'll take my leave, General Feixiao.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Oh, by the way, Miss Lingsha, if you've got some free time, I'd like to invite you to the Seat of Divine Foresight for a chat with General Jing Yuan. I think there's more to those "personal grudges" you mentioned earlier...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Thanks for stepping in, General Feixiao. Otherwise, I'd have had to knock them out with my incense.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Not at all, just doing what you asked. How about we call it even as payment for the Healer Lady's consultation?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Lingsha]: Sorry, but even a general needs to pay their bills. We don't do credit here. And let's not forget, you'd have been waiting decades for a chance to see the Dragon Lady if it weren't for me.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Well, you can always send the bill to the Seat of Divine Foresight and say it's for mentoring those kids. After all, it was quite the effort splitting them up, I nearly had to get tough. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find a spot and get some fresh air...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: A moment later, Feixiao leisurely walks to the ancient seaside shore to wait...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Back already? You've met with Jing Yuan and wandered around for a few hours. So, what do you think?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: It appears that the Divine Foresight is using this Wardance as a show of strength to convince everyone that the Luofu is prospering after the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: But... I know you're going to say "But," right?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: But, the influx of people attending the Wardance is like a breeding ground for disorder and rumors. One wrong move, and the Luofu could be in a world of chaos.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Moze]: The Cloud Knights on the streets remain vigilant, so at the very least General Jing Yuan is aware of this. As for other matters, I'm unable to say.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: I'd prefer to be excused from future meetings with generals. I'm just a military healer, and now all of a sudden I'm thrust onto the center stage having cordial chats with two generals?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Moze]: My work doesn't lend itself to being in the limelight, either.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Just stop whining. At least you're in one piece, right?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Before getting in touch with General Jing Yuan, I want to put aside my assumptions and see his "momentum." That includes the overall bearing of the Cloud Knights on the street, what people are saying, and how those close to him behave.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: "The might of an army dwells not within its pawns, but within the force of its collective momentum. Recognizing this fact reveals the true measure of power." Thanks for enlightening me, General.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: A perfectly clear statement turned confusing thanks to your translation — you've made me lose where I was now. Anyway, this is how I operate in battle, so you might as well get used to it.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: Are you treating General Jing Yuan as your enemy?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: The longest-serving general of the Xianzhou Luofu. Do you think he'd have only a few enemies?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: By the way, General, you met the Healer Lady, yes? Could you show me the medicine she prescribed you?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Well, the Healer Lady couldn't do anything about my condition. She just told me to "enjoy some tasty food."
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: ...So, not even the famed Healer Lady could help?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: Don't worry. I'll fulfill my promise and find a way to cure you. Actually, I've found some leads.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Well, life and death, Jiaoqiu, it's all predetermined.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance The Quieting of Quillons.mp4
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: Upon starting my military career, I made a pledge that the rest of my life would be dedicated to being the Xianzhou's spearhead, hunting down the Abominations of Abundance till the end of my days.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: As long as I can fulfill that deep-seated desire... I don't care how long I live.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: You asked if I view General Jing Yuan as my enemy... No, my real enemy has always been myself.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Moze]: "Enjoy some tasty food" So... what's for dinner tonight?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Jiaoqiu]: Geez... you really know how to read the room, don't you?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Feixiao]: You guys figure it out for yourselves. I'm due to catch up with an old war friend I've not seen for quite a long time.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Meanwhile, Yanqing and  return to the Exalting Sanctum.
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: Hey, was that the Yaoqing General who just dropped in out of nowhere? She's so awesome!
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: I mean, when Yunli swung that massive sword, she just casually blocked her attack with ease...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: ...And mine, too.
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: Ahem, yeah... But to go up against Yunli is quite impressive, you know? That aura of heroism and grace. It almost makes me want to learn Xianzhou swordplay!
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: You think so too, right, ?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Yep, those moves were fabulous!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: I agree. General Feixiao is indeed impressive.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: : Uh... I was talking about Yanqing, actually.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Hmmm, that general is totally something else...
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: I agree. General Feixiao is indeed impressive.
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: I was actually hoping you'd give Yanqing some praise!
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Oh, yeah, Xianzhou swordplay is really good! Like really, really good!
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: Can't you put a little more enthusiasm into it?
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: Thanks for the kind words, Miss March. The Wardance is coming up, and I've been chosen to represent the Cloud Knights in the ceremony.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: I've had my fair share of defeats lately, and even though I know there are always more skilled swordmasters out there, seeing General Feixiao's skills today has made me feel a bit uneasy again.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Dan Heng]: Don't underestimate yourself. After all, generals won't fight in the ring during the Wardance. Just remember the state of mind you had when you single-handedly took on me and Blade, putting life and death aside. With that mindset, you can prevail against most challengers.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: I see. Thanks for the advice, Master Dan Heng! By the way, now that today's events are over, General Jing Yuan wants to invite all of you to the Seat of Divine Foresight. He has something important to discuss.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Narration]: Something important?
[The Quieting of Quillons][March 7th]: I bet it's about how to deal with the generals from the Yaoqing and the Zhuming.
[The Quieting of Quillons][Yanqing]: *sigh* I really don't want to get caught up in grown-up games so soon... I just hope Generals Feixiao and Huaiyan can see the truth. We don't need any more chaos on the Luofu before the Wardance.

[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: It's getting late...
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Please, stay a little longer, Elder Huaiyan.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: I've invited some guests from the Express.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Earlier at the Palace of Astrum, I introduced these guests from the Astral Express to you, Elder Huaiyan, but with all the people around, we only exchanged pleasantries. Now, I'd like to officially introduce them to you.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: These three braved great dangers, accompanying me to perilous places, defeating the chief culprit Phantylia, and uncovering the conspiracies of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. If you wish to know more, please feel free to ask us.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Well, I skimmed through the reports about the Arbor's rebirth from the Master Diviner Fu Xuan. She's been summoned to the Yuque for questioning. There are a lot of doubts within the Alliance about this whole situation...
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: ...But despite all that, I believe in you.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Since you joined the ranks, you have repeatedly achieved remarkable feats. After the High-Cloud Quintet each went their separate ways, despite the many criticisms within the Alliance, the Marshal still stood firm against the dissenting voices, and entrusted the Luofu to you.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Over the years, you've served the Alliance with loyalty and wisdom. You've taken down abominations in Thalassa, rescued the Xianzhou Yuque from a siege, and destroyed the demonic planet summoned by the Denizens of Abundance... I still remember those battles vividly.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: There are fools who doubt your loyalty. They're happy to see the Divine Foresight fail because it gives them some kind of sick satisfaction. They haven't achieved anything of their own, so they feed off the failures of others.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: But I've seen enough failures in my time. And I want to believe that your loyalty has never wavered.
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: So, General Feixiao of the Yaoqing is the only one investigating the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis on behalf of the Alliance?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: No, no. I am, too.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: This old man's words... always catch me off guard.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: The Marshal ordered me to come to the Xianzhou Luofu, but the document only says: "Attend the Wardance and listen to Feixiao's questioning."
[By Words of Many][Narration]: What does that mean?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: The Marshal is well aware of Jing Yuan's purpose in holding the ceremony and understands the situation he is facing. She mentioned it because she believes both issues are important.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Since it's the Marshal's orders, do we need to step aside?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: No need for that. You're all important witnesses. The Marshal is well aware of Jing Yuan's purpose in holding the ceremony and understands the situation he is facing. She mentioned it because she believes both issues are important.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Thanks for your kindness and sincerity, Elder Huaiyan, but is it appropriate... to tell everyone here about the Marshal's orders?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: By introducing the Express' witnesses to me alone, aren't you aiming to discern the intentions behind both my actions and Feixiao's, and whether there's any discord between us? Well, since I'm being open and honest with you, I encourage you young folk to do the same.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: As for the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, all I need to do is listen. General Feixiao will be the one asking the questions. To be honest, I'm more concerned about the timely start of the Wardance.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Oh, by the way, I've prepared a gift for the Wardance.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Yes, it's this case right here.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: This case gleams with a muted luster, crafted from a material neither wood nor metal. Its surface is masterfully woven with metallic threads, outlining an intricate pattern of lotus flowers.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: There will be numerous contests and celebrations during the Wardance, and the main event will be the Ringmaster's Challenge.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: The host will dispatch a skilled warrior to take on challengers from all over the cosmos, showcasing the excellent martial arts of the Xianzhou Luofu. When you mentioned that the Astral Express would be attending the ceremony, I thought the high elder of the Luofu would be the ringmaster...
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: You humor me, Elder Huaiyan. The Healer Lady is just a young lady who knows nothing about martial arts. How can I assign her as the ringmaster?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: I'm no match to you when it comes to joking.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: What's this box for? Why don't you open it, General Huaiyan?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: This sword case is intended for the Wardance's award. It's empty now, but in a few days, a precious sword will be delivered and stored inside.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: I don't mean to boast about our skills, but this sword represents the pinnacle of the Zhuming's craftsmanship. It has a legendary history, full of heroic tales from foreign lands, tales that are too detailed to be summarized in just a few words. Since the delegation delivering the sword hasn't arrived yet, I'll just leave the case here for now.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: I've been wondering... who would be worthy of such a sword? And then it hit me — I can award it to the champion of the Ringmaster's Challenge! The ceremony's champion is sure to be a perfect match for the sword.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Moreover, I hear that Yanqing is an excellent swordmaster, and that he will be representing the Luofu as the ringmaster, so it seems like a perfect gift for him.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Thank you for your generosity, Elder Huaiyan.
[By Words of Many][Yunli]: If you want to give me a sword, just say the word, Grandpa. No need to beat around the bush.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: You've got confidence, my girl, but I don't think you can best Yanqing.
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: I know you're all about swords, Miss Yunli. It's just a shame that it's the sword that ultimately chooses its rightful master.
[By Words of Many][Yunli]: Yeah, and even if someone gets their hands on such a precious sword, it'll probably end up in someone else's.
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: The outcome of our duel at the Alchemy Commission is still up in the air. Since you're interested, why don't you represent the Xianzhou Zhuming and challenge me in the ring?
[By Words of Many][Yunli]: That's exactly what I had in mind! Nobody knows who's gonna come out on top! It could be me, could be someone else... It'll probably be me, but whatever happens... it won't be him!
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Looks like Feixiao was right.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: It'll be either death or disaster when these two clash...
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Not to be rude or anything... We've been watching their drama. I'm dying to find out who beats who.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Quiet down! We have other guests here! I've prepared this sword to add some excitement to the ceremony, not to have you two squabble. It's not a good look for the Alliance.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: While you both seem confident that you'll win, you need to remember there can only be one winner and one loser in the ring, which could lead to hard feelings. Actually, I have an idea...
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: We don't know who the winner will be, and it might not be either of you, but if you're eyeing that prize, you'll need to work together. I want you to take on an apprentice who will take part in the Wardance and win at least one match.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Yunli & Yanqing: How does that make sense?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: In my humble opinion, while a Cloud Knight is commendable by securing victories, it's even more so to pass on your skills and spread the way of swordplay.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: I'd be greatly pleased if this apprentice could represent the Express in the Wardance by displaying their Cloud Knight flair and prowess.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Well, Elder Huaiyan's idea is quite interesting. Imparting swordplay skills requires teamwork, and both the winner and the loser will learn a valuable lesson regardless of the outcome. The question is, whom should the two of them take as an apprentice?
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Huh? Who? Wait, me...?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: I noticed just now that Miss March seemed quite interested in the outcome of your sword fight, so I thought why not teach her the art of swordplay?
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: ...Huh? Wait! Are you serious, General?
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Why am I being dragged into this all of a sudden? I've never practiced swordplay before! I'm a total newbie! You really think I can learn it? You'll probably realize I have no hope and give up on me, and that'd be sooo embarrassing!
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Why don't you choose Dan Heng?
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: Things are already complicated enough as they are, .
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: He strikes like lightning... Does Mr. Dan Heng really need anyone's guidance?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: As for Miss March... she's like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Why don't you choose me?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Your talent is quite... unique. Are you also interested in swordplay?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: But you know, based on my years of judging people, you don't really need to dive into swordplay to boost your skills... and I doubt there's anyone out there who can really show you the way forward.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: As for Miss March... she's like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Just accept your fate, March!
[By Words of Many][Narration]: : Isn't this a perfect chance for you? I remember you mentioning that you wanted to learn some sword moves.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Yeah, I did say that, but this is all happening so quickly, don't you think?
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Miss March is like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped. The Wardance is the perfect opportunity to see what heights she can reach.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: I appreciate your kind words, General Huaiyan. But won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of Yanqing and Yunli's time? They should be preparing for the ceremony.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Plus, I heard that each swordmaster has their own special moves. What if they let something slip while teaching me? If everyone knows each other's tactics, won't that make it hard to catch people off guard during the Wardance?
[By Words of Many][Yunli]: That's considerate of you, March 7th. But don't worry. It'll take you at least a decade of hard training before you can even start learning special moves. No need to freak out – a few Zhuming swordplay tricks will mean you'll be more than equipped.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: R-really?
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: Looks like March's curiosity has been piqued.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Heh, the whole point is to know each other's moves. Defeating your opponent in just one move? How boring would that be! Plus, what really decides a swordsman's fate isn't some "special move" — it's the solid fundamentals.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: So, Miss Yunli has already agreed. What do you say, Yanqing?
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: General... I haven't graduated yet. How can I be qualified to teach swordplay to others?
[By Words of Many][Yunli]: So, you're admitting your defeat, huh? If you're not even confident to teach, why don't you let me be the ringmaster instead?
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing, teaching an apprentice is also a way of honing your own skills and gaining insights. You've been an apprentice for years, it's about time you looked at swordplay from another perspective.
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: I see, General. Then count me in!
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Now that Yanqing has agreed too, it all comes down to Miss March giving her nod.
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: It's up to you to make the final decision, March.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Time for you to become the best swordmaster on the Express.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: : At least that way, I won't have to worry about you accidentally shooting me in the butt all the time.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Hey, I've never missed my target!
[By Words of Many][Narration]: It won't be a walk in the park, that's for sure.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Yeah, while I'm smart, learning swordplay sounds like a whole lot of work.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: : It'll be great learning swordplay. That way, I won't have to worry about you accidentally shooting me in the butt all the time.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Hey, I've never missed my target!
[By Words of Many][Narration]: It's all up to you, though.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: I understand.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Then I'm on board! Thank you for your kindness, General Huaiyan.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Great! Starting tomorrow, Yanqing and Yunli will teach you the basics of the Cloud Knights' swordplay.
[By Words of Many][Huaiyan]: Yunli and I are will head out and purchase some sword practice equipment for Miss March. Think of it as a little initiation gift.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Ahaha, you're too kind... Wait, you're giving me a gift? Shouldn't it be the other way round?
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Huaiyan, smiling silently, soon departs Seat of Divine Foresight with Yunli in tow.
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Ah... General Huaiyan's gone. Wait, why does something feel off about what we talked about?!
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Uh... I think we strayed off topic. How did things even get to this point?
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: Yeah, I brought you here because the general said he had some important matters to discuss. But how in the world... did Yunli and I suddenly become Miss March's swordplay mentors?
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: Because... General Huaiyan wants us to stick around on the Luofu for some time.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: But aren't we here to attend the ceremony, anyway?
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: But from his point of view, we're no different from all the other tourists who may leave at any time.
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: Since the Crew's actions were mentioned in the Luofu's operations log were given to the Alliance, he probably wants to see firsthand if we're as capable as the report claims, or if we're just some made-up excuse to save face.
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: And he wants to see it for himself during the Wardance, which is why he even dragged Yunli into this. What began as a simple contest between two swordmasters... has now evolved into you two collaborating to mentor March.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Elder Huaiyan is still that tricky general who likes to give everyone a headache.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: My apologies. Truth be told, I invited all of you to the ceremony because I wished for you to act as my witnesses. I apologize for not disclosing this information earlier.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: In the coming weeks, I'll also invite all of you to a meeting with General Feixiao, where you may need to answer her questions and clear up any doubts she might have. So, please be prepared for the meeting.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: No worries. Answering a few questions is no big deal.
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: Don't worry, General. No matter what happens, I'm prepared to stay here as the Express' witness, and answer any questions.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: Perhaps we should just pack up and leave tonight?
[By Words of Many][March 7th]: Did we do something wrong? We really did save the Luofu, so why do you want to sneak off like we're fugitives?
[By Words of Many][Dan Heng]: Don't worry, . No matter what happens, I'll stay here as a witness and answer any questions she might have.
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Thank you, everyone.
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: General! I know there isn't much I can do to share your burden, but...
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: Hm?
[By Words of Many][Yanqing]: As the Luofu ringmaster, I won't let anyone defeat me in the Wardance!
[By Words of Many][Jing Yuan]: I know.
[By Words of Many][Narration]: In Aurum Alley, Feixiao meets with her old comrade-in-arms whom she hasn't seen for many years
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: The illustrious Merlin's Claw waiting for me, and for so long, too? It's quite an honor. It's been a while, General Feixiao.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: It's been thirty years since we last saw each other, right, Yukong?
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Yes, back then, you were the vanguard of the Yaoqing's Verdant Knights, and I was a pilot of the Luofu's Rainbow Orbit Fleet. Who would have thought that upon meeting again, you'd be a general, and I'd have given up flying... Really does feel like a lifetime ago.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Well, I wouldn't say I haven't seen you in thirty years. After all, your great victories are announced through the Yellowbell Resonance System every day, so I'm well aware of your great feats... How's your health holding up?
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Still stable, I suppose. Do you still remember the medic who saved me in battle?
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: That healer with the odd name and peculiar temperament... What was his name again? Was it Pichu? Or Kaqiu?...
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Jiaoqiu. He's been my retainer and personal healer, delegated by the Alchemy Commission from the Xianzhou Yaoqing. Over the years, he's dedicated himself to managing my "condition." It's thanks to him that I'm still in good health today.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Given my background, I'm happy to have made it this far.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: I'm relieved to know that you're safe and sound. Well then, since you and Elder Huaiyan are here, I imagine you must have received orders from the Marshal?
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: As your friend, may I ask how the Alliance intends to punish the General of the Luofu?
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: The Arbor's rebirth has frightened the elders who lurk behind the scenes... They fear the resurgence of abominations, much like what happened thirty years ago.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Although the report from the Luofu explained all the details, we don't know if the Ruin Legion really invaded, or how exactly the Stellaron Hunters and the Astral Express became involved. This puzzle has many missing pieces.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: As you know, the fugitive Jingliu, who mysteriously disappeared many years ago has resurfaced. This time, she has brought along an outworlder and a coffin, claiming to offer the Marshal "a method to fight against the Aeons."
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: The Luofu Preceptor has also leveled accusations against Jing Yuan for neglecting the Alliance's principles. She asserts that Jing Yuan enabled the exiled Imbibitor Lunae to reenter the Luofu, thereby unlocking the Lunarescent Depths within Scalegorge Waterscape, which in turn disrupted the Vidyadhara's dutiful watch over the Ambrosial Arbor.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: It is for these reasons that I have come here to the Luofu today.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Well, duty calls. Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned all of this to an uninvolved person. But since we once fought together, I didn't want to keep you in the dark. Perhaps pretending you didn't hear any of this would be for the best.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: I understand. I'm sorry, I was out of line. I know I shouldn't be defending General Jing Yuan right now... but, well, you know how I am.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: The Luofu has enjoyed centuries of stability since the end of the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, much of which can be attributed to General Jing Yuan's masterful strategizing.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Unfortunately, for long-life species, enduring through the ages always culminates in a failure that undoes all previous achievements — a moment that our adversaries relish.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: That's true. And that's why I'm also here for another purpose — to visit Hoolay.
[By Words of Many][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance By Words of Many.mp4
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Hoolay? You mean that Hoolay? The borisin Warhead? The same Hoolay who has been imprisoned in the Shackling Prison for over seven centuries?
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: "The nemesis of the foxians, who will never be forgiven and shall be imprisoned until the end of the cosmos..." I can't quite remember the exact wording, but yes, the very same Hoolay.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Usually only emissaries from the Xianzhou Yaoqing's Sky-Faring Commission visit him once every century. Why do you have to visit him now, of all times...?
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: The foxians and the Alliance made a pact to combat the abominations, aiming to achieve justice and free their kin. That werewolf monster is to be forever imprisoned in the dark recesses of The Shackling Prison, facing unending retribution.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Given the situation on the Luofu, those on the Yaoqing are concerned about Hoolay's imprisonment. I'm afraid that the routine visit every century is no longer sufficient to ease their concerns.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: That's why I was sent here — to reassure them.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: It's all bad news.
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: Well, not everything. There might be a silver lining. By the way, I've found some clues about the thing you asked for.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Tell me more!
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: The Verdant Knights followed the route you mentioned and discovered the wreckage of the Whistling Flames ship. Unfortunately, there were no survivors, and no cargo.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: ...
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: However, someone had already been on the scene before we arrived.
[By Words of Many][Yukong]: Our people? Or someone from the IPC?
[By Words of Many][Feixiao]: No, neither. Yukong, have you heard of a person named Ruan Mei?

[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: After a day of running around, you finally arrive at Petrichor Inn for a well-deserved rest...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: This night, your restlessness from meeting the general and the bustling crowd before the Wardance keeps you from falling asleep.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Day two.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: : I'm still feeling sleepy...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: : Hmm, did I oversleep? Where did March and Dan Heng go?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: There you are, .
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Why are you here too, Yanqing?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: You haven't forgotten about our promise to General Huaiyan, have you? I woke up especially early, so I could start teaching Miss March swordplay.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: What kind of master waits on their apprentice's doorstep?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Well, it was a promise to General Huaiyan, after all. I woke up especially early, so I could start teaching Miss March swordplay.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: March? Show some respect to your master.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: It's an honor to learn from you, Master Yanqing!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: In all those immersias and novels I watched, when apprentices want to pay their respects to their masters, they usually bring fancy gifts, kneel, and bow. I'm really sorry, but I haven't prepared anything yet.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Hey, why are you blushing, Master Yanqing?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: This is the first time someone has called me master... I need to... get used to it...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Let me make it clear: Swordplay training is about improving your body, mind, and strength. It's not a casual game you can master overnight.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: I promised General Huaiyan that I'd teach you Cloud Knight swordplay, so you can participate in the Wardance and defeat at least one opponent. I'll do my best, but if you break your master's rules...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: W-what will you do?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Is it too late for regrets? I'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: ...Honestly, I'm not sure what I'll do either, because I've never been a teacher before. So, Miss March, please behave and don't skip classes or complain.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: : You need to toughen up and train her properly, Master Yanqing. Don't go easy on her.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: You're so heartless, .
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: March is always a good girl!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Fine. A promise is a promise. Since I promised to study hard, I'll do my best starting today!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Great! That's the spirit.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Dan Heng]: March is in your hands now, Yanqing. Don't be too easy on her.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Dan Heng, do you even have a heart? Did you lose it somewhere?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: By the way, where's Yunli?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: I've found a quiet spot in the back garden of the Palace of Astrum for our first lesson together.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: March 7th waves to you and Dan Heng, embarking on the first lesson of her sword training journey...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Switching to March 7th's POV...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: With the encouragement of General Huaiyan — deliberate or accidental notwithstanding — March 7th seized the unexpected opportunity to learn the art of Xianzhou swordsmanship and to perform in the Wardance ceremony...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Seriously? It's the first day, and you two are already late? Why is everyone on the Luofu so laid-back? So disappointing.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Ah, Master Yunli you're already here. Sorry for keeping you waiting!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Wait, were you trying to teach her in secret? That's sneaky!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: I'm just showing you what Luofu etiquette is all about. She might be my apprentice, but it's customary for the master to personally escort their apprentice to the place of learning.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: As the host, I'll be teaching Miss March the essence of Luofu swordplay, after which she'll emerge victorious in the Wardance ring. You won't be complaining about Luofu swordplay then!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Stand aside, rookie. Let me show you how we Zhuming swordmasters treat their apprentices.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Quickly, over here, Miss March. This is a "reverse mentorship gift" from me to you. I hope you put it to good use.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: What's this... Xianzhou clothing? It's so beautiful!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Sword practice requires precise movements. This outfit is tailored to fit perfectly and allows for smooth movements. I even added some small accessories. I put a lot of thought into it.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: You're awesome, Master Yunli!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: See? See? How can you compete with me? I'll teach March 7th the essence of Zhuming swordplay, so she can win the contest with my sword skills.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Actually, I've prepared something too.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Huh? You have a gift for me too, Master Yanqing?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Since you want to learn swordplay, Miss March, you'll need suitable weapons. So, I went out of my way to prepare a pair of swords overnight.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Unfortunately, I didn't have time to ask the craftsman to customize the swords for you, but I did my best to choose ones that look nice and are suitable for a beginner. I hope you like them, Miss March.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Thank you, Master Yanqing!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Bet you didn't see that coming, did you, Yunli?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Hmph, the real competition is just getting started.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: I'm so lucky to have two great masters! But why does it feel like things are getting a bit weird?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Moments later
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: So, what do you think, masters? Does this outfit suit me?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Perfect! I chose it carefully — it's perfect for beautiful young swordswomen like you and me!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Alright, let's get started with the training. The person next to me is a Cloud Knight instructor I've brought in. For your first lesson, try exchanging a couple of moves with him.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Wait, we're having actual combat training for the first lesson?! Isn't that a bit too intense?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Well, I heard you have some experience with archery and martial arts. The first thing we're going to do is see just how strong your fundamentals are.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Come on, step forward and strike with the sword in the most natural way you can think of! It's important for us to grasp your natural movements, so we can decide where to start and what you need to learn.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Cloud Knight Instructor]: If you're ready, let's begin!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Ah... haha... okay...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: 
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: 
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Alright, let's get started with the training. The person next to me is a Cloud Knight instructor I've brought in. For your first lesson, try exchanging a couple of moves with him.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Well, I heard you have some experience with archery and martial arts. The first thing we're going to do is see just how strong your fundamentals are.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Come on, step forward and strike with the sword in the most natural way you can think of! It's important for us to grasp your natural movements, so we can decide where to start and what you need to learn.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Cloud Knight Instructor]: Are you ready?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: I'm ready...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Yeah, I'm ready... but please go easy on me!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Cloud Knight Instructor]: Then I apologize in advance, Miss March!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Not really...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: I need some more time to prepare myself...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Cloud Knight Instructor]: No rush! Take your time!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Please have some tea, masters!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Pay close attention, Miss March.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Luofu swordplay is all about being swift and agile in your movements.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Ignore him. Strength is everything!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Like this?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Well done!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: With a true heart and focused mind — here I come!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Azure Dragon, White Tiger, eating less carbs!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: What are you mumbling about?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Isn't this... a sword technique? Shouldn't I be saying something cool?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: I'm starting to get the hang of it.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Alright, check out this move!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: I didn't expect the first lesson to be so intense...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Miss March has quick hands and a flexible body. She's a perfect fit for practicing Luofu swordplay.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: However, she lacks strength, and her strikes were a bit unfocused... but don't worry, that's totally normal for beginners. Once she starts practicing Zhuming swordplay, she'll make heaps of progress.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Given the situation, I believe Miss March should start by working on —
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Yanqing & Yunli: Her footwork. Her strength.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Seriously, do you actually know anything about swordplay or what?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: I could ask you the same thing! Dual swords require agility, so what's more important than footwork?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Instead of focusing on her strengths, we should address her weaknesses. The drawback of wielding two swords is not generating enough force. What good is being quick on your feet if you don't have strength? It's not like we're dancing here.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Skilled swordmasters know how to play to their strengths and work on their weaknesses. Start with what you're good at, then tackle your weaknesses. That's the right way to learn.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: You're quite the theorist, huh?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Theorist? You claim to be able to talk to swords, so what does that make you? A lunatic?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Hey, it's only my first lesson, and you're already arguing! Come on, calm down, masters! I'll have to improve both my footwork and strength anyway, so it doesn't matter which one comes first!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Yanqing & Yunli: But it does matter!!! Just listen to me, March 7th!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: ...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Thus begins the journey of March 7th's sword training.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: March 7th )
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Time marches on, and days turn to more...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Dear Himeko, Mr. Yang, and Pom-Pom, We're all good here on the Xianzhou Luofu, so no need to worry! By the way, how's your trip going?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: As for me, I've somehow become the apprentice to two Cloud Knight swordmasters, and I've been honing my sword skills with their guidance.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: One of them is Yanqing, the boy we've all met before. The other is Yunli, the granddaughter of General Huaiyan from the Xianzhou Zhuming.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: I tried to drag  into this, but  refused. Then I tried to rope Dan Heng in, but Master Yanqing wouldn't have it.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Still, I didn't let the difficulty get to me. In just a few weeks, my sword skills have improved a lot. Both my masters think I have unique talents in swordplay and are literally fighting each other to teach me their skills.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Thanks to their guidance, I've actually made some progress. When I get back to the Express, I'll definitely show off my skills and impress you all!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Looking forward to your reply. Yours, March 7th.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Days and nights fly by in the delve, as the Wardance fast approaches.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Under the strict supervision of her two masters, March 7th trains tirelessly, almost developing tennis elbow.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: On that day, after the sword training...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Well done. Let's call it a day.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Miss March's sword skills are really coming along. She'll hold her own just fine in the Wardance.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Maybe I have a chance of defeating my masters?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Perhaps... I might have a shot at beating both masters in the ring?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Get real, you've only been practicing for a short while. How could that possibly happen?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: With your talent, Miss March, if you dedicate a few more decades to training, you might eventually be able to defeat Yunli.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Bah!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Decades...? But I'll be an old lady by then... No, no.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Just watch, I'll win a fight when the time comes!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Just you wait and see! I'll show off my skills in the ring and win a match. I'll make both of you proud!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Can you believe it? March 7th has actually become a pretty decent swordmaster in such a short time. Now I understand why grandpa always had a grin on his face while training me.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Are you sure he wasn't laughing at you?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Shut up!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: It's all thanks to your amazing guidance, masters!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Miss March, you're really getting the hang of wielding dual swords. If you're keen on advancing, trying out different Xianzhou blades could improve your touch.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Hmm, let me see... Which sword is the most powerful? Single sword? Greatsword? Or maybe a flying sword?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: There's no such thing as the "most powerful" sword. It's all about the skill of the swordmaster. Yanqing wields several flying swords, while I only wield one, but remember how I kicked his butt at the Alchemy Commission?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: First, you didn't kick my butt! Second, you'll never kick my butt! Third, how about we settle this right now and see who kicks whose butt?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Yeah, I'm up for that! And if I kick your butt, you'll drop out of the Wardance. Deal?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Why are you two arguing again? I thought things had been improving between you lately...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: There was talk that the leading disciples of the Luofu and Zhuming generals were supposed to face off in the Wardance, but for some reason, they suddenly teamed up to train an apprentice of their own. Turns out the rumors are true.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Tomorrow is the big day of the Wardance. Shouldn't you two be focusing on honing your skills instead of teaching swordplay here?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Ah, you're... um, you're... That's right! You're the pink-haired fox from the Yaoqing!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: This is Mr. Jiaoqiu.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: This is Mr. Jiaoqiu, the healer working for the General of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: *chuckle* "Pink-haired fox..."
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Hahaha...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: What are you laughing at? You've got pink-hair, too!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: I'm Jiaoqiu, the healer working for the General of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Ah, got it. So, you're the participant attending the Wardance on behalf of the Yaoqing, and you were trying to sneak a peek at our training?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Sorry for the misunderstanding. I don't know anything about martial arts. I'm just here on the general's orders to take care of some official business. I didn't mean to interrupt your training. I'll be on my way.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: If you know nothing about martial arts, why were you smirking earlier?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Well, my curiosity got the better of me I suppose. When I heard Miss March's pondering about what to learn, I couldn't help but wander over.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: From my professional experience, cleavers, slicers, chopping knives, and carving knives are all just tools, kind of like frying, sautéing, boiling, and deep-frying in cooking. They're just ways for people to show off their skills. How you use them really depends on the ingredients you're working with
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: It's like your sword teaching methods. If you align your "ingredient" — in other words your apprentice's natural tendencies with the right "cooking method" — by which I mean the teaching method that best suits her, she'll make double the progress in half the time!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: For example, Golden Eggplant tastes best when fried, Cloud Peppers when stir-fried, and Yellow Boulder Beef when simmered. It's all about discovering the nature of the ingredients... uh, I mean, apprentice.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: I'm getting hungry.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: I'm getting hungry.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: I'm getting hungry.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: All this talk about food is making me hungry.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Aren't you a healer? Why are you talking about food?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Well, it's just a metaphor. The medicinal school I follow on the Xianzhou Yaoqing is called the Ranzhi School, that specializes in food therapy, so it's only natural that I know a thing or two about cooking.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: So... you're the general's cook?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: I'm a healer! But anyway, a cook who isn't interested in health doesn't make for a good advisor. Fine, call me a cook if you want.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Seeing the way you're looking at me, it's obvious you think I'm just some feeble academic who likes to blabber on about martial arts. But in reality, I know a thing or two about killing. After all, the art of healing inherently encompasses both life and death.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Why suddenly getting all serious with kids?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Why is this guy suddenly getting all serious with kids?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Seems like he just got offended...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Seriously, trying to save face in front of kids? *sigh*
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Do you recognize this bottle of medicine in my hand?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Yanqing & Yunli & March 7th: No.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: This is called "Tumbledust!" An extract from an exotic flower named "Yabruh."
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Is it poison?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Well, it depends on how it's used. With just one drop, it's able to numb a patient's body during surgery, making them painless throughout the entire process. However...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Increase the dose or the potency, and it'll slow the metabolism, making the blood thin and resulting in the loss of all senses. Even long-life species cannot escape its effects.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: This thing can save lives or take them. It's more powerful than the swords in your hands.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: That may be so, but still I prefer settling things with a sword than... you know...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Looks like I did get you all wrong. You're not a feeble scholar, but a sinister and despicable one.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Hey, hey, why the insults all of a sudden? I'm just sharing some medical knowledge here, not persuading you to poison anyone.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Seems like you get real excited when talking about poison. I can't tell if that's an honorable thing or sinister...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Picture this: Two individuals, the one standing is full of malice, the other lying down is honorable and righteous. How can the one who's lying down label the one standing as "sinister?"
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: In the throes of combat, where life and death hinge on a singular moment, every idea fades into nothingness. The only thing that matters is "staying alive."
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Surviving the battlefield reshapes all notions of worth. Be it integrity or treachery, in my eyes, their significance is negligible.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Perhaps you've underestimated Yunli and me, Mr. Jiaoqiu. We may be young, but we've seen our fair share of war.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Well, well, then you should know that the Wardance is nothing more than a contest. So, why are you so focused on it?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: When I was appointed as the ringmaster for the Wardance, I asked the general: "We Cloud Knights are supposed to charge into the fray and slay enemies. Why do we have to swing swords in a ring just to please an audience?"
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: And this is how the general replied: "To unsheathe your sword in a ring is no different than on the battlefield, as your sword reveals the might of all Cloud Knights."
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: The Wardance is the perfect chance to showcase martial virtue and forge alliances from all over the cosmos. When we unsheathe the sword without drawing blood, we not only display our might but also the martial virtue of the Cloud Knights.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: That's quite an insightful statement, Yanqing. Well, my apologies for being so short-sighted. I've been on the Luofu for quite some time, but I haven't had the chance to see the ceremony venue for myself yet.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Hearing you speak so highly of it has piqued my curiosity. Would you mind showing me around?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: You want to see the Skysplitter ship where the Wardance will be held? Let's go! I bet Yunli and Miss March haven't seen it either, right? Well then, I'll give you all a tour.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Surviving the battlefield reshapes all notions of worth. Be it integrity or treachery, in my eyes, their significance is negligible.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Can you believe it? March 7th has actually become a pretty decent swordmaster in such a short time. Now I understand why grandpa always had a grin on his face while training me.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Let's go. I'll give you a tour of the Skysplitter.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Looks like a lot of other visitors have also come to catch a glimpse of the Skysplitter.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: What's up, Mr. Jiaoqiu?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: No... it's nothing.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Do you see that airship in the distance? That's the Skysplitter, the venue for the Wardance ceremony.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: It doesn't look all that impressive from this distance.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: The Skysplitter is actually a decommissioned Luofu military vessel. People aren't allowed on board until the Wardance officially commences.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Tomorrow, when the bell rings and the ceremonial cannons roar, I'll be there representing the Cloud Knights of the Xianzhou Luofu, standing in the ring, ready to take on challengers from all over the cosmos.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Since I was a kid, I've been training in swordplay and the art of war under the General. Every day I'd swing my sword ten thousand times, and then thrust it ten thousand times, repeating the process over and over...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: I understand that I'm not like other kids. I never envied the toys and freedom they all had. I never found sword practice boring or hard.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Even in the thick of battle, facing down savage abominations, I never felt scared.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Each day, I could feel myself getting stronger and stronger... and I racked up countless victories. It's the best feeling in the world.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: But then, I faced a really tough opponent, and just one slash shattered my confidence into a thousand pieces. That's when I felt true fear for the first time. Maybe that's what Mr. Jiaoqiu meant by "life and death hinge on a singular moment, every idea fades into nothingness?"
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: After that, I had to pick up the pieces and try to put myself back together. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to find my old, happy self again.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: I often ask myself, why do I wield my sword? If defeat is inevitable, why do I continue to fight? Is it to reclaim the joy of victory, to meet the general's expectations, or to secure my honor among the Cloud Knights?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: While the general could teach me the art of swordplay, he couldn't teach me why I should keep on going. He said the reason must come from within myself. I've been struggling to find that reason.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: But after talking with you, Mr. Jiaoqiu, I think I already have that reason in mind.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: As a member of the Cloud Knights and the general's apprentice, I've had a weight on my shoulders, and I know there's still more to shoulder.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: But when I wield my sword, it feels like I'm letting go of everything. I love the feeling of giving it my all, facing any obstacle in front of me, pressing forward.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: That's why I wield my sword.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Oh, Yanqing, so young, yet so grown-up... By the way, how old are you exactly?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Age doesn't really matter. All swordmasters will understand how I feel.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Hmm... I get it. Looks like all the kids on the Luofu live tough lives. So, how about you, Miss Yunli?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: It's not polite to ask a girl her age, no matter which Xianzhou ship you're on.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: I'm not asking your age! I'm asking if you have a dream like Yanqing has?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: You don't talk like a cook, you sound more like a TV host or something.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: ...Need I repeat myself again? I'm a healer.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Well, I... I don't have a dream like Yanqing does. The only reason I'm participating in the Ringmaster's Challenge is because I made a promise to my grandfather that I'd win the precious sword he's contributed to the Wardance.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Sounds like that mind of yours is just filled with swords.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: I bet you've got nothing better on your mind!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: My... father... was a craftsman on the Xianzhou Zhuming. Because of his foolishness, many innocent people fell victim to the cursed swords he forged.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Since I was a kid, it's been clear to me that not everyone deserves to have a weapon in their hands. Giving them a sword is no different than being cruel to the innocent.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: So, whenever I come across someone unworthy of a sword, I can't help but want to take it away from them. Given that Yanqing is the Wardance ringmaster, I'm stepping up to challenge him, to ensure the precious sword doesn't fall into the hands of an unworthy master.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Hey! What do you mean by "an unworthy master"?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: I see. It's not easy for kids on the Zhuming either.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Well, it's better to have a reason for wielding a sword than to be lost and confused. I've saved countless Cloud Knights in my life, and there are plenty of exceptional warriors just like the two... of you...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: What happened, Mr. Jiaoqiu?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: ...Oh, nothing. I was just reminded of some old friends and old tales.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Judging from my professional perspective as a healer, both of you possess remarkable vitality, your energies flow like raging fires and mighty gales. The upcoming fight... will definitely be impressive.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: Well, we've seen the Skysplitter and toured the Stargazer Navalia. I guess it's time to say goodbye for now.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: What, you're leaving already? But you haven't asked me about my dreams! I've been working hard too, you know!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: It's getting late, Miss March. Unlike you lot, I'm a grown-up bound by responsibilities and duties. The tasks entrusted to me by the general won't complete themselves.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: By the way, Yanqing, is it normal to have so many people wandering around in an automated area like the Stargazer Navalia?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: ...Actually, this is a restricted area, but since you're all guests, I made an exception so you could take a look around.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Jiaoqiu]: I understand. Well, I'll take my leave. I wish you both the best of luck in the ring tomorrow.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Jiaoqiu waves and then leaves
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][March 7th]: Seriously... I just spent so much time thinking about my dream, but he didn't even ask me!
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: Now that we're done with our tour of the Skysplitter, shall we continue with our training?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Why don't we take a day off?
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yunli]: What? You want to secretly practice swordplay by yourself? Dream on.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Hmph, you know cramming before a fight never works out.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: For some reason, seeing the Skysplitter has boosted my confidence. So, I've decided to conserve my strength for tomorrow.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Yanqing]: Alright, I'll take you out of the Stargazer Navalia.
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[March to Mastery: A Star Is Born][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Craftsman]: ...Oh, just shut up, Red Fang! This is not a beast ship, I need some time to take care of things
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: You willingly donned the skin of a lowly beast to join this mission, dedicating yourself to our glorious cause. And now you're telling me you can't handle it? Do you realize how many ships we need?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Craftsman]: I'm doing my best, alright? It takes time to figure all this out.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: When the guns go off tomorrow, all eyes will be on it. That'll be our only chance...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Harr-zaa-xi? W-who's there?!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Who are you guys?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Craftsman]: An impromptu inspection. Why are there outsiders loitering in Stargazer Navalia? And a bunch of kids at that!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Hey, kids, didn't your parents ever tell you to stay away from the Stargazer Navalia? I know it's an automated facility, but it doesn't mean you can just break in and do what you want.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: I'll take the little ones away right now.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: Ah, sorry, I'll take the little ones away right now.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Who are you calling "kids?"
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: First of all, I'm an adult. Second, I didn't just break in...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Yeah, we flew here on a starskiff! Like... woosh!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Well, I'm not trying to tell you off, but this place is off-limits to the public, you know?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Big sis! Let's go! I want to play in Ever-Hunt Plains!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: Huh? Ever-Hunt Plains? Uh... yeah, sure! Big sis will take you there.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Xuu haa... You should have let me...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Shhh, the overhaul is done, and everything looks good. We should leave.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: Could you repeat what you just said, Yanqing?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: What did I say?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: Big sis! Let's go! I want to play in Ever-Hunt Plains!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Come on. Can't you read the room? Something is definitely off about the three people we just met.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: Yeah, anyone could see that. I just wanted to hear you say it again.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: That pink-haired fox tried to say something. I'm pretty sure he sensed something fishy. Since he's not familiar with this place, he just dropped us a hint, but you didn't seem to be paying attention at all.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: I knew that from the beginning!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: That Cloud Knight... didn't recognize Master Yanqing?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: That Cloud Knight didn't recognize Master Yanqing at all... That's really weird.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: What, is he famous on the Luofu or something? Not even the Cloud Knights on the Zhuming, who all know my glorious name, might recognize my face.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: You have a point.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Looks like they were tampering with the starskiff production line, huh?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: They said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: And it's suspicious how they suddenly finished their "overhaul" and walked away as soon as they laid eyes on us.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: A Cloud Knight, a member from the Sky-Faring Commission, and a craftsman... They're from various departments, and the reason for the overhaul seems legit, but one of them blurted out some weird language just now. Did you hear that?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: I have a feeling that if we secretly tail them, we'll definitely catch these guys in the act.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Follow my lead, and be careful not to blow our cover.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Don't get too close, Miss March! They might spot you!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: Never mind who they are, let's just film them.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: We should have just killed those lowly beasts.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Those little brats won't take up much space. There are boxes all over this place. Just dump them into one and no one will notice.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Cut the theatrics, Grulok. Even the slightest slip-up could interfere with Lord Mok Tok's plans.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: So, where are we heading next?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: To check the freight skiffs. We've got a lot of preparations to do. Also, don't forget to take those crates with you.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Weapons, supplies... we've got to be well-prepared. Otherwise, we're screwed.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: So, are they... smugglers? What exactly are they up to?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: I have no clue, but they seem to be moving those crates. I've got an idea. We can hide inside the crates and follow them.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: Ugh, it's so cramped in here...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: I can hardly breathe.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Just hang in there...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: You hear footsteps pacing back and forth beside the crate. If someone were to open the crate at that moment, they would certainly catch you in your ridiculous hiding position. Fortunately, that doesn't happen.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: The floating mechanism at the bottom of the crate is activated. You feel it begins to drift slowly forward.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: After what feels like an entire Amber Era of holding breath in silence, you heard the sound of the crate touching down.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Craftsman]: Let's just put the cargo here for now, alright? Then we'll move on to inspect the ships.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Craftsman]: Lord Mok Tok said that as soon as we're done, we're to board the freight skiff and leave this place.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Don't worry. I've changed the shipping schedule. You two, come with me.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Is it just me? I keep smelling that stench of lowly beasts everywhere we go.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Don't be so paranoid.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: The departing footsteps sound like a signal, prompting you to breathe a sigh of relief.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Looks like they're planning to escape on the skiffs in Stargazer Navalia.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: They're keep talking about their "plans," but where did they come from? And what do they want to do on the Xianzhou?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: They're definitely up to something bad. Wait, they disappeared? Let's catch up to them!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Where are you going, Miss March? Follow them!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Tread softly, breathe quietly...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: And make sure to keep an eye on them. Hide out of sight as soon as there's any sign of activity.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Keep looking...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Pay attention to your surroundings.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: There's quite a number of things to prepare...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: The ship is paramount.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Mok Tok's request must be seen to.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Understood.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Did he spot us? Quickly, hide!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Watch out! They're on high alert!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: I knew something was off. There's always this stench of lowly beasts in the air...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Looks like those brats were following us the whole time.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Why are they coming back? Quickly, retreat!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: You were discovered by the target... maybe give it another try.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Don't be so paranoid! We're running out of time. Get over here!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Xuu harr, I'm coming!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: They're leaving. We should catch up to them, quickly!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: What are they up to? They're all wearing official uniforms, but I'm pretty sure they're not members of the Sky-Faring Commission, the Artisanship Commission or the Cloud Knights... This is way too suspicious.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: Never mind who they are, let's just film them. That way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Look at this, a freight starskiff with enough room to fit at least twenty of my men. I'll let the others know and have them prepare more starskiffs.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Once we're past the checkpoint, there will be beast ships waiting for us.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Lord Mok Tok is ready. The revival of our ancient bloodline all hinges on this operation...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: What did he just say?... Beast ships?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Sky-Faring Commission Member: Who's there?!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: It's those brats! I told you to get rid of them, but you didn't listen, you idiot!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Wipe them all out!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: Borisin?!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Borisin]: Adusa! Die, you lowly beasts!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: How is this possible? How did these foxians... change their appearances like that?!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: They're not foxians at all. They revealed their true form. They're borisin, just like the bandits I defeated on the IPC ship.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Wait, that means...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: The borisin have infiltrated the Xianzhou...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: How did the borisin manage to infiltrate the Xianzhou?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: How did the borisin disguise themselves as foxians?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: What kind of trick did they use? When we were tracking them earlier, they looked just like normal Xianzhou foxians...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: It's not just a simple disguise of wearing our clothing and shaving their whiskers. They're somehow able to alter their appearance to be indistinguishable from foxians.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: They even have official IDs for the Sky-Faring Commission, the Artisanship Commission, and... even the Cloud Knights?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Let me check this fake Cloud Knight's tag. Maybe it'll give us some clues.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: Lujun? An officer of the patrol defense squad... Wait!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yunli]: What's the matter?
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: I encountered a patrol officer named Lujun before. It was a few weeks ago when we were transporting the borisin prisoners.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: If they can forge official identities and move around the Xianzhou without raising suspicion... Oh no, this is bad.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][March 7th]: Even worse. If you find one cockroach on the Express, it usually means...
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: There are more borisin hiding on the Xianzhou. I bet their plan is much bigger than just stealing information.
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Yanqing]: We've got to report this to the Seat of Divine Foresight!
[A Startlement of Fur and Feathers][Narration]: Meanwhile, in the Seat of Divine Foresight...

[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: I am glad to finally meet you in person, guests from the Astral Express. I'm Feixiao, the general of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: Let me introduce our guests to you. The one dressed in green...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: He's the reincarnation of Imbibitor Lunae, and the person behind him is the newest member of the Crew. I've heard a lot about you.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Outside the reports from the Luofu, the Sky-Faring Commission of the Yaoqing has also gathered plenty of information about both of you. I've been eager to meet you face to face, for reasons that... I'm sure General Jing Yuan has explained, right?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Yeah, we're here to answer your questions as witnesses.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: That's right, but don't worry, this isn't a trial. I just want to have a chat with you and get a better understanding of the facts.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: General Jing Yuan didn't tell us about your intentions at all...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: He didn't? That doesn't sound like the Divine Foresight I know.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: Don't worry. Just tell her the truth.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: You're here about the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection, no?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Straight to the point. I like it.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: According to General Jing Yuan's report, the Ruin Legion is to blame for the Ambrosial Arbor crisis, and all Arbiter-Generals should pay attention to the Ruin Author's movements.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Over the years, the Destruction's minions have wreaked havoc on countless worlds, and the Alliance has been keeping an eye on them. But no one expected them to join hands with the remnants of the Abundance.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: The damage caused by the Ambrosial Arbor crisis was far less severe than expected, which is good news for us. However... it was quite different from the Ruin Legion's usual style of destroying life wherever they go.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: While I trust the bravery of the Divine Foresight and the Nameless, I'm curious about some details missing from the report. I'd like to take this chance to have an exchange with both of you.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Let me be clear, the questions I'll ask might not reflect my actual thoughts. So, please don't take offense if any of my questions seem a bit harsh.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Please go ahead, General. But keep in mind we can only answer based on what we know. And perhaps... you already have the answers to your questions in your heart.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: You have a clever tongue. I like it.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: :
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Opponent information]: 
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Feixiao
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: The Cloud Knight General from the Xianzhou Yaoqing.She came to "observe" the Wardance under the orders of the Marshal. However, the true purpose of her trip is to observe the situation on the Luofu after the Ambrosial Arbor crisis.The first impression of this general is that she is straightforward and stern. Therefore, trying to deceive her is probably not a good idea.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Could you please give us another chance? I'd like to answer that question again.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: No problem, but remember that a debate is like a duel. The more you hesitate, the farther you are from victory.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Let's cut to the chase. Before the crisis struck, the Astral Express was guided here by a Stellaron Hunter, a wanted felon, in an attempt to resolve the Stellaron Crisis.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: However, everyone in the Cosmos knows of the Stellaron Hunters' reputation. So, why did you place so much trust in them? Could it be that some of you have a connection with them?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: It all comes down to the Stellaron.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Apart from the Luofu, there are many other worlds suffering from Stellaron corrosion. For example, Jarilo-VI, the world that the Express stopped at before reaching the Luofu, was one of them.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: To the Express, Stellarons act as roadblocks on the silver rail and pose risks to the warping process. And that's why dealing with Stellaron issues is part of the duty of the Nameless.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Ah, I've heard about those problems caused by Stellarons. The Express connects various worlds, so it makes sense for you to take care of this. The Cosmos is a mess, and the Trailblazers are just doing their best to fix it. I understand.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: We are the good guys.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : What's wrong with doing something good? Along the way, we've helped countless worlds... well, not literally countless, but you get the idea!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : The Stellaron Hunters warned us that if we didn't hurry to the Xianzhou Luofu, half of its inhabitants would die.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Your good intentions are commendable, just like the Cloud Knights' determination to eliminate those abominations. Even though there are always people who remain skeptical, I won't question your motives.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Raise her suspicion about your relationship with Stellaron Hunters.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : You know what? Maybe I do have a connection with Stellaron Hunters...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Oh...? Now that's interesting.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Looks like you're quite close to the Stellaron Hunters. However, I must warn you that they are wanted felons. While I appreciate your honesty, being honest about this topic might make you look suspicious to some, you know?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Talk about Elio's prophecy.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Rumor has it that Elio, the leader of the Stellaron Hunters, possesses the power to see into the future.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : He foresaw that the Xianzhou and the Express would have important roles to play in the war against Nanook. That's why we were lured here to the Luofu, to deal with the Stellaron crisis and fulfill the prophecy.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: General Jing Yuan believes in this prophecy too, as mentioned in the report. I'm curious why you didn't question it at all?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Could it be because one of the Stellaron Hunters is actually an old acquaintance of General Jing Yuan?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: ...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: Please be cautious with your words, Merlin's Claw. Let's avoid sowing doubt among our comrades. That Stellaron Hunter used to be my disciple, so are you putting my loyalty in question, too?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: I'm simply bringing up the doubts about General Jing Yuan that exist within the Alliance. Since I'm representing them, perhaps you can just imagine me as one of those old geezers?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Let's move on to the next question. The report suggests that Dan Shu, the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, colluded with the Lord Ravager and used the power of the Stellaron to resurrect the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: But here's the thing: Dan Shu was just a chief alchemist. Even if she colluded with our enemies and summoned the Stellaron, how did she manage to bypass the Vidyadhara guards around the Ambrosial Arbor?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: The Preceptors of the Luofu seem suspicious.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : The answer seems rather simple, doesn't it? The Preceptors of the Luofu abandoned their duty to guard the Ambrosial Arbor and colluded with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: That's a possibility, but there's another scenario to consider: General Jing Yuan brought back Mr. Dan Heng, who had been in exile for a long time. As a result, Dan Heng parted the Seas, eventually leading to the resurrection of the Ambrosial Arbor.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: I never intended to trespass on the Xianzhou ship, but...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: If you had no intention to trespass, then why did you return to the Xianzhou ship before your exile was lifted?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: I was concerned about the safety of my companions, so I had to act brazenly. I alone bear the blame.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Please don't worry, Mr. Dan Heng. If someone must be held accountable, it won't fall solely on your shoulders.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: I've personally met Dan Shu.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : I personally met Dan Shu once. Her closest friend was killed during the war on the Fanghu, and she harbored deep hatred towards The Hunt. So she spent years making preparations in the Alchemy Commission, in order to take revenge on the Xianzhou.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Revenge... is also a form of The Hunt. However, that doesn't explain how she managed to bring the Stellaron into the Scalegorge Waterscape, which was guarded by the Vidyadhara.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Well, you should ask Dan Shu herself for the answer.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Unfortunately, Dan Shu is dead, and even her corpse has crumbled into ash. That's one less clue we can pursue.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: The exile of Imbibitor Lunae is what led to this calamity.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : If the Luofu hadn't exiled Dan Heng, leaving the Vidyadhara with no leader, they wouldn't have fallen into chaos, and there wouldn't have been the opportunity to bring the Stellaron to the Roots of the Arbor unnoticed.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Imbibitor Lunae was exiled due to his own crimes. Now, Dan Heng, as his reincarnation, is free from his sins. However, why did he risk trespassing on the Xianzhou Luofu before his exile was lifted?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: I was concerned about the safety of my companions, so I acted brazenly. I admit I was reckless at that time, but...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: But you returned despite everything. Now let's consider the outcome: The Arbor was resurrected, and the Luofu required a high elder to repair the seal and suppress the plaguemark. It's hard not to think about the stakes involved, right?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Refuse to answer anything.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : I don't believe we are in a position to answer this question. We Nameless came here to resolve the Stellaron crisis, and we cannot be expected to know the details of Dan Shu's conspiracy.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: You make a valid point. That's how innocent people should react. Let's skip this question for now.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: According to the report, Lord Ravager Phantylia is the mastermind behind the entire conspiracy.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: She disguised herself as an amicassador of the Sky-Faring Commission and traveled with you, only to vanish without a trace later on. It seems too convenient to label her as a scapegoat.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Fu Xuan, the Master Diviner, witnessed everything firsthand.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Back then, we were working with Diviner Fu, and she also witnessed Phantylia's true form. You're not going to doubt one of your own people, are you?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Of course not, we can trust the testimony of Master Diviner Fu Xuan. However... even if she saw it with her own eyes, we can't completely rule out the possibility that she might have been deceived. After all, it's suspicious how the culprit just bizarrely vanished.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Phantylia is a heliobus.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Phantylia is one of the heliobi, the energy lifeforms that once fought against the Xianzhou. They're known for their unpredictable and elusive nature.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: Just as  said, when the Ambrosial Arbor resurrected, its roots broke through the Creation Furnace on the Luofu, accidentally releasing the heliobus fiendfire sealed inside. This can be used as circumstantial evidence.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: If Elder Huaiyan accepts the explanation, so do I.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Phantylia was eager to obtain the power of Ambrosial Arbor [sic].
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : I was there, fighting Phantylia alongside General Jing Yuan, but she absorbed the power of the Ambrosial Arbor and gained an almost indestructible physical form. Perhaps that was her intention all along.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: So, a pawn of the Destruction wanted a flesh-and-blood body to live in? Hmm, interesting. That's quite a new perspective.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Refuse to answer anything.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : I'm not sure how to answer that question.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: The Lord Ravager is a master at manipulating situations and sowing discord among her enemies. General Feixiao, given your suspicions of the internal affairs on the Luofu, I wouldn't be surprised if...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: So, I'm not even allowed to ask questions? Asking questions is considered sowing discord now? Well, that's convenient for you, just like Phantylia vanishing without a trace.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Well, it appears that you are still unable to give explanations for several details about how the Nameless got involved in the Ambrosial Arbor crisis.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Well, it seems that your answers have addressed all my questions.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Generals, I am finished with my questioning.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: So, what do you think, General Feixiao? Have the doubts in the report been cleared up?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: The two Nameless have been honest in their answers. Even though there are some tricky details, my intuition tells me there is nothing wrong.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: However, the three questions I posed earlier were not just for the Nameless, but for you too, General Jing Yuan.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: First, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus grew uninterrupted on the Luofu, yet the Six Charioteers were not aware of it. That was a dereliction of duty.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Second, you believed in the Stellaron Hunters' prophecy and entrusted outsiders to solve the crisis, even granting them access to the plaguemark. That was a dereliction of responsibility.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Third, you insist on holding the Wardance right after the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, putting the Luofu back in the spotlight. That is a dereliction of wisdom.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: Merlin's Claw, is this your line of thinking... or the Ten Lords'?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: From the moment I walked in, I made it clear that the questions I'd ask might not reflect my actual thoughts.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: ...The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were deeply rooted and had been plotting for a long time. I admit it was my negligence for not noticing it earlier.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: As for the Stellaron Hunters' prophecy, I didn't believe all of it, but in the end, the Luofu did survive the Ambrosial Arbor crisis. So, I think it's safe to say that Elio's prophecy about the future holds some merit.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: And as for the Wardance... Do you think I'm unaware of the risks? However, risks can also be opportunities. The Luofu has lain low for too long. I believe it's time to stir up the dregs hidden in the depths and wash them away once and for all.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Just as I expected from our sophisticated Divine Foresight. You have a way with words. I like it.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: But unfortunately, ever since the report was submitted, the Alliance has been filled with rumors and speculation. Even within the Luofu, there are people accusing you of neglecting your duties, resulting in the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: So, what are your thoughts on all of this, General Feixiao?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: As a fellow Arbiter-General, I fully understand the difficulties of this position.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Personally, I think all these rumors are meaningless drivel. Across the sea of stars, the Divine Foresight knows better than anyone else what happened on the Luofu and the meaning behind it...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: ...Just as what happened on the Xianzhou Yaoqing recently.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: You mean, the Xianzhou Yaoqing is also...?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: The scouts of the Verdant Knights have sent back reports that borisin are making trouble again. The borisin packs that were once divided and scattered have started swallowing each other up, forming larger and larger packs. Moreover, there's an entity named "Mangas" behind it all.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: An "entity"?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: According to the report, this entity... isn't actually a borisin. It's a woman claiming to be the Messenger of the Master of Immortality. She's described as having "twelve faces and twelve pairs of fangs, as cruel as poison and as elusive as quicksand." The borisin believe she'll give them a chance to rise again.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: That's Phantylia.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: That's right.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: You're lucky that I'm the one who came this time. If it were the Patina Justice or the Seer Strategist, this conversation might not be so friendly.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: I've always had faith in my instincts, so I don't doubt your good intentions. But the Alliance has its fair share of questions and doubts about the Luofu. So, my plan is to come up with an acceptable answer to satisfy the Alliance.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: What's in this plan, General Feixiao?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: General Jing Yuan, you already know what has to be done, but since you don't want to be the bad guy, I'll take care of it for you. You need the final word from the Ten-Lords Commission to quell any doubts.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: And for that, I'll have to ask the two Nameless to visit the Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Are you imprisoning us?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: No, I'm not imprisoning you. While you're there, I'll ask a judge in the Ten-Lords Commission's Interrogation Division to record a detailed testimony with the Karmic Mirror from both of you. We'll fill in the gaps that weren't covered in the report and silence any protests within the Alliance.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: ...I'm okay with that.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Me too.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: Your willingness to help is truly heartwarming, youngsters.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: I object!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Worried that I might go back on my word and keep you in The Shackling Prison? Relax, if I wanted to do that, you'd already be behind bars. Once you're done with your testimony, you're free to come and go as you please.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Will you let us come back...?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Worried that I might go back on my word and keep you in The Shackling Prison? Relax, if I wanted to do that, you'd already be behind bars. Once you're done with your testimony, you're free to come and go as you please.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: Then, as the Merlin's Claw requests...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Oh, there's one more thing. This testimony is for silencing the voices of opposition within the Alliance, but I would like to urge General Jing Yuan to listen to the pleas of the foxians on the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: So, you are here for Hoolay?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Exactly. Hoolay is locked up in the Luofu's Shackling Prison. Since he is the Brood Lord of the borisin, I want to transfer him onto the Xianzhou Yaoqing and imprison him there. The recent movements of the borisin suggest they're planning something big, so we must act preemptively.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: It makes sense to have the foxians keep an eye on their arch-nemesis. Since you trust my judgment, I'll repay that trust. What do you think about all this, General Huaiyan?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: I was worried this would turn into a heated argument, but it seems like both of you are on the same page, solving each other's problems! I couldn't have asked for a better outcome!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: And as for Hoolay, I'll send my lieutenants Jiaoqiu and Moze to check on his condition in prison and ready him for transport. If there are no more questions, shall we get this started?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Huaiyan]: Well, I'm glad we managed to talk this out.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Feixiao give you a once-over, and despite lacking any apparent reason, you feel scrutinized, as if she were sizing up an opponent.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: Do you actually believe in the Stellaron Hunters' prophecy?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: I do.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Yes, I do. That's why I'm here.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: No, I don't.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : No, I don't. That's why I'm here, to prove that the prophecy is not real.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: I don't know.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : The Xianzhou's Matrix of Prescience can also predict the future... Do you believe in its prophecies?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: ...I understand.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Do you really believe us?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Feixiao gives a nod.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: While words can be deceiving, your gaze, your breathing, and your scent... they reveal more than your words do.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: I trust my intuition more than any words.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: What are you looking at?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: You're definitely a unique individual, just like Huaiyan said.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: I hope you'll walk alongside the Reignbow's path as a friend.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: You're definitely a unique individual, just like Huaiyan said.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Feixiao]: I hope you'll walk alongside the Reignbow's path as a friend.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: I'm really sorry about all this, , but the testimony in the Shackling Prison won't take up much of your time.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jing Yuan]: I'll call for a messenger to take you to the Interrogation Division. You just need to give your testimony and then you can head back. So, no need to worry.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: As you wish, General.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Let's get going.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Maybe just one moment?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Some time later, a starskiff carries you and Dan Heng to a place that looks strikingly familiar...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: As General Jing Yuan requested, everything is prepared for your arrival, and I am here to receive you. The judges at the Interrogation Division also know your purpose in coming.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: If both of you are ready, please follow me to The Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: The Shackling Prison... I didn't expect to be back here after all these years.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Dan Heng...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Don't worry about me.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: If you're ready, I'll open the gate for you.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: This is the entrance to The Shackling Prison?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: This is one of many entrances used for temporary access. Since you're not actual prisoners, it makes sense for you to use this entrance. Please come on in, dear guests.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: We're ready to go in.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Just one moment, please.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Wait, is The Shackling Prison inside the Scalegorge Waterscape, too?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: Well, technically, The Shackling Prison is spread out across multiple delves, and the ancient sea is just where they overlap. Please come on in, dear guests.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: We're ready to go in.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Just one moment, please.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Once I step through that door, I'll be inside the prison?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: Exactly. Please come on in, dear guests.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: We're ready to go in.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Just one moment, please.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: If you're ready, I'll open the gate for you.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: We're ready to go in.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Just one moment, please.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Moze]: What are you looking at?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: The Shackling Prison on the Luofu... is completely different from the one on the Yaoqing. It's completely underwater.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Moze]: Whether it's in the clouds or underwater, breaking free would still be a piece of cake for me.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: You're still thinking about your old jailbreak tricks, huh? Forget it. You're free now. Just don't do anything stupid, or the judges will throw you back in there and lock you up for a few hundred years.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Moze]: You'll see me again in just a few days.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Taking Hoolay back to the Yaoqing means a lot to the foxians on the ship and to the General herself. So, stay alert.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Guests, my name is Xueyi, and I'm here on orders from the Incarceration Division of the Ten-Lords Commission.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: We're Jiaoqiu and Moze. General Feixiao sent us to extradite the borisin criminal Hoolay to the Yaoqing.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: We're here to inspect the conditions of his imprisonment and make preparations for the handover and transportation. I assume you've been briefed, your honor.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Your visit request has been approved. I'll be your guide for this trip.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Prisoner Hoolay, the Warhead and Brood Lord of the borisin Abominations of Abundance and the arch-nemesis of the foxians, is responsible for 2,123 wars of aggression and countless associated crimes.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Due to his heinous acts, he has been imprisoned in the depths of The Shackling Prison and subjected to the punishment of the Forest of Swords until the end of time. He shall never be pardoned...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: No need to repeat his crimes and sentence, your honor. He is the greatest enemy of us foxians. The stories of his atrocities are used to terrify our children. I'm well aware of every crime he's committed. Let's move on to the next step.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: When it comes to visiting criminals, there are rules in place to ensure your safety.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: I know you've heard legends about Hoolay since you were children, but your knowledge about him is likely very limited. Only the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission truly know what kind of abomination is locked up at the bottom of The Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: It has been centuries since Jingliu, the former Sword Champion of the Luofu, captured Hoolay. And during all those years, we never provided him with any food. Yet he's somehow managed to stay alive. It defies all the documented physical characteristics of the borisin.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: The Forest of Swords, forged by the Punishment Division, is a device of intense torment used to execute sinful abominations. Most borisin die within three days in the Forest, but Hoolay is different. Every time the blades pierce him, his body instantly heals. Despite the brutal punishment, he somehow manages to survive.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: The complex rules are there because of his abnormal characteristics. Do you understand now?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: I apologize for any offense caused... Please continue, your honor.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: I've given you the instructions regarding Hoolay's visitation. Please make sure you read them carefully.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Reminders When Visiting Hoolay
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Prisoner]: HoolaySummary of Crimes:The borisin Warhead, a Denizen of Abundance. Accountable for numerous acts of invasions and associated war crimes. Accountable for the long-term enslavement of foxians and utilizing their blood for alchemical purposes.Detention Method:This prisoner must be subjected to the punishment of the Forest of Swords and never be pardoned. They must be transferred to different locations on a regular basis, their shackles must be checked for sturdiness during the transfer, and the air filters in their new cell must be intact and functional.Notes:1. The confinement of this prisoner is the foundation of the alliance between the Xianzhou and the foxians. Any individuals objecting to this sentence should be punished for "Sowing Discord."2. Anyone who contacts or converses with this prisoner must take poison-proof pellets or wear a breathing mask equipped with a filter cartridge to counteract the effects of Lupitoxin.3. The prisoner's place of detention must be changed on a yearly basis, and the new location must remain unknown to individuals below the rank of Cloud Knight Lieutenant or Judge.4. Do not mention "Jingliu" when conversing with this prisoner.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: And please take this pellet before proceeding.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Moze]: No, I'm not taking random medicine.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Then you won't be allowed to visit Hoolay.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Just swallow it already. Hoolay is like all borisin, he can release a pheromone called Lupitoxin that induces fear.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Thousands of years ago, we foxians were enslaved by the borisin, not because we were naturally weaker, but because of their Lupitoxin. This pill is for our own mental well-being.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Moze]: I understand.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: I knew you were a reasonable person. Now that we've taken the medicine, let's proceed.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Your honor...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: What is it?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: No, never mind, maybe I'm just imagining things... Let's keep moving.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: Here we are.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: Her Honor hasn't arrived yet. Please wait a moment.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Messenger]: Her Honor hasn't arrived yet. Please wait a moment.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: This place... it's still as cold as it used to be.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Are you okay, Dan Heng?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Sorry, I was just reminiscing about some unpleasant memories.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Once we're done with the testimony, we'll leave immediately.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Even if you can't escape your past, we're always here for you.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Thank you, . It's all my fault that you were involved in the Xianzhou's problems. You shouldn't have to see the inside of The Shackling Prison... I'm so sorry.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: I wish I could show you the real sights of the Luofu.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Dan Heng gently pats your hand.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Why can't they record our testimony outside The Shackling Prison?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: The Six Charioteers might have more power over the rest of this Xianzhou ship, but here, in The Shackling Prison, it's the judges of the Ten-Lords Commission who call the shots.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: The judges will use a complicated interrogation device called the Karmic Mirror. It accurately tracks every physiological change during questioning and records it.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Therefore, the judgment made here will be sufficient to convince the other administrators of the Xianzhou... At least they won't attempt to challenge the conclusions. Perhaps that's why Feixiao insisted that we come here.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Since the judge isn't here yet, I'll just wander around a bit.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Okay, but watch your step. This place is not like the others.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Welcome, dear guests from the Express. Judge Hanya of the Interrogation Division, we've met before.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Miss Hanya?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Glad to meet you again, .
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: It's you?!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: As one of the judges from the Interrogation Division, I'll be recording your testimony today.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Are you and your sister the only judges here?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Hmm? You don't want to see me, ? Well, in that case, I can call in the judge who's an expert in acupuncture, or the one who's handy with axes and saws, or the one who knows all about whips and ropes... We've got plenty of options here, and we'll find one that suits your taste.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Just kidding. We judges work in shifts, and it just happens to be my shift, . Maybe we're destined to cross paths.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Please allow me to express my gratitude to you again for subduing the demons in the Fyxestroll Garden.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Looks like while March 7th and I were clueless, you already made many friends on the Xianzhou Luofu.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: It was all a lucky coincidence.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Pom-Pom takes care of us at home, and friends take care of us on the road. That's just how it goes.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Even though  and I have met before, we can't show any favoritism under the Ten Lords. So, please do as I command as we head to Scrivener Hall and beyond. Don't do anything without my permission.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: This is not a place for ordinary mortals.  and Mr. Dan Heng, please come with me.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Please lead the way, your honor.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Please let me activate the mechanism before we all move forward, and please watch your steps.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Be very careful and watch your step as you make your way through.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: The terrain inside the Shackling Prison is treacherous. One wrong move, and you could end up plunging into the depths. And if you're really unlucky, you might be frozen solid or burned to a crisp before anyone can help you.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : Gee...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: But with your skills, I don't think you need to worry about that.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: So, are there really eighteen floors here?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: You're funny, . This prison does contain many layers. We even brought in Vidyadhara Ichor Line craftsmen to introduce the ingenuity of delve enchantment. What you're seeing now is just one part of The Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Is that true, Dan Heng?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Perhaps. Judging from the appearance, much of the architecture in this prison has a Vidyadharan style... So perhaps they did have a hand in building this place back then.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: As for how many floors there are...? Well, not even us judges know for sure.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: But there's a legend among us judges that a short-life prisoner once tried to escape but ended up falling into the depths... and when we found him at the bottom, he was already an old man on the brink of death...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Did he spend his whole life falling? Or did some long-life prisoner drain his life essence? We'll never know. Anyway, please don't try anything like that.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Why keep the terrain so dangerous?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: You're funny, . This prison does contain many layers. We even brought in Vidyadhara Ichor Line craftsmen to introduce the ingenuity of delve enchantment. What you're seeing now is just one part of The Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Is that true, Dan Heng?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Perhaps. Judging from the appearance, much of the architecture in this prison has a Vidyadharan style... So perhaps they did have a hand in building this place back then.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Well, the paths here serve as both passageways for the Ten-Lords Commission and barriers for the prisoners.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Most prisoners locked up here have committed serious crimes violating the Xianzhou Legal Code, and many of them are Denizens of Abundance like borisin, houyhnhnm, and wingweavers. To be honest, these abominations... are pretty good at trying to break out.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: So, as long as the treacherous terrain here makes it harder for them to escape, the Ten-Lords Commission doesn't have any complaints.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Please come this way.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: I heard the Wardance is about to be held in the mortal world. I remember watching a sword duel at the Wardance with my sister when we were young.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: The Cloud Knight who was the Luofu's ringmaster was an amazing swordsman, and their sword flashed like lightning. The outworld challenger had fiery red hair and a hand made of steel which roared like thunder. They battled for a long time before a winner could be declared.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Time sure flies. Now, both my sister and I are residents of the netherworld, and we will never again feel the thrill of a competition.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Are there a lot of people in Starskiff Haven due to the Wardance, ?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Yeah, it's bustling.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Sounds amazing. It's a shame I'm too busy to attend... but even if I could, I'd probably just scare people off with my current appearance.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Aren't we going to take the elevator?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Sorry, I got a bit distracted there.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Let's get going, then.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: : ...It's freezing.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: This place is filled with the cold air from the Northern Peak of the Polar Delve.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Even the toughest long-life species would have a hard time enduring this.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Hmm? Did you hear something just now?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Let me check it out.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Ugh, what an eyesore. This place is packed with boxes and crates.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: These crates... they look oddly familiar.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: A few days ago, the spiritfarers received reports about an IPC transport ship that was attacked by borisin. Then, a bunch of those abominations were dumped into this place.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: I had a feeling there would be trouble during the Wardance. But throwing both the pirates and the cargo in jail? That's a new one.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: The mechs in those crates are no joke.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Looks like the IPC has caught the attention of the borisin...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: I heard the Intelligentsia Guild crafted something dangerous. We have many records in the Hall of Karma about these wise ones. They love to tinker with forbidden technologies, always trying to push the limits of ingenia.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: I caught a glimpse of the mechs in those crates, and they bear a striking resemblance to borisin. I wonder what they're planning this time?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Well, business first. Let's keep moving.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Strange...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: I don't remember checking the containment facilities the second time...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Watch out!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Emergency! All wardens prepare for action!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Emergency! All wardens prepare for action!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: What's happening here? Why are these things moving on their own?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Something is wrong. The guards aren't responding...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: This thing... is going wild, just like a borisin.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: Looks like we're on our own for this one.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: But how is this even possible? The spiritfarers followed the protocols, cutting off power to the mechs and sealing the crates. How could these mechs still start moving?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: It's just like what happened in the Artisanship Commission before. These goods went haywire and attacked everyone in sight.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Lingsha mentioned there was some kind of biological tissue inside the mechs.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: The Alchemy Commission members examined them and found some unusual structures within.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Where are the spiritfarers? Why hasn't anyone come to help us?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: Something seems to be jamming communications within The Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: It's probably these mechs causing the trouble.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: These things showing up in The Shackling Prison can only mean one thing...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: A prison break.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Dan Heng]: And whoever delivered these "goods" clearly wanted them to go through the Xianzhou's strict inspection process, to show the Sky-Faring Commission and Cloud Knights how dangerous they were. They wanted these mechs to end up right here in The Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: If these things already started taking action while nobody was paying attention, then the whole prison is in trouble, I'm afraid.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: And to make things worse, another group of visitors just entered the depths of The Shackling Prison, the messengers from the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hanya]: And the prisoner they came to visit... might be the target whom these wolf-shaped mechs were delivered here for. If that vicious beast manages to break free... it will be a catastrophe for the Xianzhou Luofu!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Switching to Jiaoqiu's POV...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Dispatched by the general of the Yaoqing, Jiaoqiu and Moze enter The Shackling Prison to visit Hoolay, the borisin Warhead imprisoned there...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: A few moments prior, Xueyi leads the Yaoqing messengers to the bottom of the prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Here we are.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Have we arrived already, your honor?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Shouldn't there be a cage here?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: The most notorious felons are locked away in solitary delves deep down in the prison. Those delves can't be opened without proper authorization.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: "The blue bird paves the path, and the Stygian Lanterns illuminate it." Help me light up these lanterns, and the way to the bottom of the Shackling Prison will reveal itself.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: I've given you the diagrams for lighting the lanterns. Please take a look.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Guidance for Stygian Lantern
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: The markings on the stone indicate the order in which the Stygian Lanterns need to be lit from the bottom to the top.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Awaken the Messenger
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Visiting the Shackling Prison's crypts. Authorization complete.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: The path is open. Once we descend to the bottom of the prison, please do not do anything reckless.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Inside the delve behind this door is the greatest enemy of the foxians, Hoolay.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Voice From Behind the Door]: Arrrrgh...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: According to custom, envoys from the Yaoqing visit the Xianzhou Luofu once every century to check on this abomination's imprisonment and condition.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Even though the Ten-Lords Commission sentenced Hoolay to the Forest of Swords, suffering every day for the rest of his life, I understand that the Yaoqing messengers want to see him dead...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Unfortunately, for the past seven centuries, they've had to return disappointed, because this beast simply can't be killed.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: If we can use his toxin to create medicine and save an innocent life, it might help balance out some of the sins he has committed.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Could you be the key to a cure for the General, Hoolay?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][???]: And once again, the envoys of the Yaoqing will leave disappointed. However, I won't say the same for me and my brothers...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Who's there?!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][???]: I'm just a humble counselor of the Rhinohound Pack. You can call me... Mok Tok
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Wardens! Intruders on the lowest level! Send reinforcements!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Nobody will hear you here, at the bottom of the Shackling Prison.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Thank you for opening up the prison for us, your honor. We'll take it from here.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: No wonder I kept smelling that familiar stench. So, it wasn't just my imagination. Do your thing, Moze!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: We mustn't let these abominations get any closer!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Detestable things, there are too many of them.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Once we were inside The Shackling Prison, we found "soldiers" available for us everywhere.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: I suggest you surrender now.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Of course, I'll still kill you all.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: ...But I promise it'll be swift.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: How presumptuous! Die now!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Leave if you can, Moze.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Moze]: ...It's not time yet.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Xueyi]: Guard the gate — they can't be allowed in!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: Hurry!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: I've waited... for too long...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: My first meal after regaining my freedom... Is the flesh and blood of my fellow kindred. A sad scene indeed.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: It's been a long time, Warhead. Welcome back.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: How many times has the old verdant home spun around since our last hunt? Ah, Duran's whelp! Tell me your name!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: O, Great Hoolay, nemesis of the foxians, and the hunter of all beings, I'm Mok Tok, a humble counselor of the Rhinohound Pack. I am only one insignificant heir spawned from your bloodline.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: It's been... at least seven centuries since you led our Pack through the hunting grounds of the stars. I'm thrilled to see that you are as cunning and skillful as ever.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: Seven centuries... Seven centuries have passed, but why have Duran's whelps grown to look like this? Tell me, Mok Tok, why have you grown to resemble our most despicable slaves and enemies, the foxians?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: I've been commanded to release you from this cursed prison. It is Sain Jiyaa's will. That's why I had to take a magic pill, don the skin of a lowly beast, and play along with their hypocrisy.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: Since you have an escape plan, tell me, what's our next move to get off of this ridiculously large ship?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: My brothers and I will lock down this prison, trapping the prison guards inside. This will buy us some time.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: The rest of my crew, who are undercover like me, will secure the vessels for our escape. According to the plan, we only have a tight two-hour window to get out of here.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Originally, I intended to carry out the plan tomorrow, but they're planning to transfer you to the Xianzhou Yaoqing now, so I seized this opportunity to set you free.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: What a reckless plan, you idiot! Even if we manage to get the ships, our chances of escaping are slimmer than a foxian slipping through my claws!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: But we have no other choice! The angel serving under the Master of Immortality sent me with a message, "Only your return will end the prolonged divisions among the borisin."
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Every one of my crew is ready to lay down their lives if it means setting you free.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: A sneaky weakling like you is actually showing some reckless bravery with this plan. Fine, you'll get what you want... and all of Duran's whelps will too.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: Well then, my Lord, we should leave now.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: Before we go, give me one of those magic pills.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: My Lord... you seriously want to don the skin of a lowly beast? That would be a disgrace to your greatness, my Lord...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: You idiot! Greatness means nothing without freedom! Once I get out, I'll need a disguise that won't raise any suspicion.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: As you wish, my Lord.
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Hoolay]: Is that foxian slave my meal?
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Mok Tok]: No, he's an envoy from the Xianzhou Yaoqing. I plead you to endure him a bit, my Lord, as he's more valuable as a hostage. Take him, guys! Time to move out!
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Inquisition to Rectitude][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: At the same time, , Dan Heng, and Hanya realize that the situation in the prison is out of control...
[Rogues on the Run][Wraith Warden]: Madam Hanya, the wardens in all areas are regrouping. Those ingenium enemies are wandering around and causing heavy casualties.
[Rogues on the Run][Wraith Warden]: And to make things worse, those iron wolves broke open the cages and let the criminals out! We've called for backup, but it seems like all communication is jammed.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Let's preserve our strength and first take down the isolated prisoners. By decree of the Ten Lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
[Rogues on the Run][Aurumaton Spectral Envoy]: Just a short time ago, the Nether Key mechanism was activated. It was probably Madam Xueyi and the Yaoqing messengers, heading to the bottom of the prison. Given the situation, I'm afraid that area is exactly where our enemies are targeting.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: We mustn't let that vile beast escape from its cage!
[Rogues on the Run][Aurumaton Spectral Envoy]: We've gathered all the prison guards who can still fight, and we'll split up and secure each floor.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Go!
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Those intruders are quite bold. They must have been planning this for quite a while.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Indeed, but borisin tend to favor direct and aggressive approaches. Crafting careful and precise plans like this... is simply not their style.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Let's focus on the current situation right now. Please help me!
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Looks like the testimony will have to wait, huh?
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Like I said, wherever we go, we always end up in trouble.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: What's the fastest way to the bottom of this prison, Miss Hanya? If we don't get there quickly, we'll soon be outnumbered by all the enemies inside.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: We'll have to bend the rules. Please follow me.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: By decree of the Ten Lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
[Rogues on the Run][Warden]: Yes, ma'am!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Hold your position here.
[Rogues on the Run][Aurumaton Spectral Envoy]: Yes, ma'am!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: We need a few tools if we want to reach the bottom quickly.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Follow me to the next floor.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: The path is cut off? Someone must have altered the mechanism.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: No matter, it'll just require a bit more work to get through.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Some spiritfarers occasionally use ingenia from the Artisanship Commission to navigate the treacherous terrain here.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Normally, using devices like the shifting screen is strictly forbidden, as they could help prisoners escape.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: But given the urgency of the situation, let's just ignore the usual regulations.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: The Nether Key has been activated. I hope we're not too late...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Hang in there, sister!
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Looks like there was a fierce battle here not long ago.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: ...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: The gate to the prison delve is wide open. Hoolay has managed to break free.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Where are the Yaoqing messengers, and where's my sister? Are they still alive?
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Let's look around. Maybe we'll find some clues.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: : Xueyi... is here.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Miss Xueyi bravely sacrificed herself... My condolences, Miss Hanya.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Condolences? Well, that's unnecessary.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: You misunderstand. Thanks to the Ten Lords' blessing, my sister turned into an ingenium centuries ago. Dying and returning as just a soul to the Hall of Karma's document office has become a routine for her.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: While I'm not keen on seeing her throw away her body like it's some replaceable part, but...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: By the way, have you seen bodies that might be the Yaoqing messengers? One of them is a foxian wearing exquisite clothes, and the other wears a dark cloak, like a fugitive.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: ...No, I haven't found any foxian bodies, only borisin ones.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: So, the intruders and Hoolay are holding the Yaoqing messengers hostage.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: This is the worst situation. With hostages in their grasp, the prison guards can't do anything about the prisoners. If anything happens to the messengers, the relationship between the Yaoqing and the Luofu... could be irreversibly damaged.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: We must rescue the messengers, get out of here, and spread the news. We mustn't give up as long as there's a glimmer of hope!
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: What have you found, Miss Hanya?
[Rogues on the Run][Broken Cycrane]: Han... Han...
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: What the heck?!
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: A cyber specter!
[Rogues on the Run][Broken Cycrane]: Re... Reconstru...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: It's my sister. Looks like her soul hasn't returned to the Hall of Karma yet.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: At such a critical moment... her "death" can give us information that we can turn into an advantage.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Let me see. The damage isn't too bad.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: If I can fix it up, my sister will have a temporary body.
[Rogues on the Run][Repaired Cycrane]: Hanya! I-I-I'm back!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Welcome back, sister. I don't know what kind of expression I should have at a time like this. Happy? Tears of joy? Ah, forget it. I'm used to you coming back in all sorts of forms.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: A cyber specter!
[Rogues on the Run][Xueyi]: It's just a t-t-temporary solution.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: That's pretty convenient!
[Rogues on the Run][Xueyi]: Just don't let me be d-d-damaged again... I'll lose my m-m-memories.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Your new form is kind of cute...
[Rogues on the Run][Xueyi]: Now is not the time for j-j-jokes!
[Rogues on the Run][Xueyi]: This cycrane can't... h-h-hold all of me...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Sister, what did you see when you were "killed"?
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Though intermittent in its delivery, the cycrane provides you with succinct and essential intelligence.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: One of the Yaoqing messengers escaped? And the other one was taken hostage and brought upwards?
[Rogues on the Run][Xueyi]: Besides the borisin... there were... other... intruders... Invisible...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Invisible intruders? What does that even mean? How many conspiracies are tangled up in this mess?
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Do me a favor, sister. The intruders have cut off all communication between inside and outside the prison, and now you're the only person... the only bird... who can slip out undetected.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Make sure you deliver the news to the outside world.
[Rogues on the Run][Xueyi]: I... understand. Please be careful... sister. You... are different... from me...
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: The cycrane flaps its wings and unsteadily flies out of the lower levels of the Shackling Prison, charging straight into the depths of the shadowy passage
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Time is running out, Miss Hanya. If we keep delaying, those borisin will escape from the prison.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Alright. If we happen to come across that Yaoqing messenger who got away...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: No, stopping Hoolay should probably be our top priority.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Wait, something feels off. Something is approaching us.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: The invisible intruders?
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Watch your back!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: These abominations aren't prisoners from this prison...
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: The prison management on the Luofu is truly concerning...
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Who are you?
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Aren't you looking for me?
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Just focus on the fight.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: The man seems to materialize from the shadowy corners of the prison, as if he could vanish into thin air at any moment.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: The "fugitive wearing a dark cloak," spoken of by Hanya, now stands before you. His face is devoid of any expression, cold and indifferent, yet... inexplicably, you could decipher this expressionless facade as if it whispered, "You're finally here."
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: The prison management on the Luofu is truly concerning...
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: You already said that a moment ago.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: So what if I repeat it? It's the truth after all. The prison management on the Luofu is truly concerning...
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: You look better when you're silent.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: ...
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Is that so?
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Hey, you're the Yaoqing messenger who fled!
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: I prefer to be called "the Yaoqing messenger who strategically retreated."
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: At least two different groups of intruders infiltrated here — the wolf cubs and these Mara-Struck Soldiers.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Their hiding technique... it's pretty similar to the Wind Mantle technique used by the Vidyadhara serving Caelorum Venti on the Yaoqing. What do you think?
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: ...
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Well, never mind if you don't have any clues. Now is not the time to exchange assassination techniques.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: I'm Moze. My friend fell into the clutches of that wolf. I was planning to escape and report back as quickly as possible, but now it seems...
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: The prison on the Luofu is a real maze, I must admit.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Thank you for your help, Mr. Moze. We'll do our best to ensure your friend's safety.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: No, you can do nothing for him now, and you shouldn't be focusing on his safety at the moment.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: You're so heartless!
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: But isn't he your friend?
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Your friend is in Hoolay's clutches, and you're just going to leave him behind?
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Look, I'm the Yaoqing General's guard, not his. I've seen how that giant wolf fights, and there is no way. Trying to save my friend will only get us killed.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: ...
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: I don't know how you think, but I won't throw my life away for a lost cause.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Listen up, I've been tracking these fugitives, and I know their next move. They're planning to seal off the entire prison to keep the outside world in the dark.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: The worst-case scenario, we are all killed by that giant wolf, and the Shackling Prison is sealed off. No one will know about us or about their escape until it's too late.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: And the best-case scenario...
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: We kick all those bad guys' butts!
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: With an indifferent gaze, he sized you up and down. Somehow, you deciphered his expressionless face as saying, "This person's lost their mind, how pitiful."
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: We trap them inside this prison.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: No, we won't be able to. We're one step behind them.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Both we and the intruders get trapped inside this prison.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Ah, looks like we've got some clever minds here after all.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: The best-case scenario would be, we seal the gates and trap the enemy inside with us. We can't let that monstrous wolf escape.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: Hopefully, someone will eventually notice that something is off and come to help. As for whether we'll still be alive by then, it's not something we should think about.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: You sure have a way of comforting people, Mr. Moze.
[Rogues on the Run][Moze]: As a person of the Yaoqing, I've always searched for something meaningful to give my life to.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: I have to make it out alive. My companions are waiting for me.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: As a netherworld dweller, I've already died once.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Well, then I'll give it my all.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Yeah, we won't give up, not until the very last moment.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: I want to make it out alive, too.
[Rogues on the Run][Dan Heng]: Don't worry. Even if we end up dying here, I won't let it happen to you first.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Well, you're just as good at comforting people as Mr. Moze.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Are we really out of options?
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: None of you are part of the Ten-Lords Commission, so sacrificing yourselves isn't the right move. As a judge, it's my responsibility to guard this prison, and if someone should step up to stop Hoolay from escaping, it should be me, not you.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Once we reach the gate, I hope you'll help me seal it. After that, I'll do everything I can to fight the borisin, and you find a safe place to hide and wait for reinforcements.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: Now, let's proceed upward!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: We must seal the entrance before the borisin fugitives get out.
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: The Prison Wardens and mechanisms won't be able to hold them for long. Follow me!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: The situation is critical. We cannot delay any longer!
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: We're almost there! The gate is just ahead!
[Rogues on the Run][Wraith Warden]: There are many fugitives. Please be careful, Your Honor.
[Rogues on the Run][Aurumaton Spectral Envoy]: The fugitives are charging at the gate. Please be careful, Your Honor.
[Rogues on the Run][Borisin Wolftrooper]: 
[Rogues on the Run][Hanya]: I will hold them back. Don't let Hoolay escape!
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: The Shackling Prison has become a killing field. The prison guards try to resist, but Jiaoqiu can only watch them fall...
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: A-Rraaa...
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: This brings back such... familiar memories! Memories of chasing, gnawing, and tearing... They're back, they're back! They've all come back!
[Rogues on the Run][Mok Tok]: My Lord, we're just one step away from freedom. Once we pass through the gate, no one will be able to stop us.
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: So, this hostage is useless now? Kill him, Mok Tok.
[Rogues on the Run][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Rogues on the Run][Mok Tok]: Maybe this Yaoqing messenger can strike a deal in exchange for his life. He can use his status to help us escape from the Xianzhou. What do you think, Mr. Jiaoqiu?
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: Just look at you! Fallen so low during my absence! You're even negotiating with livestock? As far as I recall, no one from the Yaoqing would ever consider a deal with Duran's offspring.
[Rogues on the Run][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Rogues on the Run][Jiaoqiu]: Deal. I certainly have more value alive...
[Rogues on the Run][Jiaoqiu]: My identity, my knowledge of the Xianzhou, and my understanding of many things that your minions have no knowledge of... They'll all be valuable.
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: Lowly beast, muster up that pitiful tongue of yours and plead for what remains of your life. Speak up.
[Rogues on the Run][Jiaoqiu]: I'm afraid you're unaware, the woman who defeated you, Jingliu... She has recently returned to the Luofu.
[Rogues on the Run][Jiaoqiu]: Your opportunity for revenge is right in front of you.
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: ...
[Rogues on the Run][Mok Tok]: My Lord! This slave is talking nonsense. I've never heard anything about this! May I just kill him now?
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: Silence, Mok Tok! And you, slave... From now on, you'll stay by my side. You'll only speak and move when I allow you to. Otherwise, I'll dismember you, from head to tail, inch by inch. Got it?
[Rogues on the Run][Mok Tok]: But my Lord...
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: We must stay here for some time, Mok Tok. Fear not, because once I step out of the prison, it's the people of the Xianzhou who should tremble in fear. I'll show them what true calamity means.
[Rogues on the Run][Hoolay]: Now, Duran's whelps! Follow me!
[Rogues on the Run][Borisin Wolftrooper]: Prison guards, stop them! For our great lord Hoolay!
[Rogues on the Run][Borisin Wolftrooper]: 
[Rogues on the Run][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Report! After we lost contact with The Shackling Prison, we received a message from a cycrane...
[Rogues on the Run][Cloud Knight Soldier]: The prisoners have revolted, and the criminal Hoolay... is nowhere to be found!
[Rogues on the Run][Jing Yuan]: What about the Yaoqing messengers and the Nameless?
[Rogues on the Run][Cloud Knight Soldier]: No news at the moment! We're trying to restore contact with The Shackling Prison as soon as possible!
[Rogues on the Run][Feixiao]: I see. You're dismissed.
[Rogues on the Run][Feixiao]: General Jing Yuan, General Huaiyan, it's just as we suspected... the rise of the Ambrosial Arbor was not the end of things, but the beginning.
[Rogues on the Run][Feixiao]: The hand of the Ruin Legion has already sown the seeds of "Destruction." From this moment on, the Xianzhou Alliance will face an even greater challenge, from both the Abominations of Abundance and the "Destruction" itself.
[Rogues on the Run][Feixiao]: If this is what they want, I'm always up for a challenge!
[Rogues on the Run][Feixiao]: As the Marshal's special envoy, I'll dispatch the Luofu Cloud Knights to pursue Hoolay myself.
[Rogues on the Run][Jing Yuan]: Looks like the hidden dregs have finally come to the surface. And as I said before, it's time to wash them away, once and for all.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: After a brief but devastating loss of communications, the locked-down Shackling Prison is once more under control. The Express' Nameless may have emerged unharmed, but one of the Yaoqing envoys has been taken hostage.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: Meanwhile, the borisin Warhead Hoolay, long confined to the depth of Shackling Prison, has vanished without a trace.
[Rogues on the Run][Narration]: A pursuit between the hunter and the hunted will soon play out on the Xianzhou Luofu.

[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: After the Shackling Prison BreakOn the Starskiff Haven streets
[At Dawn, To War][Excited Outworlder Tourist]: Seriously, when is this Wardance going to start? The Skysplitter has been hovering there for ages. When can we board and see what's inside?
[At Dawn, To War][Expectant Outworlder Tourist]: Is this how long-life species live? Everything proceeds so slowly. The effectiveness of "anticipation" in my emotional center is at an all-time high. Oh, I need to drink some coolant.
[At Dawn, To War][Xianzhou Local Resident]: Relax, the Realm-Keeping Commission will send boarding notices to all ticket holders. The gazette said the Skysplitter will fire a salute before the ceremony starts!
[At Dawn, To War][Excited Outworlder Tourist]: I saw the schedule for the first day of the tournament. Can you believe the ringmaster accepted four challenges? And he's just a kid! So, who are you betting on, Bardeau?
[At Dawn, To War][Expectant Outworlder Tourist]: I'm betting on neither. I lost all my credits betting on Roboball games in Taikiyan. This time, I've decided not to rely on probability games to accomplish my target of "getting rich"...
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Wardance...
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: There you are, .
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: I heard you and Mr. Dan Heng went to meet the judges, and then a riot broke out in The Shackling Prison. I was so worried about you. Thank goodness, you both made it out safe.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Discuss what happened...
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: : There was a revolt in The Shackling Prison... Fortunately, we were protected by the guards until the Cloud Knights arrived to rescue us.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: What happened on your end?
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: I was planning to take Miss March and Yunli to Stargazer Navalia to see the Skysplitter up close, but we stumbled upon a group of suspicious foxians carrying official identities.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: They were acting strange, so out of curiosity, we decided to follow them. It turns out that they were actually borisin disguised as foxians!
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: It seems they infiltrated Stargazer Navalia in order to prepare for Hoolay's escape, and we foiled their plans by pure chance.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: I wonder who provided them with those disguises, and how many more borisin have taken advantage of the Wardance to infiltrate the ship?
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: What's your plan now?
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: The borisin traveled all the way here to infiltrate the Luofu and attempt to rescue their leader with a crafty scheme... This is completely unlike them. To be honest, it reminds me of what the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus did during the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: At present, all three generals are on guard and taking action to hunt down the fugitives and the mastermind behind it all, in order to prevent further trouble.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: However, if these borisin can disguise themselves as foxians... where do we even begin to search for them?
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Those tourists over there are talking about you...
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Yeah, I heard them, too, but I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint them. I've already reported to General Jing Yuan that I'll give up my role as the ringmaster.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: What? You're not going to defend the ring?
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: But haven't you been preparing for it for so long?
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: The security of the Luofu is more important to me than anything else. I need to fulfill my duties as a Cloud Knight Lieutenant before taking on the honor of being a ringmaster.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Those tourists just want to see some good sword fights. Anyone can participate in this kind of tournament. It doesn't have to be me.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: The real challenge lies beyond the ring on the Skysplitter. If we don't capture the fugitives soon, Hoolay will wreak havoc.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Obviously, there is someone behind the scenes orchestrating this prison break, intending to spread chaos. If we fail to thwart their evil plan, what honor will be left for us to uphold?
[At Dawn, To War][???]: Well said.
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: You may be tiny in stature, but your ambition matches that of the Yaoqing's warriors.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Hey, this has nothing to do with my height.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: What brings you here, General?
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: I thought all the generals were on the move already?
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Yes, I suggested to Yanqing that we find a place to have a decent meal. A hunter must be well-fed before "the hunt."
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: You still have a good appetite even in the face of disaster — you truly are the Merlin's Claw... Please, finish the food quickly so we can get to work, General Feixiao.
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Well, that's not up to me... Dig in. I called you here so you could enjoy the food.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Me? This isn't the time for a leisurely meal... and this is way too much for me!
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Oh? You'd give me time to enjoy a meal but not yourself?
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Ever since you encountered those borisin spies, you've been so busy that you've hardly eaten anything. You can't defeat Hoolay on an empty stomach.
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Take your time. Enjoy the meal and calm yourself.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: Hoolay's whereabouts are still unknown, and they've even taken Mr. Jiaoqiu hostage. The longer we wait, the more complicated the situation becomes.
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Jiaoqiu always said I'm the most impatient person among the Cloud Knights, and I can't argue with that. So there's no reason for you to be more anxious than me.
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: I've fought against borisin abominations for years, and I know their ferocity and cunning well. The borisin were clearly well-prepared for this prison break, and now they are staying in the shadows. They have no reason to rush out into the open.
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: When facing cunning and ferocious prey, the hunter must be more patient, biding their time to seize the golden chance for a decisive blow. Once Hoolay loses his patience and reveals himself, that's when we'll strike.
[At Dawn, To War][Yanqing]: But when will that time come?
[At Dawn, To War][Feixiao]: Like I said... it's only one meal away.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: After the Shackling Prison BreakIn the Seat of Divine Foresight
[At Dawn, To War][Yukong]: General Huaiyan, the Sky-Faring Commission has finished its preparations. Do you have any other instructions?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Representing the consensus between the Merlin's Claw and the Divine Foresight, I'll step in as the temporary commanding officer of the Seat of Divine Foresight and oversee the Six Commissions' affairs on the Luofu.
[At Dawn, To War][Yukong]: What is the situation at The Shackling Prison?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Hoolay made a quick escape and even sealed the gates of the prison. As of now, the Cloud Knights have re-established contact with the staff inside.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: The good news is, the two Nameless who were trapped in The Shackling Prison are safe and sound.
[At Dawn, To War][March 7th]: Um, I know I shouldn't use the word "great" given the current situation... but I'm relieved that  and Dan Heng are safe.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: We've lost contact with one of the messengers from the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The borisin have likely taken him hostage.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Don't worry, Yukong. Feixiao is leading the Wolf Hunt operation, and you know how capable she is.
[At Dawn, To War][Yukong]: I have no doubt about General Feixiao's capabilities, General Huaiyan. I'm more concerned about the Wardance.
[At Dawn, To War][Yukong]: According to the plan, the ceremony will begin in six hours. The Skysplitter will be activated, and all visitors will board the ship to watch the contest.
[At Dawn, To War][Yukong]: But now, with Hoolay's whereabouts unknown, everything is filled with uncertainty.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Should the Wardance really be held as scheduled?
[At Dawn, To War][Yunli]: March is right, Grandpa. I heard the escaped prisoner from The Shackling Prison is beyond formidable. In case anything goes wrong...
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: So, Yunli, what do you think we should do?
[At Dawn, To War][Yunli]: Well... hmm... I believe we should declare martial law and allocate manpower to search for the escaped prisoners. And for the Wardance, it's better to announce an indefinite delay for now.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Your plan sounds solid, but unfortunately, solid plans rarely get a chance to be implemented. I believe there are at least two parties who won't accept your approach.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Which two parties?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: The first are the many travelers who have come all the way here for the Wardance. If we declare martial law now, it's like declaring that the Luofu isn't safe. How do you think the outsiders would react? They'd be terrified, and chaos might ensue.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: The second party is the staff of the Xianzhou Luofu's Six Commissions. They've invested a lot of resources and manpower into organizing the Wardance. Suddenly suspending it indefinitely would create numerous challenges for them.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: But of course, not everyone disagrees with your idea.
[At Dawn, To War][Yunli]: ...R—Really?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: The mastermind behind this incident would fully support your opinion presumably.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Hoolay's escape and your discovery of borisin spies at Stargazer Navalia... Even a child could guess that these events were orchestrated.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: The fugitive is just one piece in the game. The one controlling the pieces wants to spread chaos and suspicion among the people on the Luofu. If we declare martial law and postpone the Wardance, we'll fall into their trap and instill fear in people even before Hoolay actually does anything.
[At Dawn, To War][Yunli]: ...So, what do we do?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: We'll search for the prisoners while maintaining order on the Luofu, acting as if nothing has happened.
[At Dawn, To War][Yunli]: As if nothing has happened? Yanqing said he'd assist the generals, and now he's nowhere to be found. With the host's ringmaster gone, how are we supposed to act like nothing has happened?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: That's why I called the two of you here.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Are you suggesting that I take Yanqing's place as ringmaster?
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Are you suggesting that Yunli takes Yanqing's place as ringmaster?
[At Dawn, To War][March 7th]: Master Yunli, is General Huaiyan asking you to be the ringmaster instead of Yanqing?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: No, that's not the case.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Are you planning to take up the role of the ringmaster yourself, General Huaiyan?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Of course I'll do my part, but not on the Skysplitter.
[At Dawn, To War][March 7th]: General Huaiyan... Are you asking me... to take Yanqing's place... as the ringmaster?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: You caught on quickly, Miss March! That's exactly what I mean.
[At Dawn, To War][Yunli]: But Miss March is a guest invited by General Jing Yuan, Grandpa! How can an outsider represent the Luofu in the ring? It will make the Xianzhou Luofu a laughingstock.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Dear child, the Nameless of the Astral Express are renowned throughout the cosmos! It's an honor to have them participate in the ceremony! Plus, Miss March is a disciple of the little Cloud Knight Lieutenant. How can she be regarded as an "outsider"?
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: We can't afford to have any problems during the Wardance. I'm entrusting you not only with the honor of the ring, but also with the security of the Skysplitter.
[At Dawn, To War][Huaiyan]: Yukong, please explain to them the rest of the arrangements.
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: Switching to Lingsha's POV...
[At Dawn, To War][Narration]: In The Shackling Prison, Lingsha, Dan Heng, and Jing Yuan are trying to discern clues from the borisin's attacks...

[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: Three dual-hours before the Wardance convenesIn The Shackling Prison
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Hanya]: I am sorry for our improper management, and I truly appreciate your assistance, General.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: There is no need to apologize. We Cloud Knights fight on the battlefield, while you judges punish the criminals. We are two sides of the same Xianzhou Luofu, and it is my honor to serve the Ten-Lords Commission.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: I've grasped the situation of the prison break. Now, tell me more about the current state of The Shackling Prison.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Hanya]: Borisin infiltrated the prison in disguise and released the prisoners, spreading chaos.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Hanya]: Among the judges on duty in the four divisions, Judge Xueyi from the Detention Division was killed and is temporarily unavailable. So, I'm taking over her duties and commanding Aurumaton Spectral Envoys and spiritfarers to quickly restore order in the affected areas.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: I, and the two behind me, will go deeper into the prison to investigate.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Hanya]: But General, the situation inside is still chaotic and perilous. Your presence would be...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: It's common for Cloud Knight generals to face danger directly. Hoolay has escaped, and the Yaoqing envoy is being held hostage by the borisin. His fate is unknown. This is a grave matter.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Not only did the Merlin's Claw offer no reproach, she decided to go after Hoolay herself to prevent further calamity. I believe the Luofu owes her something in return for her fervent determination...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: How did the infiltrators learn about the location where Hoolay was held? And how did they time their plan just before the Yaoqing messengers were ready to escort him...?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Finding the answers to these questions shouldn't be too difficult. What truly matters is if we can gather the clues that lead us to the mastermind behind all of this.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Hanya]: I understand, but I'm afraid it won't be an easy task.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: For a long time, this hidden force has been pursuing their own goals and undermining the security of the Luofu. Backing down now will only encourage them to further endanger the peace here.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Hanya]: The Ten-Lords Commission will support your decision with everything we have, General.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Dan Heng and Lingsha, I'll need both of you to accompany me on this challenging journey.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Well, it's part of my responsibilities as the Cauldron Master. So, where would you like to start, General?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Let's start with those borisin disguised as foxians.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: My people have already prepared the evidence.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: According to Lieutenant Yanqing's report, he stumbled upon a few suspicious foxians at Stargazer Navalia. After following them, he discovered that they were actually borisin in disguise. This is one of the bodies.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: Looking at him now, it's hard to imagine how he transformed into a foxian.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: My alchemists detected some... complex ingredients in his remains, which might explain how these borisin were able to disguise themselves as foxians.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Simply put, foxians and borisin share a common ancestry. Although they look completely different now, there isn't much genetic difference between them. This medicine allows borisin to temporarily change their shape into that of foxians.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: So, in other words, if they stop taking the medicine, their true form will soon be revealed?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: Borisin have fast metabolisms, so the effects of medicines don't last long...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Indeed. This means that these borisin have a steady supply of the medicine within the Luofu.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: An infiltration technique the general is familiar with...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: The formula and technique seem oddly familiar.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Looks like the Alchemy Commission is involved once again.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: When I was sorting through the prescriptions they used, I came across one called "Semblance Reversion Essence." It's designed to help those disciples suppress signs of their mara-struck form and maintain their normal appearance. When I compared it to the medicine found in the borisin's body...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: They're one and the same, aren't they?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: The medicinal properties and ingredients may differ, but the principle remains the same.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Since ancient times, the borisin have always sought to have more powerful bodies, regarding the foxians as weaklings. Yet, in order to save their Warhead, they were willing to disguise themselves as foxians... Their determination is quite remarkable.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: If these infiltrators rely on the medicine to maintain their disguise, then following this lead in our investigation seems prudent. Please follow me.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Here we are. According to the judge, this area is not yet under control, so we should proceed cautiously.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: I've captured the nature of the medicine in my censer.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: By following the medicinal fumes, we should be able to retrace the steps of the disguised borisin.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: A prison guard is collapsed on the ground, her body twisted unnaturally.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Incredible strength... The attacker shattered this warden's bones with a single blow.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Such brute strength is not something an ordinary borisin possesses... This is likely the work of Hoolay.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: If I may be so bold to ask, is this borisin truly that formidable?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: I have lived a bit longer and engaged in a few more battles than you, Miss Lingsha. To the Alliance, borisin have always been the most formidable adversaries, and Hoolay is a monster feared even among his own kind.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: With his strength, Hoolay united numerous borisin packs, forming a grand army of Abominations of Abundance. They constantly pushed the Alliance's armies into perilous positions.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Over seven centuries ago, I followed my mentor on a campaign against the abominations, and I personally witnessed the devastation on the battlefield after Hoolay appeared.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Even with medicinal pellets that suppressed the fear caused by his Lupitoxin, countless Cloud Knights succumbed to panic in the face of his murderous aura. They couldn't even raise a hand in resistance... If the former Sword Champion hadn't immobilized Hoolay with her Frost Blade, the outcome of that fateful battle could have been very different.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: By the end of the battle, only a few of us remained. "The crimson moon casts the sheen of blood on all"... Everything I saw was painted dark red.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: If that's the case, why wasn't the beast executed instead of being imprisoned?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: On the Xianzhou Zhuming, the judges cast those unforgivable and nearly immortal Abominations of Abundance into the eternal flames of the stars, reducing them to ashes.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Their so-called "immortality" is just a facade. I mean, nothing can truly defy death, can it? I just don't understand why the Luofu kept this tumor for so long, leading to the terrible situation we're facing now.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: But I guess I understand. The people of the Luofu are known for their kindness. Even when faced with the malignant tumor within the Alchemy Commission, they couldn't bring themselves to cut it out. Instead, they exiled the healer who tried to solve the problem to the Xianzhou Zhuming.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: I understand if you hold grudges against me, Miss Lingsha. I take the blame for the resurgence of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. As for why Hoolay was only imprisoned... I can shed some light on that too.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: I'm just a healer, and I'm not familiar with the past. I'd appreciate it if you could enlighten me, General.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Alright, let me tell you more about it as we go.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: ...Did this Cloud Knight also take the medicine?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: Lingsha peels open the Cloud Knight's armor and stretches out her hands to search for a moment.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: No, this is a borisin in disguise. A guard killed him before he could return to his original form.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: All these borisin are dressed in official attire. Besides the Cloud Knight, there were also two borisin disguised as members of the Sky-Faring Commission and the Artisanship Commission.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Whoever is providing them with official identities must hold a position of power... Let's search elsewhere.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: A prisoner is on the ground. The joy of regaining freedom and sudden shock, these two expressions are frozen on his pale face at the moment of death.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: Someone bit open his arteries and drained almost all of his blood while he was still alive. Such a cruel and ruthless act...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Despite being a long-lived species, borisin are actually more like predatory beasts that must feed on raw blood and flesh. I've heard that Hoolay was deprived of food and water in The Shackling Prison...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: It's hard to imagine how he managed to suppress his hunger for over seven centuries. Will the hostage from the Yaoqing be able to avoid being his meal?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Such is the terrible nature of the Abominations of Abundance. We subjected him to the Forest of Swords to drain his life force, but in the end, his punishment turned into a test of our patience.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Just like you said, Miss Lingsha, casting a creature that can't be killed into a star would be a way to permanently get rid of it, but unfortunately...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: ...The foxians didn't agree to that.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Exactly. The atrocities committed by Hoolay went beyond mere massacres. Throughout numerous wars, we made every effort to eradicate the borisin, but Hoolay, with his mysterious sorcery, turned countless foxians into his pawns, and so the borisin kept returning.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: The foxians curse his name day and night, and they even use it to scare children into staying quiet. How could they grant a swift death to such a great sinner?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: I wonder if you know why Hoolay wasn't taken into custody by the foxian-majority Xianzhou Yaoqing, but instead imprisoned in the Xianzhou Luofu, Miss Lingsha.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: As you mentioned, your mentor was an exceptional warrior and was the one who defeated Hoolay, an extraordinary achievement. Therefore, the marshal placed this feral beast under the jurisdiction of the Xianzhou Luofu as an honor, I assume?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: It seems you have a major misunderstanding about this arrangement, Miss Lingsha. Allow me to explain it to you.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: The wolf-shaped mech disintegrates into a pile of metal.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Yanqing told me that an IPC ship was attacked by borisin. Is this what they were transporting on the ship?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: A biomimetic weapon that will auto-restart even after being turned off...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: The Intelligentsia Guild's research on the traits of longevity...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Yes, the Artisanship Commission and Alchemy Commission conducted a joint examination and found that... the parts of this machine are made from specially refined borisin bio-tissue.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: I heard the Intelligentsia Guild has been researching the biological properties of long-life species, hoping to make medical or combat-related discoveries. However, they haven't dared to cross any lines due to their so-called "relationship" with the Alliance.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: Perhaps to those scholars, borisin are no different from lab animals. Maybe the borisin attacked that ship to retaliate against the Intelligentsia Guild for experimenting on them?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: No, if it were only about revenge, they could just wreck the ship and destroy all the cargo, instead of allowing it to end up in The Shackling Prison.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: It was a deliberate display to showcase the dangerous nature of the "cargo" in broad daylight. This way, the cargo would end up in The Shackling Prison, serving as a tool for the prison break.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: This skill in exploiting the blind spots of others' mindsets is so atypical of them. I'm afraid the IPC and the Intelligentsia Guild unknowingly became their accomplices.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: Something seems to be hiding in the pile of metal on the ground, ready to move.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: Watch out. This thing is still alive!
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: It can regenerate even after suffering such severe attacks?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Their imitation of long-life species has crossed the line.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: If it can still move, it means it wasn't damaged enough.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Let's make sure it never moves again.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: The giant machine goes silent again. Like a wounded beast drained of blood, it can no longer move.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: You haven't answered my question about why Hoolay was imprisoned in the Luofu instead of the Yaoqing, General. You've been reserved in your response. Could it be that such an arrangement wasn't an honor?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: The reason why the marshal didn't leave Hoolay on the Yaoqing lies in the very mech in front of us.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: ...Are you suggesting that there are people trying to understand Hoolay's secrets and use them for their own purposes, just like with this mech?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Well, I understand. I've heard that the foxians on the Yaoqing share a bloodline with the borisin, and just like the borisin, some of the foxians there experience an uncontrollable insanity called Moon Rage.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: The marshal believed that this would be inhumane and no different from what the borisin did, so...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Exactly. While borisin see Moon Rage as a blessing that unlocks their true potential, foxians see it as an inevitable curse within their bloodline. Countless healers of the Yaoqing have attempted to unravel this mystery, but to no avail.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: "Why can borisin control the power of Moon Rage?" "Can we foxians break free from this curse?" ...These questions were asked frequently.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Each questioner had good intentions, but the road to catastrophe is paved with good intentions.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: To the foxians of the Yaoqing, Hoolay was not only the Warhead of the borisin but also a monster that could be the subject of much research. Hoolay thus became a poison that corrupted people's minds without their knowing.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: That's why the marshal decided to imprison Hoolay in the Luofu. It wasn't an honor but rather... a warning.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Because such selfish pursuits in the name of "good intentions" once led to a tragedy on the Luofu that served as a warning to future generations.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: The Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: By imprisoning Hoolay in the Xianzhou Luofu, the marshal both suppressed the dangerous intentions of the Yaoqing foxians and warned the Xianzhou Luofu to refrain from repeating its mistake.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: That was a necessary trade-off. The Xianzhou Alliance is not solely about the Xianzhou natives. Only when all three races — Foxian, Vidyadhara, and Xianzhou natives — form an alliance will there be a promising future for all.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Thank you for enlightening me. Was it for the same reason that you "traded off" my mentor to the Xianzhou Zhuming, only to stand idle and allow the resurgence of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: You said that I couldn't bear to cut out the malignant tumor within the Alchemy Commission but instead exiled the healer who tried to solve the problem to the Xianzhou Zhuming...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: But did your mentor tell you... her "good intentions" led her to perform certain healing arts on Dan Heng, who had just finished his hatching rebirth, so that he would regain the memories of his past life?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng and Lingsha]: What did you just say?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: She believed that restoring the High Elder's knowledge of his past life would allow the Vidyadhara to resume their duty as the guardians of the Ambrosial Arbor, quelling the strife within their clan and bringing everything back on the right path.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: But just as I mentioned earlier, the road to catastrophe is always paved with good intentions. Since then, the Six Charioteers decided that the Alchemy Commission would no longer have a Cauldron Master, until your arrival now.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: If that's the case, I should thank you for protecting my mentor by exiling her, General.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Quite the contrary. I should be the one thanking you.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Thanking me?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: All I ever want is to have a clear conscience. However, can long-life species truly achieve that goal in their long-drawn lives? For example, you were implicated along with your mentor and forced to leave your homeland without knowing the truth.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: And now, with the complicated situation in the Alchemy Commission, the Alliance has spared me a lot of trouble by sending you to handle this challenging task. Shouldn't I be thanking you instead?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: ...Your eloquence is indeed impressive, the Divine Foresight. You won't even leave me any excuses to hold a grudge against you.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: But let me make it clear: The Alliance sent me here to handle the business impartially, not to choose sides.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: It doesn't matter which side you choose, Miss Lingsha. At the end of the day, both you and I stand on the side of the Alliance, don't we? Let's keep going.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: A mess of bodies, a fierce battle must have been fought here.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: These mara-struck soldiers... don't appear to be escaped prisoners.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: How can you tell?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: These soldiers are fully armed. Obviously, they didn't hastily join the battle.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: The messenger named Moze did say that there were two groups of attackers. The other attackers, aside from the borisin, could hide their tracks. I believe he was referring to these people.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Hide their tracks?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: Exactly. I've engaged with these attackers before, and they used cloudhymn magic to hide their presence. Without careful observation, no one can detect them.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: You once warned me to be cautious of the Vidyadhara Elders' influence within the Alchemy Commission. Could it be...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: What's on your mind, Miss Lingsha?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Well, it seems that someone provided the attackers with a map of The Shackling Prison. And considering the Vidyadhara's involvement in the prison's construction, it raises suspicions about their role in this.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Additionally, the fact that the borisin need medicine to disguise themselves suggests that there are still moles within the Alchemy Commission assisting them covertly.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Moreover, forging official identities for the undercover borisin would require someone with significant authority.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: And the presence of assassins capable of using cloudhymn magic deepens my suspicions about the Preceptors.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: But why would the Vidyadhara collude with the borisin and aid in Hoolay's escape?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: They aim to spread chaos. They believe that only in chaos can they regain their former power and influence.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: Since the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the once-proud dragon race has been powerless, watching their influence wane. Being a native of the Luofu, Miss Lingsha, I believe you understand the implications.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: However, I don't think the Preceptors are the true masterminds. If I'm not mistaken, the one behind all this treachery is the Lord Ravager who exploited the weaknesses within the Luofu and instigated the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, ultimately leading to the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection — Phantylia.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Please remember, General, that everything I've mentioned is mere speculation. We need concrete evidence for a public trial. If you want to interrogate someone within the Vidyadhara's ranks, you'll need irrefutable proof.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: So, what's your plan, Miss Lingsha?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: I'll send an "invitation" to the Preceptors.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Dan Heng]: An invitation?
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: The Preceptors have been inviting me for a personal meeting since my arrival on the Luofu. Now, I'll send them the remains of these mara-struck soldiers and the route map I found in the prisoner's possession. Then, I'll ask them to meet me at Scalegorge Waterscape.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: I'd like to hear their explanations.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: Good idea. If I were to take action, it might alert the true mastermind. I trust you to handle this matter, Miss Lingsha. The internal affairs of the Vidyadhara should remain under their jurisdiction.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Jing Yuan]: And don't worry even if things don't go smoothly. Once the Wolf Hunt operation is over, the hidden truths will come to light.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: Speaking of the Wolf Hunt operation, I'm truly worried about the Yaoqing messenger who was taken hostage. Hoolay was starving in The Shackling Prison for centuries... I don't know if the messenger can survive in that wolf's clutches.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Lingsha]: May Reignbow's blessing keep him safe.
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: Switching to Jiaoqiu's POV...
[A Web of Pasts Rewoven][Narration]: Falling into the hands of the borisin, Jiaoqiu is trying to find a chance to survive... but it is not his own chance that he seeks.

[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Two dual-hours before the Wardance convenesExalting Sanctum
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: As I said, I'm a healer, but my art of healing requires the culinary arts to be truly effective.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: The magic of my cauldron is its ability to make all kinds of medicines into dishes that patients can eat. When simmered and cooked together, any kind of medicinal herb or ingredient becomes a delightful delicacy.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Delicacy... but isn't that just one flavor overpowering the others?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Well, you have a point... Let me ask you this: If there's a fussy child who refuses to eat green peppers, what's the best way to make him eat them?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Stuff the kid's mouth with the green peppers and cook him alive in a pot.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Hahahaha! You have quite a sense of humor. I've heard that you borisin have lost many of your taste buds during the self-modification process, so you can't experience complex flavors. Only the "saltiness" of blood and flesh truly awakens your appetite.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: It's a shame I don't have any green peppers right now. Otherwise, I'd happily stuff them into your mouth and cook you alive in a pot.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: I'm just kidding. The answer is quite simple: Chop up the peppers and mix them with minced meat to make meatballs. This way, the flavor of the meat overpowers the taste of the peppers, and even a fussy child can enjoy them.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Can I just boil your tongue in this hot pot? I know you're trying to buy time until someone comes to your rescue.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: You said that Jingliu recently returned to the Luofu, right? Well, she did come back... but unfortunately, I also found out that she committed serious crimes and was escorted to another Xianzhou ship.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Do you really think you can delay our departure by provoking Lord Hoolay's desire for revenge with your clever little tongue?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: You see borisin as savages who know nothing about the Xianzhou, but in fact, we know all about your tracking tricks... like the jade abacus you're carrying and the cycranes in the sky.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: The more hope you hold in your heart, the greater your pain will be when death comes. I wonder if you can maintain your composure when I tear your throat open.
[Alone In Peril][???]: His composure is only a temporary effect of the medicine, and it will wear off soon, right?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Lord Hoolay.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: You pathetic foxians. For thousands of years, we were the ones who allowed you to live and who granted you civilization, but in the end, you chose to betray us for the "freedom" promised by the Xianzhou people.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: But it's alright. As long as you catch the scent of your masters, you obediently return to us... no matter how far you run away.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Run away, you said? Well, I'm not the one who's trying to run away right now.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Hoolay, have you ever wondered why it took them seven centuries to come to your rescue?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: ...
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: The borisin's era has long passed. Did they ever tell you these harsh facts before giving you hope for returning home, Lord Hoolay?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Now they're being crushed by the Merlin's Claw of the Yaoqing... by a foxian. They're hiding in remote corners of the cosmos, trembling with fear, like a wounded beast on its last legs, reaching out desperately for any fake hope of salvation, which in this case is you.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: The Merlin's Claw of the Yaoqing... A foxian? Very interesting. Tell me, Mok Tok, is he speaking the truth?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: ...He isn't lying. That lowly beast was a war slave who ran away from our pack! Cannon fodder! A thief! She stole our power and used her knowledge about us to fight us, using every dirty trick in the book...
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: And she bested you, Mok Tok. Fairness is but a pathetic excuse for the dead and defeated. Since our great pack has fallen apart, who told you that I was alive? And who sent you here?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: In our darkest hours, it was a Prophet of the Master of Immortality, named Mangas, who showed us the way. Her guidance brought us hope.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: This Prophet Mangas... What does she want?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: The Prophet made this proclamation: The borisin have been divided for too long, and only your return can unite all the packs, restoring us to our former glory! That's when we learned that you were still alive... It must have been a manifestation of the Master of Immortality!
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: And the Prophet told us that the foxian general of the Yaoqing would take you to her ship during the Luofu's Wardance, and that it would be our best chance to infiltrate and free you from your prison. And just as she said, we did it!
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Even if you managed to set Hoolay free, you'd have no way to escape.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: We've already prepared our ships, and the Prophet's prediction will surely come true.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: That so-called prophet lied to all of you. She just sent you here to die.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: But her prophecy has come true! Our Warhead is right here, with us!
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Once the news about the prison break spreads, the Cloud Knights will close all the ports. You may think you've escaped the prison, but you're just trapped in another cage known as the Luofu.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Let me kill this unruly lowly beast, Lord Hoolay! I assure you that our starskiffs will soon arrive.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Right now, everyone in the Luofu is distracted by the stupid Wardance, so this will be the perfect chance to escape. Once you've returned to your territory, your revenge against the Xianzhou ships will be within reach.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Perfect chance? To return to my weak and shattered pack, at the mercy of a ridiculous false prophet, and become a mere puppet in her clutches? Heh, her plan is full of flaws. The only paths she has prepared for you are escape and death.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Listen up, a wolf never allows itself to become prey. From now on, you'll follow my orders.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Since you are so confident that the Cloud Knights will close the ports, Jiaoqiu, I'm now giving you a chance to go and see it for yourself. Go to the ports, come back, and tell me what you saw.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: ...Wait, what did you just say?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: But my Lord...!
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Would an alpha wolf ever listen to a cub, Mok Tok?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: No, I've never heard anything like that... I... I wasn't trying to defy your will. I will always unquestioningly follow your orders.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Why don't you send your people?
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don't you want to run away, Jiaoqiu?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: What game are you playing?
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Just a little pre-hunt entertainment. Don't you want to run away?
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: You will come back, because foxians like you always obediently return to their masters... no matter how far they run away.
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: I don't fully understand Lord Hoolay's intentions, but don't think you can simply run away. Understood?
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: You know why I'm letting you go? Because foxians like you always obediently return to their masters... no matter how far they run away.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Head to the port and report back to me. Let's see if they really closed it like you expected.
[Alone In Peril][Injured Fugitive]: Water... I need some water.
[Alone In Peril][Injured Fugitive]: What the heck was I thinking...? If I knew it would end like this, I would've stayed in The Shackling Prison. Better to live in shackles than die free.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Let me take a look. I can help you out.
[Alone In Peril][Injured Fugitive]: Are you a healer? Please bandage me up... I don't want to die.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Do you know where we are?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Do you know where we are right now?
[Alone In Peril][Injured Fugitive]: I don't know. I was brought here blindfolded, just like you.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Injured Fugitive]: I don't want to die yet...
[Alone In Peril][Disguised Borisin]: Why are you wasting time here?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: You are borisin.
[Alone In Peril][Disguised Borisin]: That's right.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: You look exactly like a foxian...
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: So, that's how you managed to infiltrate the Xianzhou ship. If I hadn't been so familiar with the scent of borisin, I wouldn't have been able to tell.
[Alone In Peril][Disguised Borisin]: Never heard of such miraculous medicine, huh?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Disguised Borisin]: Lord Hoolay ordered you to go to the port and take a look, you lowly beast. Why are you still lingering here?
[Alone In Peril][Disguised Borisin]: Lord Hoolay ordered you to go to the port and take a look, you lowly beast. Why are you still lingering here?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: A foxian with a cold expression gazes at Jiaoqiu. There is sharp pressure to the gaze, carrying as if a warning to the healer that says: "Every clever little thought you bear might lead to severe consequence you will come to regret."
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: The starskiff pilot is just an ordinary but hardworking individual who ferries people from place to place every day. Understand if you thoughtless ask him for aid, you will reap severe repercussions regardless if the outcome is a success or failure. ...Remember: Be mindful of your words and actions.
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: Would you like to board my starskiff?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: You keenly notice that the foxian passengers near the Starskiff Pilot are looking you up and down.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Yes, but we have several passengers...
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: How many passengers can you accommodate?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: Well, my little starskiff can't accommodate that many... but I have a larger one that will arrive in less than fifteen minutes if you need it. So, where would you like to go?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: We need to hurry, wherever we're going. The Wardance is about to start, and the Sky-Faring Commission is prioritizing starskiffs heading to the Skysplitter.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Have the Cloud Knights closed the ports?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: Closed the ports...? Why would they do that?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: I want to get outside the Jade Gate. Can you take me there?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: What? Are you joking? How can I take you beyond the Jade Gate in this tiny starskiff?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Can we keep this quiet?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: Keep what quiet? Hahahahaha! Come on, spill it if you have something to say.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Can you give me a ride out of here?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: You want to leave alone now? Sure, the starting fare is six strales. Where do you want to go?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: You were searched by the borisin, and now you have no money on you.
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: Hey, you can't take my starskiff for free. Maybe you should withdraw some money first? I'll be ready whenever you are.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Could you deliver a message to the Realm-Keeping Commission for me?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: The Realm-Keeping Commission? It's right up ahead. Look, I've got a business to run, so why don't you go there yourself?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Never mind. I just wanted to ask if your starskiff is safe enough.
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: Hah! I've been in this business for almost a century! You won't find a safer starskiff around here!
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: The Realm-Keeping Commission orderly is not accustomed to handling emergencies like this one. Understand if you thoughtless ask him for aid, you will reap severe repercussions regardless if the outcome is a success or failure. ...Remember: Be mindful of your words and actions.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: I'm sorry, but the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery is currently closed. All the officers and officials have been reassigned to assist in the Wardance.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: You can sense someone staring at you from not far away.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: I need your help.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: If I can help you...
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Borisin are hiding nearby.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: ...Borisin? Here? Are you serious?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: These borisin are disguised as foxians. Please warn the Cloud Knights immediately.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: Will you please wait here for a while? I'll find a soldier.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: I'm Jiaoqiu, envoy of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: Hi, do you need my help, messenger from the Xianzhou Yaoqing?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Borisin are hiding in the Exalting Sanctum. You must deliver this news to the Cloud Knights.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: ...Borisin? Here? Are you serious?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: These borisin are disguised as foxians. Please warn the Cloud Knights immediately.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: Will you please wait here for a while? I'll find a soldier.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: No, it's nothing.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: It's nothing. I'm just wandering around.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: Hey, although we're short-staffed at the moment, if there's anything I can do to help, please feel free to ask me.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: The Cloud Knights Soldier on duty here is alone and without reinforcements. Understand if you thoughtless ask her for aid, you will reap severe repercussions regardless if the outcome is a success or failure. ...Remember: Be mindful of your words and actions.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Hey there, I noticed you've been looking at me for quite a while. Do you need my help?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: You can sense someone staring at you from not far away.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: I need your help.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Could you please provide more details?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Borisin are hiding nearby.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: What!? Are you sure about that?
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Wait... I recognize you... You're the lost Yaoqing messenger. How are you here?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: I was brought here by the borisin. Please make sure to report this news.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Alright, I'll call for reinforcements.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: I'm Jiaoqiu, envoy of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Wait... I recognize you... You're the lost Yaoqing messenger. How are you here?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: I was brought here by the borisin. Please make sure to report this news.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Alright, I'll call for reinforcements.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: No, it's nothing.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: It's nothing. I'm just wandering around.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Understood. Please come to me if you need any help.
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: Stop asking. I'm off-duty now. Go bother someone else.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: You sniff a familiar scent on the foxian pilot.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: May I ask why?
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: Can't you just stop asking?
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: What if the Warhead wants to leave?
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: ...
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: You're not one of us, but I smell a familiar scent on you.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: The Warhead sent me here to check on the situation.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Have the Cloud Knights closed the ports?
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: No, not at all. Instead, the Sky-Faring Commission is clearing routes to prioritize starskiffs heading to the Skysplitter. This will make our ships more noticeable when we try to escape.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: The Warhead wants to know if we can leave now.
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: Not yet. There's no way for this tiny ship to escape from the Xianzhou. Only the starships at Stargazer Navalia can break through the Jade Gate. Mok Tok said there would be insiders to pick us up, but I haven't heard anything yet.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: 
[Alone In Peril][Suspicious Ferryman]: What exactly is happening... We should have received word from Stargazer Navalia long ago.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: You're back, Jiaoqiu.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: You were closely watching me, weren't you? And if I sought help from anyone, your people would kill them... Was that your plan, Hoolay?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Come and take a good look. Who is this person?
[Alone In Peril][Starskiff Pilot]: This Cloud Knight says there's official business that requires my cooperation.
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Don't worry, this captain will help us.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Realm-Keeping Orderly: This Cloud Knight will help you.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: What are you trying to do, Mok Tok?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: What are you trying to do, Mok Tok? They have nothing to do with this!
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Nothing to do? I told you to go to the port and check out the situation... but I never gave you permission to talk with others.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Remember, this person died because of you.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: A sickening crack of bones echoed through the small courtyard. There was no scream, not even the sound of a struggle.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: You want to prove to me that... you hold everyone's lives in your hands, right, Hoolay!?
[Alone In Peril][Mok Tok]: Come and take a good look. Who are these people?
[Alone In Peril][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Don't worry, this captain will help us.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: What are you trying to do, Mok Tok?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: What are you trying to do, Mok Tok? They have nothing to do with this!
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Nothing to do? I told you to go to the port and check out the situation... but I never gave you permission to talk with others.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Remember, these people died because of you.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: A sickening crack of bones echoed through the small courtyard. There was no scream, not even the sound of a struggle.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: You want to prove to me that... you hold everyone's lives in your hands, right, Hoolay!?
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Exactly as you said. So, have the Cloud Knights closed the ports?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: ...No.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: They don't want to publicize my escape. I understand. It's no surprise, for fear is more deadly than claws and fangs... especially during a festive time like the Wardance.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: What lurks here is not a group of fugitives, but rather a pack of wolves amidst the flock. My cubs are hungry, ready to feast on flesh and blood, reveling in your fear.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Your calm facade will soon crumble. I can tear through it and expose your pathetic bones anytime. There's no escape from me, Jiaoqiu.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Of course, you can try your luck and believe that your wits will save you. But remember, you're not the only hostage in this city. If you try anything funny, innocent people will die because of you.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Now, let's talk about the foxian general you serve. Mok Tok says she's here for me, which means she'll be hunting me herself.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Before the hunt begins, I need to know my opponent. You can refuse and play tough, or you can cooperate and save us both some time, healer.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: The tall man stretches out a finger and touches your shoulder blade with a movement so fast it's not visible.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: It's as if a dagger has cut away a piece of flesh, and the pain pierces down to the bone. You can barely stand.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Agh...
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Good, at least you didn't try to draw attention with a scream. That way, no one will die in vain.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: But remember, the next time you refuse me, I'll crush your healing hands, then your knees, then your spine... I'll dismantle you piece by piece until only your silver tongue remains for you to speak.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: ...Fine, I'll tell you what you want to know about her, but I expect something in return.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: What makes you think you're still in a position to negotiate with me?
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: You can torture me until I talk, or... let's save us both some time, Warhead.
[Alone In Peril][Jiaoqiu]: Here's the question that's been bothering me: How have you managed to survive and endure centuries of torture? Borisin aren't supposed to live that long or possess such regenerative abilities.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: So, is that why the Xianzhou Yaoqing wanted to take me away? To some, I'm a hostage, but to others, I hold the secrets they desire...
[Alone In Peril][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance By Words of Many.mp4
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: I still remember, in the early years of my captivity, the foxians came and went... They extracted my blood and marrow, trying to unravel the mystery of Moon Rage. They wanted to conquer their fear of the borisin and free themselves from their bloodline.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Unfortunately, they failed to uncover the secret, so they resorted to the most brutal punishments they could imagine.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Some seek power to destroy their enemies, while others seek power to become their enemies... Which one are you, Jiaoqiu?
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Ah, I see! You're the most pitiful of them all, healer of the Yaoqing! You seek power to share it with others and do good.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Well, then let me tell you the answer you seek.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: In our ancient legends, Duran, the ancestor of the borisin, was dissatisfied with his limited lifespan and power. He yearned to dominate the skies and become the master of all the stars.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: To achieve his goal, he sacrificed the lives of countless borisin and foxians, pouring them into the spring bestowed by the Master of Immortality. Through a form of genetic sorcery, the water gave birth to a miracle — the Lunar Embryo.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Duran ascended the birthing bed and obtained what he desired: a heart in the shape of a deep-red full moon. He cut open his chest and replaced his original heart with this crimson moon.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: How typical. Just another borisin myth...
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Laugh all you want, but only I know the truth behind every word.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: I'm not buying your absurd myth!
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: The Ambrosial Arbor is also an absurd myth, but you Xianzhou folk know it's true.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: This moon heart beats within the body of every generation of the Borisin Warhead. In the ritual that decides the new Warhead, the successor cuts open the previous Warhead's chest and consumes the divine heart, thus possessing it as their own!
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Devouring is the true essence of life, allowing us to endure and thrive. It gathers the life essence of all the prey we consume, making us stronger and stronger!
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: I thought all hope was lost after seven centuries of torment, but now, this heart is beating once again.
[Alone In Peril][Hoolay]: Alright, now it's your turn to tell me... everything about the Merlin's Claw.
[Alone In Peril][Moze]: Jiaoqiu... I've found you.
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Alone In Peril][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: I know I'm in no position to question your orders, but if I understand correctly, you already have intelligence about the borisin?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: That's right. My people are busy collecting clues now. What's the situation, Moze?
[The Red Warcry][Moze]: General, before we completely lost contact with Jiaoqiu, I picked up a signal from his jade abacus. It won't take long before we locate their whereabouts.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: If that's the case, shouldn't we immediately go there and join forces to eliminate the borisin? Why are we returning to Stargazer Navalia?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Looks like your general has only taught you swordplay, not the art of The Hunt.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: There's an old saying among the borisin: "In the forest, the hunter may easily become the hunted." While we may call ourselves the hunters now, chasing them blindly will only make us become the prey.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: How can Hoolay... possibly hunt us down?
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: But we have the advantage in numbers, right?
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: Are you joking, General? He's just a wolf who's been imprisoned for seven centuries. Even with his accomplices, they're no match for us numerous Luofu Cloud Knights. How could he consider us his prey?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Do not underestimate the enemy. Hoolay is not an ordinary borisin that can be easily killed. The advantage in numbers means nothing when we face that monster.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: A vicious beast, who hasn't tasted blood and flesh in seven centuries, is now lurking on the streets of the Luofu right before the Wardance. This is what makes the situation treacherous and unpredictable.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: To him, the lives of ordinary people are just meat, ready to be devoured at any moment...
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Exactly. That's why we must succeed in our first strike, or the situation will spiral out of control.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: You've heard of this military tactic, right? When you surround your enemy, leave one side open for them to escape. A skilled hunter must be well-prepared, waiting for the prey at the most advantageous position.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Where do those borisin want to go?
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Is Stargazer Navalia the most likely place for them to come to?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: What would we do if we were the escapees from The Shackling Prison? While we can disguise ourselves and blend in with the crowd, we don't plan on staying here for long. In this case, what do we need most now?
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: ...A starskiff to get us out of the Luofu. The borisin we discovered at Stargazer Navalia were actually preparing a vessel for their escape.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: We predict their next move, and we take them down.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Let's start from where you found those borisin and corner our prey.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: This is where we ran into the borisin last time. It looks the same as usual.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Because I blocked all the relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing had happened.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Will the borisin notice something?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Losing contact with their accomplices preparing the starskiff will surely put them on guard.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Yanqing may have alerted the borisin?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: If Yanqing hadn't scared them off, we would not have many clues.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: However, the more well-prepared a plan is, the longer it takes to adjust when it's disrupted. If any borisin wants to stick to the original plan despite the risks, they'll surely come back to Stargazer Navalia to check the situation.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: Are you suggesting that there are borisin here at Stargazer Navalia, right now?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: This is an automated area, so don't you think that there are a bit too many people here today?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: First, look at those two Sky-Faring Commission staff members. They've been observing us in secret since we arrived here.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Then, there's a Cloud Knight soldier over there. Perhaps he's here for patrol, but each patrol team must consist of two members, and obviously, he's not following the rules.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Lastly, there's that craftsman wearing Artisanship Commission clothing. He's unusually focused on checking that device.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: If you have a target in mind, let's go investigate.
[The Red Warcry][Agitated Employee]: Who are you? Don't you know that Stargazer Navalia is on lockdown now?
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Mild-Mannered Staff: Hey, chill out. They're just a few lost tourists.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Stargazer Navalia is on lockdown now?
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: ...But Stargazer Navalia is the shipbuilding port of the Xianzhou Luofu. If the Sky-Faring Commission called for a lockdown, there should be official documents proving it, right?
[The Red Warcry][Agitated Employee]: Official documents? Of course, there are. The Cloud Knights are aware that some people have infiltrated this port.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: ...That makes perfect sense. So, you're now investigating the borisin?
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Mild-Mannered Staff: Yeah, we've received orders from the higher-ups, so we've blocked off this area to prevent any interference with our inspection. Thank you for your understanding.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Mild-Mannered Staff: Yeah, we've received orders from the higher-ups, so we've blocked off this area to prevent any interference with our inspection. Thank you for your understanding.
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: Hey, you there! Please refrain from wandering around Stargazer Navalia if you're not... Oh, it's you, Lieutenant Yanqing.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Is Stargazer Navalia on lockdown now?
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: No, not at all... Actually, I'm here to address a peculiar issue.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Aren't you wandering around here as well?
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: I'm an official staff member assigned to investigate a peculiar issue.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: A peculiar issue?
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: Yeah, we've had some unscheduled starskiffs being constructed at this dock in Stargazer Navalia. Could there have been an error in the production planning for the assembly line?
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: This is just weird. I thought all the pending starskiffs from before the Wardance had been scheduled already.
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: I'm sorry, but I need to focus on my work right now. If you have any questions, we can discuss them later.
[The Red Warcry][Artisanship Commission Craftsman]: I'm sorry, but I need to focus on my work right now. If you have any questions, we can discuss them later.
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Ahh... Ah! Lieutenant Yanqing! And General Feixiao?
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: You're aware of the borisin prison break, right?
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Yeah, I've received the news, and I'll be on the alert!
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Looks like you've been keeping an eye on the Skysplitter. Have you noticed anything unusual?
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: No, everything is normal on the ship. Nothing out of the ordinary!
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: : This is not a location for a Cloud Knight on guard duty, is it?
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: Well, this spot offers a great view. Are you here to keep an eye on the Skysplitter?
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Yes...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: : You've been observing the Skysplitter for a while. Have you noticed anything?
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: ...Honestly, just watching the ship from here isn't too thrilling. I wish I could go on board and witness Lieutenant Yanqing's contests...
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Speaking of which, Lieutenant Yanqing, aren't you supposed to be on the Skysplitter? Is it alright for you to be here instead?
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: Thank you for your concern, but I have more pressing matters to attend to.
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Ah...
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: You're on duty, soldier. Stay focused!
[The Red Warcry][Cloud Knights Soldier]: Yes, ma'am!
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: So, it seems that some borisin have returned to Stargazer Navalia in disguise. The answer seems quite obvious...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: The staff members from the Sky-Faring Commission.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: That's my suspicion as well.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: The Cloud Knight soldier.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: I believe he was just slacking off. In my opinion, the staff members from the Sky-Faring Commission appear more suspicious.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: The craftsman from the Artisanship Commission.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: I think he's genuinely here to investigate the starskiffs, as he claimed. In my opinion, the staff members from the Sky-Faring Commission are the most suspicious.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Remember when I mentioned that the Cloud Knights blocked all relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing happened? Stargazer Navalia is not under lockdown.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: But on the contrary, those staff members used "Stargazer Navalia is on lockdown" as an excuse to persuade us to leave. This contradicts the Cloud Knights' plans.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Their flimsy disguise has been exposed. Even if they try to hide, there's no way they can escape us.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Mild-Mannered Staff: Why are you still here? As I said, Stargazer Navalia is on lockdown now.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: No, I never issued such an order.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Mild-Mannered Staff: Who are you?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Perhaps you haven't met me on the battlefield, but I'm certain you've heard my name. Now, I'm asking you a question, so answer me! Tell me...
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: How many more of your comrades are here? Where were you planning to meet Hoolay?
[The Red Warcry][Agitated Employee]: This woman... She's the general of the Yaoqing! What are you still waiting for!? Attack her!
[The Red Warcry][Borisin Wolftrooper]: Run! Tell Lord Mok Tok about this!
[The Red Warcry][Wolftrooper]: Why don't you kill me?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Because I need answers.
[The Red Warcry][Wolftrooper]: You were our war slave, so you should know us descendants of Duran...
[The Red Warcry][Wolftrooper]: You want me to talk? Fine, try whatever you want, but I assure you, you won't get anything from me... only fangs and blood.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: If I were to do that, I wouldn't be any different from you.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: I am the arrow that pierces the wolf's heart. I grant you a swift death.
[The Red Warcry][Wolftrooper]: ...That's exactly what I desire. Wolves that leave the pack are prepared for the fate of never returning home.
[The Red Warcry][Wolftrooper]: But sadly, you didn't catch my partner... He will alert them...
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Before you close your eyes, you should know that I allowed him to escape, because he will lead the Cloud Knights to Hoolay's hideout.
[The Red Warcry][Wolftrooper]: Arrrghhh...
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: Is this how you... "leave one side open"...? You let that borisin escape so you could track him.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: This is the most common hunting tactic used by borisin.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: I know the methods of these abominations all too well. They always leave an escape route for their prey, allowing them to flee in fear. Then they chase them like it's a game. Borisin get great satisfaction from the last struggles of their victims...
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: Have you witnessed these things firsthand? That guy called you a... war slave... What exactly have you experienced?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Well, just a hazy past that I can barely recollect. Long ago... I was one of them.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Wait, you're a borisin!?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: The word "borisin" was only used to refer to those wolf masters. I'm a foxian who was born in one of the "fallen territories"...
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: In their eyes, we're mere consumables, cannon fodder used to slow down Xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: But you're a foxian, right?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Not all foxians are lucky enough to be born on a Xianzhou ship... I grew up in one of the worlds where borisin roam, known as the "fallen territories" by the people of the Yaoqing.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: To the wolf masters, foxians are nothing but property, cannon fodder used to slow down the Xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: But you... survived. And not only that, you became the general of the Yaoqing! If I get the chance, I'd love to hear stories of your past, General.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Speaking of stories, you've reminded me that now is not the time for them. Moze, we've sent the "warning" from Stargazer Navalia. What's the situation on your end?
[The Red Warcry][Moze]: I've found them. Jiaoqiu is trying to stall Hoolay, and he signaled me... to not reveal myself.
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: Trust his judgment, and keep watching. We'll be right there.
[The Red Warcry][Yanqing]: I believe the "warning" we sent will stop Hoolay from attacking Stargazer Navalia. What will he do next?
[The Red Warcry][Feixiao]: The hunt is not over yet. Stay safe, Jiaoqiu...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: One dual-hour before the Wardance convenesExalting Sanctum
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Patient's Voice: Please... save... me...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Patient's Voice: I want to live... Doctor...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Healer's Voice: Jiaoqiu! Find a medical ingenium and give that kid a shot! Hurry!
[The Red Warcry][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance The Red Warcry 1.mp4
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: I... I see. How is the front line?
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Cloud Knight's Voice: The borisin beast ships have already landed on the Fanghu... It won't be long before this place is overrun as well.
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: What about General Yueyu... Any news from her? I'm her healer. I should stay by her side at a time like this.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Cloud Knight's Voice: She asked me to tell you that she's not coming back. She must protect the Cloudpeer Telescope.
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Cloud Knight's Voice: General asks you to... to save that kid. The girl fought desperately just to bring us all back here alive!
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Cloud Knight's Voice: I've never seen such a brutal fighting style... Her body... it's like she was split open... just like...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Healer's Voice: Her blood pressure is dropping. Do you hear me, Jiaoqiu?
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Loud and clear... Get me some Tumbledust! We've got to start the operation right now!
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: I... I will bring her back!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: ...Is that why you're so determined to learn my secrets? Do you hear me, Jiaoqiu?
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: I do. Loud and clear.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: So, she saved you all in that great battle on the Xianzhou Fanghu three decades ago, but to your surprise, you discovered her borisin bloodline while she was at death's door.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Mok Tok told me that she was a war slave who escaped from the Eclipse Pack. What a twist of fate. Turns out she's from the same clan as I am.
[The Red Warcry][Mok Tok]: Now I understand. No wonder she displayed... such astounding power, determination, and cruelty in battle...! Turns out it's all because of her borisin bloodline. Mutt... despicable mutt.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: And she used the gift of her bloodline to destroy the borisin.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Moon Rage, a blessing for wolves, and a curse for foxes. For borisin, to have their bodies torn apart by Moon Rage and transform into a beast... is the ultimate joy, but for you foxians with poor regenerative abilities, it means certain death.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: With the burning fury in her heart, that foxian general will eventually lose her sanity and indulge in endless bloodshed. The scars on her body will not be caused by enemy weapons, but by the immense power she can't withstand. One day, she will be torn apart and die as a monster.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: And in return for her saving your life, you intend to give everything to solve this impossible puzzle.
[The Red Warcry][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance The Red Warcry 2.mp4
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Hoolay... do you know the saddest thing about being a healer?
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: All this time, I've devoted my life to bringing back those who sacrificed their lives to monsters like you. I exhausted myself, and my hands trembled, but I believed everything I did was meaningful...
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: But once again, they rushed into battle, and then I heard of their deaths. They died under your claws, in your jaws, amidst the flames of crashing starskiffs, and under the Lux Arrow of Reignbow...
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Like a useless idiot, I saved a fish named "Life" out of the cauldron called "Death," only to watch it struggle and dive back into the boiling broth.
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: So I asked myself, why were they so eager to run toward their death after they had recovered from their wounds? Why wouldn't they value their hard-won life? All the doubts left me feeling lost...
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Heh... I can smell your desperation, all the way down to your bone marrow.
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Eventually, I realized that their deaths held value. They placed the weight of their sacrifice on the living, granting us strength. With a coin forged by their deaths, they exchanged something more in return...
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Everything I'm doing now, following you so closely, is for just one reason: Witnessing your death with my own two eyes...
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Even your death has value. It will pave the way for a peaceful Wardance and a fully cured Feixiao.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Hmph, the thoughts in your pathetic head are hardly surprising.
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Did you already know this?
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Yes, I did. As borisin, we understand the value of "death" more than anyone. And as a healer who has witnessed so much death, you won't be swayed by fear.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: What a shame. What a shame. Your story actually sparked a trace of respect for you in my heart.
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Can you even feel "respect"... with your corrupted heart?
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Of course, because I caught a whiff of my own kind in you. Unfortunately, in the end, you're still just a weak fox.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: As the Wolf's Creed goes: Gift the wolf a dead end, where new paths arise. Raise him to a doomed fate, where satiation lies. The cowards, in forgotten corners, meet their unworthy demise. Yet the valorous, in brutal battles, embrace their eternal prize...
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: That's why I'm keeping you alive for now. I want to show you how borisin truly respect their enemies.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: We will consume your flesh and blood, nourishing our own. We will crush your hopes and dreams, clearing a path for our hunt! Your feeble souls will witness a new future, a future that belongs to me!
[The Red Warcry][Mok Tok]: My Lord! We've received a message. Our arrangement at Stargazer Navalia has been discovered. We must act quickly!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: That doesn't surprise me at all.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Mok Tok... What's that noise?
[The Red Warcry][Mok Tok]: It's the Skysplitter. The ship that the Wardance will be held on is about to set off! The Sky-Faring Commission will clear the air routes! And if our starskiffs try to escape, we'll be spotted.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Calm down, Mok Tok! Look at you now, hiding and fearful... Where is your borisin dignity?
[The Red Warcry][Mok Tok]: As I said, I'd sacrifice my dignity for your return! As long as you can come back to the borisin packs, there's still hope!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Hope? The borisin have forgotten the Wolf's Creed! Weak creatures put their hope in the strong, but the strong fight their way out!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Bringing me back instead of choosing a new master only proves the decline of our pack. And as for the prophet who manipulated you into saving me, she's just a liar trying to use Duran's offspring!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Mok Tok, let me tell you how the borisin will rise to power! We won't hide like rats in the streets of the Xianzhou! We will be ravenous wolves, walking amidst a herd of lambs with our fangs bared.
[The Red Warcry][Mok Tok]: But Great Warhead, our packs are not here! We can't go to war like this!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Our packs are not here? Wherever I go, everyone is the pack!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Mok Tok, we're the apex predators at the top of the hierarchy.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: As wolves, we create fear. We don't become servants to it. If you're blind to the path, I will be the crimson moon that lights the way for you.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Share my crimson blood with our brethren! Use it to infect those foxians and strike fear into their hearts!
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Now, you devious monkey... Come out and face me!
[The Red Warcry][Moze]: ...Jiaoqiu.
[The Red Warcry][Jiaoqiu]: Moze... run...
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: No, he can't run, and neither can you. You've come at the right time, monkey of the Yaoqing. Tell your general...
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Tell her, that I will unleash a massacre here, drowning the Xianzhou Luofu in blood. From this moment on, wolves bearing my blood will hunt on every street, feasting on the followers of that Devilish Archer.
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Follow me, my cubs! We shall stride among the prey!
[The Red Warcry][Mok Tok and Wolftrooper]: Gift the wolf a dead end, where new paths arise. Raise him to a doomed fate, where satiation lies. The cowards in forgotten corners, meet their unworthy demise. Yet the valorous, in brutal battles, embrace their eternal prize...
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: Do you hear that? The rumble of the cannons... it brings back all the memories of past battles within me...
[The Red Warcry][Hoolay]: My return will bring back the Wolf's Creed. In my own way, I shall save our weakened pack and restore it to its former glory!
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: Switching to March 7th's POV...
[The Red Warcry][Narration]: On Huaiyan's orders, March 7th and Yunli board the Skysplitter, participating in the Wardance Ceremony as scheduled...

[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The Wardance is about to commenceSkysplitter
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Wow! The Skysplitter's gun salute is really loud! So this is what the Wardance is actually like? I feel like my eardrums are going to burst.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Well, how could they expect to attract people to come and watch if they didn't make a huge spectacle? March, you haven't forgotten what you came to do, have you?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: What... did I come to do?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing here?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Look around you, do you remember anything?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Ah, memories of falling from the sky into Taikiyan Stadium have come flooding back to me. We... came to compete, didn't we?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Great, you've finally gotten your memory back, and I can put down Old Mettle.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I am here to be the ringmaster on behalf of Master Yanqing!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: As a representative of the Xianzhou Luofu, I will defeat all challengers!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's the spirit, sounds like you're all fired up! If you could just keep your legs from shaking so much, it would be more convincing, March.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I am here to ensure the safety of the Wardance!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That was the mission my grandfather entrusted to me. You just relax and keep guard over the ring.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: As the saying goes, "The disciple takes the toil of their master." Remember, you are here under the identity of a Luofu swordmaster, taking the place of your no-good Master Yanqing as the ringmaster.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: But what am I supposed to do if my opponent for this round is super talented and just wipes the floor with me in seconds? I'm still a beginner in swordplay! I don't know where I got the confidence when I agreed to help General Huaiyan.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Come on, there's no need to worry about that. If you are defeated, then your opponent shall have to answer to me! Although, if that happens, the honor and the glory of the Xianzhou Luofu shall all be taken by the Zhuming, hahaha...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli, please, I'm about to compete! Can you say something that will give me a little confidence?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: March. Think about the great storms that you Nameless of the Express have weathered along your many journeys. There's no doubt that you have faced far more terrifying enemies than your opponents here today, right? Don't you feel a lot more relaxed looking at it that way?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli, I think I should drop out of the contest.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: There's so much pressure, my stomach is really hurting. Maybe... I should just drop out of the contest?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: You made a promise to my grandfather and now you want to run away? Get out there, now!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Why don't we call Yanqing back?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Why don't we call Master Yanqing back? What kind of master would retire at the height of their career and leave their disciple to fight in their place?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: March. Your master has dropped out of the contest. This is a great opportunity for you to stick your neck out!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Stick my neck out and get my head chopped off, you mean!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: What is all of this complaining about? You made a promise to my grandfather and now you want to run away? Get out there, now!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Let's get going, then.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I've trained hard in the art of swordplay over these few days. It's time for me to get in the ring and prove myself. Let's go.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli, I don't think I'm completely ready...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: March, there is no such thing as completely ready.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: So this is the Skysplitter? It looked quite impressive from the ground where I was on duty, but...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: But now that I'm on board, it just doesn't seem as... big as I imagined?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Curious Spectator]: Oh? And how big did you imagine this "impressive Skysplitter" to be? This big? This big, maybe?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: Let me think... Hmm. I'd expect at least a four-hour journey by starskiff to the spectator seating from here. Otherwise it's simply not impressive enough!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Wouldn't that be too big for no good reason?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: The bigger, the better! If you ask me, the Skysplitter is nowhere near big enough and there are nowhere near enough cannons!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Curious Spectator]: This warship used to have loads of cannons.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: You're daydreaming about stuff that ain't gonna happen.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: What's wrong with that? People are supposed to dream big! If you ask me, the Skysplitter is far too small!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I kinda think this place is a bit cramped too.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: The Skysplitter looks small from a distance, but it's even smaller than I imagined now that I'm on board.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: Hear that? This person gets it!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: Either way, I thought that the Skysplitter would be absolutely huge, so it's not quite how I imagined it.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Curious Spectator]: Are we going or not?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Confused Spectator]: Seriously, the Skysplitter is nowhere near impressive enough!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sky-Faring Staff: Hello, is there anything I can help you with?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Hello, I have some questions I'd like to ask you!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...You have questions?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sky-Faring Staff: May I ask, are you an invited contestant, or are you a spectator?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I am a contestant!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sky-Faring Staff: Then may your blade be sharp and your victory glorious!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I'm just a spectator...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Hey! Are you trying to back out before you even hit the arena? Hello, we are both Wardance competitors.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sky-Faring Staff: Then please continue along this passageway. You will come to a security checkpoint, and the staff there will guide you to the contestants' hall.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sky-Faring Staff: Then please continue along this passageway. You will come to a security checkpoint, and the staff there will guide you to the contestants' hall.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Combat Rating Enthusiast]: You see these glasses I have on?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Combat Rating Enthusiast]: These Rating Glasses are a special souvenir I picked up from The Blue. If I just look at a contestant through them, they can give a combat power rating.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Take a look at me?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Take a look at me, then. What is my combat power rating?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Combat Rating Enthusiast]: ...Five.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Impossible! Take a closer look! Is it scored out of five or something?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Poor little March, being bullied by a mechanical scoring system... Don't pay them any mind, let's go!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: No-no-no! Don't look at me! If you see some embarrassingly low score, then I don't want to hear it!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: Miss Yunli, Miss March! This way, please.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: I was informed of your arrival by Madam Yukong and came to greet you personally.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: The news that you will be the ringmaster in place of Lieutenant Yanqing has been made public, Miss March. Just now, as I passed the contestants' hall, I overheard them all discussing this news. The most common question I heard was... "Who is March 7th?"
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: If they ask you this, how will you introduce yourself? Do you have something prepared?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: March 7th, young beauty of the Astral Express.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: March 7th, a young beauty from the Astral Express!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Alright! When people ask you, you might as well tell them this loud and clear.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: March 7th, Yanqing's disciple.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I am a disciple of Lieutenant Yanqing... That means that I'm also technically a grand-disciple of General Jing Yuan. When you put it like that, I'm actually a pretty big deal!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Ugh! You completely left my name out... How rude!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: March 7th, the invincible March 7th!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: March 7th, the invincible March 7th!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Next time you try to bluff like that, at least make it convincing.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Losers have no right to ask my name.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Hmph. Losers have no right to know my great name!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Is this some kind of villain entrance line?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: Hahaha, I see you are both quite relaxed! Impressive, given the imminent danger you face!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: Miss Yunli's contestant information was registered for the Wardance a long time ago. However, as a last-minute entry, the Sky-Faring Commission has taken care of the necessary procedures for you, Miss March 7th.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Xikui]: Please follow this path. The contestant hall is just up ahead.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Thank you, Miss Xikui.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Come, let's take a look around the contestant hall.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: So, this is the contestant hall.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: There are so many people!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: March, before the Wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: My grandfather always told me that "a weapon mimics its master." That means that a person's weapon will reflect their habits and personality.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: You've seen me wield Old Mettle before, haven't you? Tell me, what did you observe from that?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: That Master Yunli is very strong.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli's Old Mettle is taller than a person. Being able to wield a weapon like that must mean that you have ridiculous strength, right?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli has a fiery temperament.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Waving around such a giant weapon... Master Yunli favors using overwhelming force over strategy.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: You are not wrong. My battle style has always been "simple and effective" — one cut and it's over.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli doesn't have good taste.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. I don't think you have very good taste.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. No one asked you to criticize my dear Old Mettle!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Observing the weapon that your opponent uses, assessing what kind of battle skills they excel at and where their weaknesses lie is the key to victory in battle. A shockingly heavy sword like mine, for example, is obviously not suited for a long, drawn-out battle. So, it would be best to find a way to drag the battle out.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Why would you tell me your weakness?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's the only way to ensure that we have a fair fight, don't you think? I don't want to see you go and lose to someone else, after all.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Now is a perfect opportunity to learn how to evaluate your opponents. Let's use the people here in the contestants' hall to practice. If you know yourself and know your enemy, you will not lose in a hundred battles.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Know myself and know the enemy... Let's see, who should I ask first?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: There's no need to rush to the ring just yet, let's get to know your opponents around here first.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Animated Spectator]: I heard that a sword master from the Xianzhou Zhuming is going to challenge Lieutenant Yanqing at this Wardance. Who do you think will win in the fight? Can you give me your analysis?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Talkative Spectator]: Lieutenant Yanqing, obviously! His swordsmanship is on a whole other level! I was fortunate enough to see him in person using his Flying Swords to capture a criminal in Starskiff Haven. I reckon just a few swift strikes and...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Ahem!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Goodness! Isn't that the Xianzhou Zhuming's contestant, Miss Yunli?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Talkative Spectator]: ...Just a few swift strikes and the Zhuming swordmaster will have him on his knees!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Uh... Was there something you wanted to ask me?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Ah, yes... This is just a regular Cloud Knight devastator glaive.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Do you have any weaknesses?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: If I had to think of a weakness... Whenever I open my mouth, I make things awkward. Does that count as a weakness?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: I understand what's going on, Miss March 7th and Miss Yunli. I'm actually not a contestant. I'm just here as a security guard.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Ah, so... that was a little bit awkward.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: It's alright. I can't bear to watch other people make things awkward, so I always try to keep the conversation going, but then I'm the one who ends up making things awkward. I've gotten used to it by now, so don't worry.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess you could say it's all fair winds and calm "wolves."
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: ...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Another awkward pause, I knew it... Do you get it? "Wolves" sounds like "waves." It's a funny pun.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: He's actually explaining his joke!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Ah, making things awkward really is my weakness...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: There are still many guests arriving here. Please be cautious!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Understood!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: I am not a contestant Miss March. Please find someone else to talk to.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: ...I'm not used to wearing clothes like this at all...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Oh! You're March 7th, the stand-in for Lieutenant Yanqing, correct?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: That's right, and you are...?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: As you can see, I am the journalist entrusted with interviewing contestants on-site.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I see the Sky-Faring Commission has really gone all out as the host. Interesting...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: That's right! A big event like this just can't go ahead without a few of us running around. Since the competition is getting started, could I ask you some questions that are on my mind?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Of course.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Oh, great!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I'm actually just here to learn about my opponents...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Know yourself and know your enemy, right? If you accept my interview, you'll learn all about yourself!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: First, the question that is on everyone's minds! Lieutenant Yanqing is not appearing in today's Wardance!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: This is just gossip from unreliable sources, but I hear that Lieutenant Yanqing is seriously injured. Is this true?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: It's true!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: If that's the case, could you please tell me how these serious injuries came about?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: A traffic accident.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: You mean... a starskiff crash!? Why, how terrible!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: He was injured in training.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Swordplay is a truly difficult art!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: There was a plot against him.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: I—I had no idea it was that serious! That's a huge scoop! *ahem* I do not wish to offend you with this question but... This was not your doing, was it, Miss March?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Hmph, you saw right through me. Why else would I be standing here today?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: He wanted his disciple to have this opportunity.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Wait. Your master got himself seriously injured so he could withdraw from the competition and allow you to compete in his place? Wow, not many masters would show such devotion to their disciples.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: It's not true.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Then what is the real reason?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: He just doesn't want to compete.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: I never thought that such a talented young man that has garnered so much attention would have this kind of attitude!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: No comment.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Seriously? Ah, alright, I understand...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Relationship trouble.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Y—You're kidding!? That's a huge scoop!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: You yourself said that this was just gossip...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Ah, my apologies, this was very unprofessional of me. I see that Lieutenant Yanqing has his own affairs to tend to. Then let us look forward to seeing a valiant performance from you, Miss March!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Once the Wardance begins, you will be challenged by master swordsmen from many different worlds, Miss March 7th. Are there any that you are looking forward to facing in particular?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: There are.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: May I ask who that might be?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yanqing.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Ohhh! Of course it's the highly-anticipated Lieutenant Yanqing!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: The talented swordswoman from the Xianzhou Zhuming, Miss Yunli! I look forward to a spectacular battle between you two!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: General Feixiao.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: So March 7th is ignoring everyone around her and is declaring her will to challenge the Merlin's Claw of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sushang.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: S—Sushang...? Who is that? I feel like that's a name I've seen a lot online recently...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: .
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Uhh, who? Are you... talking about a contestant here today?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: No.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: March 7th, you are quite arro—... I mean, extremely self-assured!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Thank you very much for accepting my interview. Much appreciated!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Thank you very much for accepting my interview. Much appreciated!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: Argh! I came here because I wanted to meet the great Lieutenant Yanqing I've heard so much about and finally cross blades with him myself!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: Who would have imagined that he would take a disciple and have her be the ringmaster in his place? This is no more than running away from a fight and is a great dishonor to the Yaoqing!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: This last-minute replacement, March 7th, who exactly is she?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The contestant from the Yaoqing, aside from the longsword on the back, also carried an electromagnetic hand crossbow.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: 
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: Hello, Miss. Are you here to take part in the Ringmaster's Challenge, too?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Hello, I am March 7th.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: That's right. I'm the March 7th that everyone's been talking about.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: What!? You're March 7th!?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Don't worry, I'm a newbie swordmaster who's only been practicing the art of swordplay for half a month.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: March 7th... Standing before you is a seasoned Cloud Knight who has practiced swordsmanship for over two hundred years!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: 
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: She's just a little girl that has only just started training... Why was she chosen as a contestant?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: The first round of the Wardance is about to begin. Are you feeling okay, March?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Me? I'm fine. As soon as I saw all these people gathered here, I suddenly felt weirdly relaxed.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: These contestants all seem very reliable.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Looking at these contestants, I suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I don't... really feel anything special?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Just make sure to maintain this composure when you go in the ring.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I understand why you wanted me to "know myself and know my enemy." I don't feel as nervous as I did before!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...So, do you want to go out and see the ring?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I want to keep learning about my opponents!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...Very well, go and get your intel.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I want to see what the ring looks like!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I knew it. Let's go.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Diting]: Woof woof, woof woof woof woof?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Uhh... You're even asking Diting?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Diting]: Woof woof woof woof, woof woof woof.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Ah, it's saying "I'm not a contestant." Got it.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Woof woof, woof woof woof woof woof?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Diting]: Woof woof.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Looks like she's done with her questions...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's enough knowing the enemy for now. Come on, I want to see what the ring looks like.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Maybe it's because she spends so much time with  that March 7th has the urge to interrogate the bench.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: But March 7th isn't , and her mental condition isn't... that bad.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Hmm...If there's anything you want to ask, hurry up or March 7th's rationality will come back.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Did any skilled competitors show up?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The bench remains silent, having witnessed the presence of many a formidable figure, including the once-renowned Sword Champion of the Luofu.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: March 7th tries very hard to contain her urge to talk to the bench and nods at Yunli.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The bench gazes at March 7th's back, leaving behind a drop of sweat.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's enough knowing the enemy for now. Come on, I want to see what the ring looks like.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: If we walk through here, we'll be able to see the Wardance's official venue.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Wow! So this is what it's like from the spectator seats?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Look over there, that's the ring we'll be standing on.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli, I—I'm getting nervous again! Can I really do this?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: It's too late for nerves now. It's almost time!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Almost time for what?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: As soon as I think about the mission General Huaiyan gave me, my heart starts racing like crazy! What do I do, Master Yunli?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: It's when it stops beating that we need to worry. Just take in the atmosphere and prepare yourself.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I have to leave for a moment and do some inspections around the ship. This was also part of grandpa's orders.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I wonder how Master Yanqing is doing over there...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Hey, focus!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Come, let's take a look around the contestant hall.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: So, this is the contestant hall.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: There are so many people!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: March, before the Wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: My grandfather always told me that "a weapon mimics its master." That means that a person's weapon will reflect their habits and personality.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: You've seen me wield Old Mettle before, haven't you? Tell me, what did you observe from that?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: That Master Yunli is very strong.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli's Old Mettle is taller than a person. Being able to wield a weapon like that must mean that you have ridiculous strength, right?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli has a fiery temperament.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Waving around such a giant weapon... Master Yunli favors using overwhelming force over strategy.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: You are not wrong. My battle style has always been "simple and effective" — one cut and it's over.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli doesn't have good taste.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. I don't think you have very good taste.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. No one asked you to criticize my dear Old Mettle!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Observing the weapon that your opponent uses, assessing what kind of battle skills they excel at and where their weaknesses lie is the key to victory in battle. A shockingly heavy sword like mine, for example, is obviously not suited for a long, drawn-out battle. So, it would be best to find a way to drag the battle out.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Why would you tell me your weakness?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's the only way to ensure that we have a fair fight, don't you think? I don't want to see you go and lose to someone else, after all.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Now is a perfect opportunity to learn how to evaluate your opponents. Let's use the people here in the contestants' hall to practice. If you know yourself and know your enemy, you will not lose in a hundred battles.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Know myself and know the enemy... Let's see, who should I ask first?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: There's no need to rush to the ring just yet, let's get to know your opponents around here first.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Animated Spectator]: I heard that a sword master from the Xianzhou Zhuming is going to challenge Lieutenant Yanqing at this Wardance. Who do you think will win in the fight? Can you give me your analysis?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Talkative Spectator]: Lieutenant Yanqing, obviously! His swordsmanship is on a whole other level! I was fortunate enough to see him in person using his Flying Swords to capture a criminal in Starskiff Haven. I reckon just a few swift strikes and...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Ahem!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Goodness! Isn't that the Xianzhou Zhuming's contestant, Miss Yunli?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Talkative Spectator]: ...Just a few swift strikes and the Zhuming swordmaster will have him on his knees!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Uh... Was there something you wanted to ask me?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Ah, yes... This is just a regular Cloud Knight devastator glaive.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Do you have any weaknesses?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: If I had to think of a weakness... Whenever I open my mouth, I make things awkward. Does that count as a weakness?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: I understand what's going on, Miss March 7th and Miss Yunli. I'm actually not a contestant. I'm just here as a security guard.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Ah, so... that was a little bit awkward.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: It's alright. I can't bear to watch other people make things awkward, so I always try to keep the conversation going, but then I'm the one who ends up making things awkward. I've gotten used to it by now, so don't worry.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess you could say it's all fair winds and calm "wolves."
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: ...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Another awkward pause, I knew it... Do you get it? "Wolves" sounds like "waves." It's a funny pun.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: He's actually explaining his joke!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Ah, making things awkward really is my weakness...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: There are still many guests arriving here. Please be cautious!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: Understood!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Soldier on Duty]: I am not a contestant Miss March. Please find someone else to talk to.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: ...I'm not used to wearing clothes like this at all...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Oh! You're March 7th, the stand-in for Lieutenant Yanqing, correct?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: That's right, and you are...?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: As you can see, I am the journalist entrusted with interviewing contestants on-site.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I see the Sky-Faring Commission has really gone all out as the host. Interesting...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: That's right! A big event like this just can't go ahead without a few of us running around. Since the competition is getting started, could I ask you some questions that are on my mind?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Of course.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Oh, great!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I'm actually just here to learn about my opponents...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Know yourself and know your enemy, right? If you accept my interview, you'll learn all about yourself!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: First, the question that is on everyone's minds! Lieutenant Yanqing is not appearing in today's Wardance!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: This is just gossip from unreliable sources, but I hear that Lieutenant Yanqing is seriously injured. Is this true?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: It's true!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: If that's the case, could you please tell me how these serious injuries came about?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: A traffic accident.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: You mean... a starskiff crash!? Why, how terrible!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: He was injured in training.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Swordplay is a truly difficult art!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: There was a plot against him.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: I—I had no idea it was that serious! That's a huge scoop! *ahem* I do not wish to offend you with this question but... This was not your doing, was it, Miss March?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Hmph, you saw right through me. Why else would I be standing here today?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: He wanted his disciple to have this opportunity.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Wait. Your master got himself seriously injured so he could withdraw from the competition and allow you to compete in his place? Wow, not many masters would show such devotion to their disciples.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: It's not true.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Then what is the real reason?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: He just doesn't want to compete.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: I never thought that such a talented young man that has garnered so much attention would have this kind of attitude!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: No comment.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Seriously? Ah, alright, I understand...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Relationship trouble.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Y—You're kidding!? That's a huge scoop!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: You yourself said that this was just gossip...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Ah, my apologies, this was very unprofessional of me. I see that Lieutenant Yanqing has his own affairs to tend to. Then let us look forward to seeing a valiant performance from you, Miss March!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Once the Wardance begins, you will be challenged by master swordsmen from many different worlds, Miss March 7th. Are there any that you are looking forward to facing in particular?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: There are.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: May I ask who that might be?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yanqing.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Ohhh! Of course it's the highly-anticipated Lieutenant Yanqing!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Master Yunli.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: The talented swordswoman from the Xianzhou Zhuming, Miss Yunli! I look forward to a spectacular battle between you two!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: General Feixiao.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: So March 7th is ignoring everyone around her and is declaring her will to challenge the Merlin's Claw of the Xianzhou Yaoqing.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Sushang.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: S—Sushang...? Who is that? I feel like that's a name I've seen a lot online recently...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: .
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Uhh, who? Are you... talking about a contestant here today?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: No.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: March 7th, you are quite arro—... I mean, extremely self-assured!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Thank you very much for accepting my interview. Much appreciated!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Reporter]: Thank you very much for accepting my interview. Much appreciated!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: Argh! I came here because I wanted to meet the great Lieutenant Yanqing I've heard so much about and finally cross blades with him myself!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: Who would have imagined that he would take a disciple and have her be the ringmaster in his place? This is no more than running away from a fight and is a great dishonor to the Yaoqing!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: This last-minute replacement, March 7th, who exactly is she?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The contestant from the Yaoqing, aside from the longsword on the back, also carried an electromagnetic hand crossbow.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: 
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: Hello, Miss. Are you here to take part in the Ringmaster's Challenge, too?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Hello, I am March 7th.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: That's right. I'm the March 7th that everyone's been talking about.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: What!? You're March 7th!?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Don't worry, I'm a newbie swordmaster who's only been practicing the art of swordplay for half a month.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: March 7th... Standing before you is a seasoned Cloud Knight who has practiced swordsmanship for over two hundred years!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: 
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yaoqing Contestant]: She's just a little girl that has only just started training... Why was she chosen as a contestant?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: The first round of the Wardance is about to begin. Are you feeling okay, March?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Me? I'm fine. As soon as I saw all these people gathered here, I suddenly felt weirdly relaxed.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: These contestants all seem very reliable.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Looking at these contestants, I suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I don't... really feel anything special?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Just make sure to maintain this composure when you go in the ring.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I understand why you wanted me to "know myself and know my enemy." I don't feel as nervous as I did before!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...So, do you want to go out and see the ring?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I want to keep learning about my opponents!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: ...Very well, go and get your intel.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: I want to see what the ring looks like!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I knew it. Let's go.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Diting]: Woof woof, woof woof woof woof?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Uhh... You're even asking Diting?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Diting]: Woof woof woof woof, woof woof woof.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Ah, it's saying "I'm not a contestant." Got it.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Woof woof, woof woof woof woof woof?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Diting]: Woof woof.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Looks like she's done with her questions...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's enough knowing the enemy for now. Come on, I want to see what the ring looks like.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Maybe it's because she spends so much time with  that March 7th has the urge to interrogate the bench.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: But March 7th isn't , and her mental condition isn't... that bad.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Hmm...If there's anything you want to ask, hurry up or March 7th's rationality will come back.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Did any skilled competitors show up?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The bench remains silent, having witnessed the presence of many a formidable figure, including the once-renowned Sword Champion of the Luofu.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: March 7th tries very hard to contain her urge to talk to the bench and nods at Yunli.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: The bench gazes at March 7th's back, leaving behind a drop of sweat.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: That's enough knowing the enemy for now. Come on, I want to see what the ring looks like.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: If we walk through here, we'll be able to see the Wardance's official venue.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Wow! So this is what it's like from the spectator seats?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Look over there, that's the ring we'll be standing on.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli, I—I'm getting nervous again! Can I really do this?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: It's too late for nerves now. It's almost time!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Almost time for what?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: As soon as I think about the mission General Huaiyan gave me, my heart starts racing like crazy! What do I do, Master Yunli?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: It's when it stops beating that we need to worry. Just take in the atmosphere and prepare yourself.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I have to leave for a moment and do some inspections around the ship. This was also part of grandpa's orders.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I wonder how Master Yanqing is doing over there...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Hey, focus!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: If we walk through here, we'll be able to see the Wardance's official venue.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Wow! So this is what it's like from the spectator seats?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Look over there, that's the ring we'll be standing on.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Master Yunli, I—I'm getting nervous again! Can I really do this?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: It's too late for nerves now. It's almost time!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: Almost time for what?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: As soon as I think about the mission General Huaiyan gave me, my heart starts racing like crazy! What do I do, Master Yunli?
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: It's when it stops beating that we need to worry. Just take in the atmosphere and prepare yourself.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: I have to leave for a moment and do some inspections around the ship. This was also part of grandpa's orders.
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][March 7th]: I wonder how Master Yanqing is doing over there...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Yunli]: Hey, focus!
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Novice in Zenithal Duel][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[A Swarm of Carnage][Cloud Knight Soldier]: General, report! The teams are in position, and the Sky-Faring Commission has taken control of the starskiff lanes.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Activate all cycranes and have them scan everyone coming in and out of the port.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Remain vigilant at all times. Any suspicious movements must be suppressed as quickly as possible before the situation gets out of hand.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Cloud Knight Soldier]: Yes, general!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: :
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Yanqing, , follow me.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Moze's signal is nearby, but we lost contact just a moment ago...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: Could that mean...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: He will be fine. Cloud Knights, search for the target!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: ...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: All of you, get out of my way...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: It's Moze...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: General, look there...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Wait, don't go any closer.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: General... I failed you. That mad dog left me here as...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: A declaration of war.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Unfriendly Foxian]: That's right. I have been holding back the urge to slit his throat all this time. Well, Lord Hoolay ordered us to remain here, just to see...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Unfriendly Foxian]: ...if you, the great Merlin's Claw, mortal enemy of the borisin, are able to join him in a little... hunting game...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Hunting is not a game, it is a battle of life and death. Are you ready for your death, abomination!?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Borisin]: Die, you lowly beast! Die!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: Save your breath!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Borisin]: Don't think you've won...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Borisin]: The Warhead has prepared... a road of no return for all of you...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Moze, are you okay?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: I... wasn't able to save Jiaoqiu. Hoolay was more cunning and powerful than I imagined...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Tell me, how is he planning to declare this war against me...? With a one-on-one duel? Or with a hostage exchange, maybe?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: Hoolay is planning on attacking the bustling streets of the Xianzhou Luofu.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: What did you just say?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: Impossible! Even if there are still undercover borisin that we haven't sniffed out, Hoolay can't have more than a few dozen people. How is he planning on simultaneously attacking the streets of the Xianzhou Luofu?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: He has an ace up his sleeve. Hoolay's body holds a plaguemark passed down through generations of borisin. I've seen him convert a foxian to a borisin wolftrooper with my own eyes...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: This is Hoolay's "declaration of war." His blood... It can cause foxians to rapidly transform and lose their minds. He has passed his blood to his minions and is planning to spread it across the Luofu and stir up panic!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: You're saying that there will be attacks all over?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: He wants to "encircle" us in one fell swoop... This beast is truly unpredictable.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: Evacuate all the foxians immediately!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: Contact the Sky-Faring Commission and the Cloud Knights right away! Have them enforce a traffic ban and order all foxians to remain indoors until further notice!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: The moment you see your enemy's declaration of war, it means that they have already begun to take action.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Moze]: But... if Hoolay succeeds in getting this panic to spread—
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Do you remember what I told you before? Hunting is about thinking in the same way as your prey, not just mindlessly chasing after them.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: What Hoolay wants is to see everyone on the Luofu descend into panic. He wants to see us lose our minds and waste our limited manpower scouring every inch of the Luofu for signs of an attack until we exhaust ourselves.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: It's like that party game that the people of the Yaoqing love to play: They hide an object under one of several bowls, then move the bowls around, and have you guess which one the object is underneath.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: The way I see it, this is all nothing more than misdirection...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: No matter what Hoolay does, there is one truth that cannot be changed: He is trapped aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. The only way for him to escape is to find a ship.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: And the only ship he is able to see is...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: So his only option is the Skysplitter?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: : Right now... the only ship he'd be able to see is the Skysplitter.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: In his eyes, that ship is full of countless hostages. That would be the best place for him to go. So that will also be our final battlefield.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: But, if we're wrong about this... If he goes somewhere else, or if he does as he said he would, and his minions infect the foxians everywhere with wolf blood... What do we do then?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: Are we just supposed to abandon those "less likely" locations?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: This is another lesson that you must learn outside of swordplay: Weighing your options and making a decision. There are always questions that we will ask ourselves but never be able to answer.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Before making a decision, we must destroy any hesitation that we are holding onto. Once we make a decision, we must fight off any regrets.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: There is a chance that we will make the wrong decision and allow our allies to be sacrificed in vain. There is a chance that we will predict our enemy's movements correctly, yet underestimate their strength and be overwhelmed in battle...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: But being lost in hesitation and failing to take any action will always be more harmful than taking the wrong path. We must make a decision, no matter what.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Everyone, listen up. I will personally take charge of Starskiff Haven, evacuate the people, and prepare for any possible attacks. I will do my best to ensure that things are safe on the ground.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: :
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: , please lend us your strength as you did when the Ambrosial Arbor was reborn. I need you and Moze to go in search of Jiaoqiu.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: Leave it to me!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: General, please entrust me with the safety of the Skysplitter! I was originally meant to participate in the tournament, so now it is only right that I return to the Skysplitter.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: If Hoolay does come to attack the Skysplitter... Lieutenant Yanqing, I need you to hold him there until I am able to arrive.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Yanqing]: Please rest assured, General. If he dares step foot on the Skysplitter, I, Yanqing, swear on the blade in my hands that he shall not escape!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: As the Cloud Knights set off to various locations, they swiftly began to cordon off areas and start inspections.At that time, the Cloud Knights are waiting in formation in the Exalting Sanctum...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Cloud Knights! The borisin have arrogantly decided to challenge us on Xianzhou territory! They vow that they will unleash a bloodbath along the streets of the Xianzhou.
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: The unarmed civilians of the Xianzhou and countless visitors from afar are under our protection. Let me ask you, as Cloud Knights, will we allow the borisin to succeed with their plan!?
[A Swarm of Carnage][Cloud Knight]: Never!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Be on your guard!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Calling Starskiff Haven. Have all Cloud Knights be on full alert for borisin attacks!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: Yukong's Communicator: Feixiao, the ports of Starskiff Haven are crawling with wolf-like creatures. They're moving fast—
[A Swarm of Carnage][Feixiao]: Hold them back, I will be there immediately!
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: Switching to Feixiao's POV...
[A Swarm of Carnage][Narration]: "Surround three and leave one." The Merlin's Claw initiates the hunt against the pack of wolves...

[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Yukong]: There you are, Feixiao!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: Madam Yukong! After thirty years, we find ourselves fighting side-by-side once more!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: It's been a while since I've let loose. Let's get this started!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Yukong]: Remember you are still on the Luofu. Try not to go too wild!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: We have cleared out the enemies in Starskiff Haven.
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Yukong]: But it seems that there are fierce battles being waged at both the Exalting Sanctum and Aurum Alley. I will prepare a starskiff—
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: We cannot allow the fighting to continue. This is now a race against time to stop this farce that Hoolay has created.
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: I know Jiaoqiu always wants me to know my limits and not get carried away, but... now is the time to bring this to a swift end.
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: Contact the Exalting Sanctum. Tell them, if they see a light in the sky, all units are to retreat immediately!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Feixiao]: Madam Yukong, lend me your bow!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Narration]: : ...What's that?
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Moze]: Everyone, out of the way!
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Sweep by Merlin's Claw][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: At the same time, in the Aurum AlleyFeixiao's skyborne wind arrows accurately find their mark in the borisin...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: Tsk, what a mess. I just knew it would end up this way...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: Every time she hits the battlefield she makes a mess like this.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: She didn't even leave a single survivor to get intel from. One of these men must have known about Hoolay and Jiaoqiu's whereabouts.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: What happened just now?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: That was one of Feixiao's "arrows." Who knows what she used as an arrow to fire all the way over here.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: That general of yours is way out of line!
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: She... She's just very passionate. She sees every place as a battlefield where she can unleash hell.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: Has that general of yours always been like this?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: I wouldn't say "always"... But "often" would be fair. As soon as the heat of battle gets to her, she sees every place as a battlefield where she can unleash hell.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: I want to see her fire another arrow with my own eyes...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: Moze sizes you up with a cold, indifferent gaze. You can almost hear the unspoken words in his expressionless face: "Is it not better to cherish your life instead?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: Is Jiaoqiu still alive...?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: ...He has to be.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: A retainer like myself is nothing more than an insignificant shadow who stands by the general's side. But Jiaoqiu is different. Without his careful treatment, the general wouldn't even be here today.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: Hopefully, he can use that silver tongue of his to buy himself enough time...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: , take a good look around. If you can find one or two borisin that aren't dead yet, let me know.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: I don't care how tight their lips are sealed. I always have a way to crack them open and get the information we need.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: ...What a terrifying attack.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: Who could have imagined... that such astonishing strength would lie in the hands of a foxian war slave...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: So decisive, so... brutal. She is more like a descendant of Duran than we who have fallen to our current state. No wonder the Warhead has his eyes on her.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: That's...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: The sneak that infiltrated The Shackling Prison. Mok Tok... You are harder to kill than a cockroach.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: The fact that you still draw breath after an attack like that...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: I remember you, Mok Tok... You are harder to kill than a cockroach.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: But, the fact that you have willingly shown yourself saves us some time.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: It is not too late for you to surrender. Tell me... where are Hoolay and Jiaoqiu?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: Save your energy, Yaoqing monkey. If there is one principle that we beasts know well, it is that we might have to break off an arm to break free from a cage. Today, I will be that arm.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: I lived as a hunter for many years, yet I have only followed the Warhead for this recent, brief period. However, his existence has brought light back to our once-blind eyes, like the moon of Verdantia. He has shown me the way.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: The descendants of Duran have abandoned the Wolf's Creed. In order to ensure our survival, we took solace in the shadows and fed on one another. We were no longer wolves. We were no more than rats, living a dirty and pathetic life.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: Thanks to the gift granted to us by Lord Hoolay, I have shared his vision and his blood... The descendants of Duran should live for the victory of the pack, and they should die for it as well!
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: Come, Yaoqing man. Show me your fangs! We will fight to the death!
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: How honorable, you mangy dog.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: But you seem to have misunderstood. There will be no fair one-on-one duel. Let's see how tough you are once we've put you down.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: The Warhead's blood... It boils in my veins...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: Long live Hoolay! The borisin resurgence is at hand!
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: The borisin resurgence?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: You think you can still pillage and murder freely as you did a thousand years before?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: The Xianzhou Yaoqing will ensure that this is nothing more than your dying fantasy!
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: Fight me! You think a scrape like this will send me running!?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: I must... hold on...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Mok Tok]: The borisin resurgence... shall come...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: No matter how heroic your sacrifice... there is no honor in your battles or deaths, borisin.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: It seems that Mok Tok got what he wished for.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: Hoolay... your "declaration of war" is over.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Moze]: From now on, no matter where you run, General Feixiao will catch you and send you to the same fate as Mok Tok...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: Your tongue is sharper than your claws.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: Don't stand in my way, child. Have your general speak with me. Our little hunting game is not over yet.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Feixiao]: Stand down, Moze. I am here, Hoolay. What do you wish to say?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: The Merlin's Claw, though we have never met on the battlefield, I have heard many interesting things about you from both my men and your healer.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: The people of the Xianzhou must be quite brave to allow a foxian war slave with borisin blood to ascend to the position of general.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: Has no one ever questioned that lineage of yours? Or could it be that your grand achievements were enough to convince everyone to keep their lips sealed?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Feixiao]: Claiming to have family ties with the enemy sounds to me like an attempt at asking for mercy... Hoolay, are you begging me for mercy?
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: I see that it is not only the ruthless blood of a wolf that courses through your veins, but also the cunning blood of a fox.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: When you think about it, this was a gift from the borisin. Anything that we gift, we are also free to reclaim...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: The Merlin's Claw, I shall extend a final invitation to you: I will be waiting for you on the Skysplitter.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: Before you arrive, I will slaughter all in sight, allowing the Crimson Moon that has fallen dim for over seven hundred years to once more come to life. I will illuminate this ship with the sheen of blood and show everyone just how weak and powerless the Xianzhou is.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: Then, I will pilot this ship through every blockade and barrier you have prepared and begin my journey home. This ship shall be the flagship for the borisin resurgence!
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Hoolay]: Before I finish these tasks of mine, you have a chance to stop me, or die at my hands. This is the path that I have prepared for you.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Feixiao]: I accept your challenge, Hoolay. Because the very moment you stepped aboard the Skysplitter, you stepped onto your path to ruin.
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: Switching to Yunli's POV...
[Last Stand of a Lone Wolf][Narration]: On the Skysplitter, the atmosphere of an impending storm makes Yunli anxious and uneasy...

[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: The Wardance is about to commenceSkysplitter
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: I'm entrusting you not only with the honor of the ring, but also with the security of the Skysplitter.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: That's easy for my grandfather to say, but this mission doesn't seem so simple anymore.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: The first round of the tournament is about to begin... I wonder how Yanqing and the others are doing?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: According to the plan, I should seek out the Cloud Knight soldiers aboard the Skysplitter and see if they've discovered anything.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Maybe I should take a moment to meet with March before the tournament starts?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: March is in the contestant's lounge right now. I wonder how her preparations are coming along...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: March, it's me, Yunli. Are you okay?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][March 7th]: Aghhhhhhhh...!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][March 7th]: Ooh, ow-ow-owww. Just a moment, I'm coming!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Ah... She's still a nervous wreck.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: You still seem nervous.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][March 7th]: I wasn't this nervous before... It's just being alone in this lounge, I can't stop thinking about everything. I mean, not only are we taking part in the Wardance, but we have such an important mission to carry out as well...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: March, calm down.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: Don't worry about your mission. I am here to help you.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Don't worry about your mission. You have me here too, right? I know my grandfather said that you must "represent the Luofu as the ringmaster," but don't let that intimidate you.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Ask yourself: You are a Nameless of the Astral Express. You have always been free to come and go as you please. So, why did you board the Skysplitter with me when my grandfather gave us this mission?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][March 7th]: Why...? Because I also want the Wardance to go smoothly.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][March 7th]: For us Nameless, even though we're just visitors at every stop... It was here that I met my two masters and made many new friends. I want the Wardance to go ahead without any problems, for everyone's sake.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Good answer! The tournament is about to begin, so I must go carry out the mission that Grandpa gave me.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: March, may your blade be sharp and your victory glorious.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][March 7th]: ...Thank you, Master Yunli.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: According to Grandpa's plan, I should seek out the Cloud Knight soldiers aboard the Skysplitter and see if there've been any new developments...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: It took enough time to calm her nerves, it's best I don't disturb her again now.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: Is that you, Miss Yunli? If there is anything that I can help you with, please let me know.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: How are the Cloud Knights doing?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: The Cloud Knights are all in position, following General Huaiyan's orders.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: Have you noticed any "wolves"?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: We haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary yet.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Very good. Although, there is one thing I want to confirm with you...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: Do you have a way of identifying borisin?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: Unfortunately, we don't have any means to distinguish between borisin and foxians.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: However, you can rest assured that the Cloud Knights are working hard to investigate the source of the forged identities...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: Tell me about how the Cloud Knights are currently deployed.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: All Cloud Knights on the Skysplitter have their own responsibilities and wouldn't dare neglect their posts.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: March 7th and I could already tell. It's clear that every Cloud Knight soldier we've met on the Skysplitter is an elite warrior.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: I would like to confirm if there have been any irregularities in boarding.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: Your timing is perfect, Miss Yunli. We actually just received an emergency boarding request.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: An emergency boarding request?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: It wasn't on the Skysplitter starskiff registry, but all the documentation checked out.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Who would be boarding the ship at this time? Where are they? I'll go check it out.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Soldier on Duty]: The starskiff is using the contestant docking bay. Would you like me to lead the way?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: No need. You have your own duties to take care of. I'll be fine by myself.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: 
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: 
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Routine inspection! All passengers please prepare for an inspection.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: 
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: I'm going to count down from ten. If you do not come out, I will destroy the ship.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Ten!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four... Time is running out!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Three! Two!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: One!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][???]: Wait a second!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: It's me.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: It's just a routine inspection. You weren't actually going to blow up the ship, were you? Is that also some kind of Zhuming custom...?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: What are you doing back here!?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: You're not a borisin in disguise, are you?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: Wait! Even though the borisin can disguise themselves, they can't turn into someone as short as me! Put your sword away.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Didn't little Yanqing claim he was going to give up being the ringmaster and go on the hunt instead? Help shoulder the general's burdens?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: The borisin on the ground suddenly launched an attack. General Feixiao was concerned that this was all a diversion by Hoolay, so I requested to come to the Skysplitter and provide support.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: I can't believe you ended up back here on the Skysplitter after running around all over the place. But, you're too late to enter the tournament now.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Following Grandpa's plan, our disciple March is taking your place as ringmaster... Aren't you proud of her?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: When I first heard the news, I was definitely proud, but also a little concerned...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: More manpower is always a good thing, since the Skysplitter is so large. Oh, and by the way, you should know that—
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: What's happening!?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Does it feel like the Skysplitter has slowed down? Could it be...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Come with me, we need to check the engine room! It's the heart of the ship, so we need to prioritize its safety!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][System Broadcaster]: The Wardance is about to begin. Contestants, please make your way to the arena.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: The engine room is just up ahead. Let's go.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Strange, why is there no one here?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: The Cloud Knights... They're over here.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][???]: And you should be lying alongside them...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Disguised Foxian]: Don't worry, children, there's plenty of space to hide your bodies over here.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: Even though I truly hoped that the Wardance would go ahead uninterrupted and that I was worrying for no reason...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Now that these guys have finally shown up, it's a huge weight off my mind. Bring it on, you abominations!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yanqing]: If we found two wolves in the engine room, that means that even more abominations have infiltrated other areas... Hoolay is already aboard the Skysplitter!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: There's no time to talk about this. The Wardance has already started! If my guess is correct, the borisin will most likely use the ceremony to begin their slaughter.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Let's go. We need to get to the Wardance ring!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: Come with me! To the ring!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Yunli]: This way, we're not too late!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Tournament Commentator]: We would like to welcome all of our honored guests and contestants... to the Xianzhou Luofu's Luminary Wardance ceremony!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Tournament Commentator]: We would like to welcome all of our honored guests and contestants... to the Xianzhou Luofu's Luminary Wardance ceremony!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Tournament Commentator]: Before we get the first round under way, our organizing committee would like to introduce you all to a host known throughout the cosmos — Mr. Owlbert! He is here today as our special guest host!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Spectators]: *cheering*
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Tournament Commentator]: Let us invite our special guest host, Mr. Owlbert, to the stage to formally open the Wardance—
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Hoolay]: Your Wardance ends here!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Hoolay]: From this moment on, the Skysplitter belongs to me. And for you, dear spectators, I have prepared a true fight to the death!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Hoolay]: Now, run for your lives!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Tournament Commentator]: My apologies! The spectators that you were expecting aren't here... Everyone here actually came to see you.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Tournament Commentator]: Cloud Knights, prepare for battle!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Voices from all around]: Xianzhou soars, Cloud Knight roars! Xianzhou soars, Cloud Knight roars! Xianzhou soars, Cloud Knight roars!...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Hoolay]: ...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Hoolay]: I see you were ready for me.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Borisin around the stadium]: *echoing the howl of the Warhead*
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Hoolay]: That's fine too! Since you have all prepared for your deaths, come, give me all you've got — entertain me!
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: Three dual-hours before the Wardance convenesSeat of Divine Foresight.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Huaiyan]: Surround your enemy, but leave one side open... This is your strategy for ensuring that the Wardance will be able to be held as usual?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: Precisely. When Hoolay escaped, we should have canceled the Wardance immediately. No one can predict where a wild beast like him will attack, yet festivals and celebrations like this are likely to become targets.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: However, preparations for the Wardance were in the works for so long, I couldn't bear to announce its cancellation. So, I thought, if the show must go on, then let it go on. But that doesn't mean that the Wardance we hold today has to be the real event.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: All we need to do is swap all the spectators and contestants aboard the ship with Cloud Knight soldiers, and the Skysplitter, soaring high above, will become the ultimate battleground for our hunt.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Huaiyan]: ...But what do we do if Hoolay is not planning to attack the Wardance?
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: Then we just need to draw his attention to the Skysplitter. We'll have the Sky-Faring Commission clear all transport lanes and cut down starskiff traffic. Then, when the time comes, there will be only one ship in the sky, and he will have no reason not to attack.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: General Feixiao will be in charge of scaring the wolves and cutting off their other means of escape, making him think that this will be his best way out.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: Given that the borisin already have insiders on the Luofu, I will be in charge of putting pressure on them, making them focus solely on keeping themselves safe.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Huaiyan]: Very good! Then I'd better dust off my weary bones, too! I will go with the Sky-Faring Commission to guard the Jade Gate and ensure that things do not spiral out of control.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: Knowing that Elder Huaiyan is part of our last line of defense is a great comfort.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Jing Yuan]: This hunt will make Hoolay understand that the arrows of The Hunt will always be one step ahead of the abominations.
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: Switching to March 7th's POV...
[I Shall Turn the Tide][Narration]: March 7th senses the signs of impending danger — the moment to test her swordplay has finally arrived...

[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: That jolt just now... what's going on? It feels like the entire ship has started to slow down?
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: Borisin must have actually infiltrated the Skysplitter. Based on General Huaiyan's orders... it's time for me to take action.
[Comrade in Arms][Ferocious Wolftrooper]: *roaring*!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: You guys... you're not Cloud Knights acting as borisin, are you?
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: You're... you're real borisin, aren't you?
[Comrade in Arms][Ferocious Wolftrooper]: *roaring*!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: It looks like the general's arrangements are finally coming in handy... I need to find Yunli and the others as soon as possible.
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: The plan said that if Hoolay appears, the Cloud Knights will assemble and do everything they can to suppress him.
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: Master Yunli, where are you?
[Comrade in Arms][Yunli]: March, I'm below the ring!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: The hall below the ring... I remember it being this way...
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: ...Master Yanqing, what are you doing here?
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: I was concerned about the safety of the Skysplitter and my dear disciple, of course!
[Comrade in Arms][Yunli]: Yanqing, the wolf you are hunting is standing above us in the Wardance ring at this very moment, facing the Cloud Knights...
[Comrade in Arms][Yunli]: This "Wardance" will not be seen by the people of the Xianzhou, nor will it be just a ceremonial sword fight. This is a battle to the death that offers no honor, only mortal danger. March, are you ready?
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: I am March 7th.
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: Please, I am March 7th, a swordmaster who will represent the Luofu in glorious battle!
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: I am your disciple.
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: If my masters are going to battle, how could they go without their disciple?
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: Well, since I'm already here!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: To use General Jing Yuan's favorite expression: "Since I'm already here..."
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: Yunli, Miss March, may your blades be sharp and your victories glorious!
[Comrade in Arms][Yunli]: May your blades be sharp and your victories glorious!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: May your blades... Ah forget it. Let's go and make this a quick victory!
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: Let's go!
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: The Wardance "Wolfhunt Showdown" starts now!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: So feeble! Such weakness is truly pathetic!
[Comrade in Arms][Yunli]: I've been waiting a long time for this, Hoolay!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: I see Feixiao has sent some young cubs to the slaughter...
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: Remember this! My name is March 7th! Ringmaster of the Luofu!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Does the Xianzhou Luofu not have any worthy warriors?
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: I wouldn't let my guard down if I were you. It's about time this old wolf tasted defeat at the hands of a young cub!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: You think a little ambush is enough to defeat me?
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: I will make you understand just how wrong you are!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: Such insane power...
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Fine. You can be a little opening act for me until Feixiao finally arrives!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Swing with all your might, dear cubs!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: You thought I would run? A wolf's path only goes forward. Running is never an option!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Why is Feixiao still not here? I grow bored of these cubs!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: If this goes on, they'll all be dead by the time she arrives!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Not bad! But it will take much more than that!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Your feeble weapons are like blades of grass before my unbreakable body!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: I've had enough... Time to finish this little game!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: ...What's happening?
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: Not long ago...
[Comrade in Arms][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance Comrade in Arms.mp4
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Secrets are a weapon that a hunter cannot live without. Those that have no secrets are no more than prey, cut open and waiting for death.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: What you're saying is, in your eyes, I am no more than prey that has exhausted all of its secrets and is simply awaiting its death?
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Do you think you have some other escape route? Jiaoqiu, I have already peeled back your disguises and defenses layer by layer. I know all the secrets that you and your general have buried so deep.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: But you have told me all of your secrets too, Warhead.
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: But you will never have a chance to use them. You will be buried with them right here. Although, you are a fortunate one...
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: After all, you will avoid having to see the tragic future that awaits your general.
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: I'm sure she understands her fate far better than you ever will. One day on the battlefield, she will be overpowered by her ever-intensifying Moon Rage and finally be torn apart by her fury and transformation.
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Not even your God can save her from this fate... Although, THEY can lead her to liberation.
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: And the only way to save her is here, in my hands.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Are you the healer or am I!? Are you really that certain of your own judgment?
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: I must leave, foxian. But before I go, you know what I must do, don't you?
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Drink bloodwine... I hear it is a borisin custom to kill prisoners and drink their blood before battle to stir up their madness.
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: You really did put hard work into researching us... It is a shame that this is where your journey ends.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Ah...
[Comrade in Arms][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance The Red Warcry 1.mp4
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: Are you... the healer, Jiaoqiu?
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Is there anything that I can do for you?
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: I heard that you saved me?
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: There's no need to thank me.
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: If you're a healer, can you cure my Moon Rage?
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: And what if I can? Do I just sit back and watch as you head back out to die in battle? Listen to me, child, your condition is not suited for the battlefield.
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: Okay... Then can you "cure" war?
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: What are you talking about? I'm just a healer! All I can do is—
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: So, all you can do is heal us, and let us go "cure" war.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Such arrogance, young lady! This war has been waged for thousands of years, and it will only continue! What do you mean by "cure" war? All you will achieve is getting yourself killed!
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: You healers work yourselves to the bone to save people, even though there will always be sickness and death. So we will also keep fighting.
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: I cannot speak for the dead. But, I know that General Yueyu... as well as all the warriors that never returned from battle will not have died in vain!
[Comrade in Arms][Young Voice]: They fought so that others could make it home alive. Your actions are no different.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[Comrade in Arms][Feixiao]: Jiaoqiu, this is an order! Cure me!
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: How do we get a picky child to eat green chilis?
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: How do we get a suspicious and devious wolf to drink down poison?
[Comrade in Arms][Narration]: I've already told you the answer.
[Comrade in Arms][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance Comrade in Arms.mp4
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: ...Those who have no secrets... are no more than prey... cut open and waiting for death...
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Enjoy the taste of my fresh blood... Hoolay. Unfortunately, I am not a man without secrets. I still have one little secret hidden up my sleeve...
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: Tumbledust... I drank it a while ago, and the poison is already flowing through my veins... Sooner or later... you will begin to feel the effects.
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: If the most lethal poison known to this world... is able to save innocent lives... Then it can also be called a great medicine...
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: I will do my best to cure you... Feixiao, I kept my promise. At the cost of this insignificant life...
[Comrade in Arms][Jiaoqiu]: ...bring victory to the Yaoqing.
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: So... you want to play dirty?
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: The air... it's colder?
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: My sword... is even colder.
[Comrade in Arms][Yunli]: Hoolay's movements are slowing down?
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: This is our chance!
[Comrade in Arms][March 7th]: It's time for us to put this dog down!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Jiaoqiu, you—!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: A pathetic little poison like this... You think this is enough to turn the tide of battle?
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: I may be slowing down...
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: But that does not mean you can defeat me...
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: You may be hard to kill, but that does not mean you cannot be overpowered!
[Comrade in Arms][Yanqing]: Hoolay! Take a good look. The power of the Cloud Knights is in my blade!
[Comrade in Arms][Hoolay]: Impossible! How could a mere whelp... defeat me?!

[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: This hunt is finally over. Thank you for holding out so long. The Cloud Knights are withdrawing as we speak.
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Lieutenant Yanqing, how are you holding up?
[Under the Spell][Narration]: I could take on ten more!
[Under the Spell][Yanqing]: I've never been better... I could take on ten more Hoolays...
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Take it easy, young one, your wounds look quite severe. I'll have the Alchemy Commission healers see to you when they arrive.
[Under the Spell][Narration]: General, how are things on the ground?
[Under the Spell][Yanqing]: General... is everything okay on the ground?
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Everything's fine. We were able to suppress the borisin attacks. When I sensed that Hoolay was not on the ground, I raced to get here as quickly as I could.
[Under the Spell][Narration]: You saved my life there.
[Under the Spell][Yanqing]: I... I thought I was done for.
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: I wouldn't want General Jing Yuan to lose the disciple that brings him so much pride. When I sensed that Hoolay was not on the ground, I raced to get here as quickly as I could.
[Under the Spell][Narration]: I can't believe you didn't tell me the plan...
[Under the Spell][Yanqing]: ...General, I can't believe you didn't tell me about the plan for the Skysplitter!
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Don't blame me, this was your general's idea. When he learned that you gave up being the ringmaster to join my Wolf Hunt team, he insisted that I hide the plan from you. Perhaps he thought your impatience would mess things up.
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Well? You may have run all over the place, but you ended up back here, did you not?
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Who would have imagined that I would arrive late to the battlefield for the first time in my life? ...No, perhaps you young ones' blades were just too fast for me.
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: I originally thought, in the best-case scenario, you would team up and hold this beast back while protecting yourselves. However... You joined forces and defeated Hoolay! The youth are truly to be feared and respected!
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Come, we need to lock up Hoolay once again before anything unexpected happens.
[Under the Spell][March 7th]: I—I was so scared! I thought you were a goner there! We're so lucky the general made it in time!
[Under the Spell][Yunli]: Yanqing, that was amazing! The final blow you dealt to Hoolay, how have I never seen that before?
[Under the Spell][Narration]: That's my special finishing move.
[Under the Spell][Yanqing]: Do you want to learn it? I can teach you! But, I'll need some time to heal up first...
[Under the Spell][Yunli]: I hate to say it, but if you can teach me that move, I'll maybe admit that you're just a tiny little bit stronger than me...
[Under the Spell][Narration]: Was it really us who defeated Hoolay?
[Under the Spell][Yanqing]: Was it... really us who defeated Hoolay? Why do I feel like he suddenly started to flag during our battle?
[Under the Spell][March 7th]: It must have been our awe-inspiring righteousness that struck fear into his heart!
[Under the Spell][Yunli]: You really are an overthinker! What's the point of worrying about these things? Who cares why he started to weaken? All that matters is that we won!
[Under the Spell][Hoolay]: Such an unforgettable blade... So similar to the one wielded by that woman who defeated me all those years ago.
[Under the Spell][Hoolay]: Over seven hundred years have passed, and I thought that I would have a way to overcome it by now. But in the end... my fangs and claws were too slow... You won, child.
[Under the Spell][Feixiao]: Stop struggling, Hoolay. There's plenty of time for you to be tortured by your regrets when you go back to The Shackling Prison.
[Under the Spell][Hoolay]: Yes, I was defeated, but this was not unexpected. And regardless, you still showed your face, Feixiao.
[Under the Spell][Hoolay]: Yes, I was defeated, but this was not unexpected. And regardless, you still showed your face, Feixiao.

[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I have looked forward to this for so long. Our little hunting game has finally reached its climax... I told you before that I had a path prepared for you...
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: You've doomed yourselves...
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: As I meet my demise, so shall the entire Xianzhou Luofu!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: The "crimson moon" in my chest will make this place shine with blood!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I will drive all foxians to madness in their fear... craving slaughter... without end!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: What now, Feixiao...?
[Salvation by Starlance][Yunli]: ...What is this!?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: This is the "heart" of the Borisin Warhead, a product of the plaguemark.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I'll leave the next part to you.
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: General, I don't understand...
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: We cannot allow this thing to spread. I will do all within my power to consume this "crimson moon."
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Once the situation changes... Lieutenant Yanqing, you are to enforce the Cloud Knight's military rules. Understood?
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: General?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Die, borisin!
[Salvation by Starlance][Yunli]: Wh—What!? We clearly don't have wolf ears!
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I will not allow any of you... to leave the Skysplitter!
[Salvation by Starlance][Yunli]: Does she think we are her enemies?
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: Hoolay just wanted to take down the general, even at the cost of his own life!
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: Snap out of it, General!
[Salvation by Starlance][March 7th]: Ugh! Just when I thought we'd get a minute to catch our breath!
[Salvation by Starlance][March 7th]: What do we do? Do we fight, or run?
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: After all this, do you still think running is an option?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Stop trying to resist me!
[Salvation by Starlance][Yunli]: We can't let her get away!
[Salvation by Starlance][March 7th]: ...But do we stand any chance at all?
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: She said "I'll leave the next part to you."
[Salvation by Starlance][Yanqing]: She put her faith in us!

[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: No one can live forever, Jiaoqiu... This time, I must break my promise.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Is this... the Skysplitter? Or somewhere else?
[Salvation by Starlance][Unclear Voice]: Lieutenant Yanqing, you are to enforce the Cloud Knights' military rules. Understood?
[Salvation by Starlance][Unclear Voice]: We can't let her get away!
[Salvation by Starlance][Unclear Voice]: Snap out of it, General!
[Salvation by Starlance][???]: You always leave the hardest battles for yourself.
[Salvation by Starlance][???]: Even now, you would never run away.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Isn't it strange? That as your enemy, I understand you even better than your own allies?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Hoolay...?
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: This rage... I remember the taste. I know that it was never victory that it thirsted for, but the hunt itself.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Isn't that right, Feixiao?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: You shouldn't be here. I saw you die with my own eyes...
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Just consider me a figment of your imagination.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Before every hunt, I make preparations for defeat and retreat. But not this time. This time... defeat was exactly the ending I was racing towards.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: When I learned your story from Jiaoqiu, I realized... that he had always been hiding a secret... and that not even the healer himself understood the meaning of this secret.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: What an ironic fate, don't you think? All this time, waiting for this day to come, I never imagined that this was how it would turn out.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: ...But, I accept it.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Now, let us break through the iron-clad defenses of the Arbiter-General's heart and see what secrets she has hidden in those deepest, darkest corners.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: The familiar smell of death, like a vulture...
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I'm sure that the people of the Xianzhou have shown you these familiar scenes countless times. But they only showed you what they wanted you to see.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: They have you fight to save the weak. But, what they never told you is that when all the pretenses of kindness and compassion are stripped away, this is how the universe is meant to be.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: When the Xianzhou is weak, they play the victim so they can win your sympathy. When they are strong, they make you their avenger and have you fight in the name of justice.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I've found it... This is your shadow of "doubt."
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Your so-called survival of the fittest is nothing but an excuse.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: You cannot weaken my resolve, Hoolay.
[Salvation by Starlance][Voice of Huaiyan]: Blinded by the fury of your Moon Rage, you slaughtered your allies... Merlin's Claw, you have betrayed the Alliance!
[Salvation by Starlance][Voice of Huaiyan]: Your actions are no different from those of the abominations we stand against!
[Salvation by Starlance][Voice of Jing Yuan]: At the end of the day, it is the blood of the abominations that runs through your veins... One day, you will inevitably become an enemy of the Alliance. Cloud Knights, formation!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: You ran into the arms of your new masters' army without hesitation. You thought that you had found freedom, respect, and recognition.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: But you were wrong. They know all too well that a wolf will always be a wolf.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Now, your greatest fear is about to come true: You have become an enemy of the Xianzhou.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: This... This is your "fear."
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: You aim to instill terror within me...
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Yet, all of this is nothing but a... phantom.
[Salvation by Starlance][Borisin]: You have returned... Lord Feixiao! The Warhead has returned!
[Salvation by Starlance][Borisin]: Long live the Warhead! Lord Feixiao will grant us our future!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: It's time to return to the pack, Feixiao.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: No matter how deep the hatred you bear for the borisin... No matter how much we may consider each other enemies... I will still show you this path that you never imagined was available to you, because you made a choice...
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: You devoured the Crimson Moon. You are worthy to become the borisin's Warhead.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: What... did you say?
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: The descendants of Duran who came to rescue me hoped with all their hearts that once I regained my freedom, I would be able to turn the tide of battle and change the fate of our people, allowing the borisin to return to their former glory! But this was just a dream used by someone with ulterior motives to manipulate the borisin.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: They would rather place their hopes of survival on an imaginary savior than gain the courage and strength to fight to the death. Borisin like that deserve no more than to be sent to their deaths!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: And I, a prisoner who was held captive for over seven hundred years, a criminal of war who was deprived even an honorable death in battle, would become a puppet upon my return, at the mercy of others. This is a fate that I will never accept!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: For those who are truly strong, "foxian" and "borisin" are no more than labels. Someone who is truly strong chooses their own path.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I will create that new path for myself. I will pass the right to decide the destiny of the borisin on to you... former borisin war slave and future foxian ruler.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Your healer, Jiaoqiu, served you with such loyalty. He was even willing to die in order to cure your Moon Rage. I told him before that the only way to save you lay in my hands.
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: "Hoolay": If you just nod your head, you will awaken from this nightmare that the Crimson Moon has inflicted on you, and your body will be born anew. From that moment, you will no longer be trapped by your rage, your doubt will be swept from your mind like dust, and your fear will naturally disappear.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: So, this was the "path" that you prepared for me... To become a new you?
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: That's right, we are so similar after all. We are both monsters that were born for war and will die for war.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: ...I'm sure my answer doesn't need much explanation.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I refuse.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I told you before, "foxian" and "borisin" are no more than labels! You can be whoever you want to be. You can do whatever you want to do!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Accept these truths and the borisin will bow to you. Destroy them, reduce them to dust, or teach them to become servants of the Xianzhou... You are free to do as you please.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Carve your name into the Xianzhou's history books, or into the List of Archenemies. You have the final say.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: You do not understand, Hoolay. You have no idea what it is that I truly desire.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: When I was just a child, I stained my hands with blood for the first time, in order to escape the whips and shackles of the wolf masters.

[Salvation by Starlance][Saran]: They're still behind us, don't stop! Neergul, look up! Look at that light in the sky!
[Salvation by Starlance][Saran]: That's a "shooting star"! It's shining down on us! If we just tell it our wish, we can have our freedom!
[Salvation by Starlance][Saran]: We will all be able to escape! We'll win our freedom and then share it with our koolur brothers and sisters!
[Salvation by Starlance][Saran]: So, you have to run, quickly! We can do it, we can escape!
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: From the dense darkness behind, comes the fierce howls of wolves and the cries of wild beasts.
[Salvation by Starlance][Saran]: Neergul! Run with me!
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: ...
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: We ran and ran with all the strength we had, but we ended up losing each other.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I escaped the hunting pack and encountered a woman that could fly... a Cloud Knight.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I imagine you kept your promise.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Unfortunately, when I led her back in order to free my koolur companions, there was nothing left there but a bottomless pit.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: The light of the Devilish Archer... A star of calamity that strikes the ground and leaves only devastation in its wake.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: In the years that followed, I followed the trail of that light alongside my Cloud Knight allies, and saw it fall countless more times.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Gradually I came to understand. That light was not some shooting star that carried wishes and aspirations. Each Lux Arrow meant that countless lives in a helpless world were about to be obliterated.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I prayed to the God of the Skybow that I would never have to witness one of these "shooting stars" fall again.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: But... THEY ignored my prayers.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: That's right, THEY never answer us. THEY just let us loose in this world to massacre each other. That is why the fierce battle between us has raged to this day.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: If the gods, who never bleed nor cry, who watch silently from above, refuse to listen to the prayers of mortals, then we have no choice but to fight for our own desires!
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Do you understand now, Saran... You and I are similar in more ways than you think.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: ...
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: You are a beast that was born for war and will die for war!
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: ...Perhaps.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: So, what is it that you yearn for, Hoolay? Why is it that you fight?
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: I fight so that I can turn the stars above into a great wilderness for the borisin to roam.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: What about you, Saran?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I fight so that one day, I will never have to witness another "shooting star" falling to the ground... So that just one more person can live and return to the Yaoqing alongside me.
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: You would resist becoming the person you were supposed to be, lower yourself from a free wolf to a domesticated fox just for... the sake of one person?
[Salvation by Starlance][Hoolay]: Then have it your way! I will use your fear and doubt as my nourishment. I will seize you and devour you! I will replace you and... become "Feixiao"!
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: We are so similar, both monsters that were born for war and will die for war... You were right when you said that, Hoolay.
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: So, I shall pray to the heavens... even if THEY do not respond to me. I pray that the arrows of The Hunt will pierce the heart of every monster!
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: Do you see me... "shooting star"?
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: "The Knights are sworn to protect the Xianzhou."
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I will uphold this vow... until my very last day.
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Shadow of "Feixiao": Since the day I was born, the skies have cried tears of blood, and all living creatures have howled and lamented.

[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: I will tear back your disguises and show you how cowardly and powerless you truly are, Hoolay!
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Shadow of "Feixiao": A wolf lurks in the heart of every borisin and foxian...
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Shadow of "Feixiao": The moment you grow weak, it will devour you!
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Shadow of "Feixiao": Grow complacent and your life will be stolen!
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Shadow of "Feixiao": Fight to the death and you shall live forever!
[Salvation by Starlance][Feixiao]: If it wants to devour me, it will first have to beg for my mercy!
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Shadow of "Feixiao": Prey, taste my blade as it pierces your skin!

[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: And this time, there's one more business that must be settled with the affair around Hoolay's jailbreak...
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: Switching to Lingsha's POV...
[Salvation by Starlance][Narration]: In Scalegorge Waterscape, Dan Heng and Lingsha are scheduled to meet with the Vidyadhara Preceptors...

[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: I'd like to hear their explanations.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Welcome, Miss Lingsha. I am Preceptor Taoran.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: Greetings, my honored Preceptor. It's been a while since we last touched base. I've brought a friend with me today. I believe you're already familiar with each other.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: Taoran... Elder Taoran? I remember when I was exiled, you were on the verge of passing on. What's with this new look?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: All of this is thanks to your past life. Had you not been so rash, I wouldn't have had to walk such a dangerous road to free our clan, becoming this specter of my former self.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: ...
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Dan Heng, you've returned twice, but it seems that meeting us fossils wasn't on your agenda. Regrettable, indeed. Now here you are to meet me anyway — life does love its ironies, doesn't it?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: I didn't come here with Miss Lingsha today to reminisce.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Indeed. When the Cauldron Master extends an invitation, it's only proper for the Preceptors to attend.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: As the newly appointed Cauldron Master, there's been much to take care of within the Alchemy Commission. It's only now that I've had the chance to speak with you. Please forgive the delay, Elder.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: I sent over some evidence regarding the prison break in The Shackling Prison. I trust you've already looked it over.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Yes, you sent us the remains of mara-struck soldiers, a map of The Shackling Prison, and a Semblance Reversion Essence pill.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: These are the remains of assassins who used cloudhymn magic to conceal their tracks. They aided in the borisin's escape, allowing them unimpeded passage through The Shackling Prison.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: That marked-up map is a map of prisoners' escape routes. Vidyadhara craftsmen once made blueprints for the prison's construction, so I imagine, Mr. Taoran, you have a similar map in your possession. This pill —
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Is Semblance Reversion Essence. Indeed, I helped plot the prison break in The Shackling Prison.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: So the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus joining forces with the Lord Ravager to stir up trouble in the Alchemy Commission, the introduction of the Stellaron, and the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection — all have something to do with the Vidyadhara?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: That's right.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Narration]: So you admit it?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Are you surprised? After all, both of you were sent here by the Seat of Divine Foresight as messengers, to hear my confession, weren't you?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Narration]: This is not unexpected, but it still brings me pain.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: You were sent here by the general to hear my confession, weren't you? If there's even a shred of empathy in you, you should understand the reasons behind everything I've done.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Ever since the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the population of the Vidyadhara has dwindled. With the high elder exiled, a few of us Preceptors had to do what we could to turn the tide. My methods might have been drastic, perhaps even incomprehensible, but it was all for one cause — the survival of the Vidyadhara.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Yet, the Xianzhou natives zealously forbid any plaguemarks and did nothing while the Vidyadhara suffered. Dan Heng, Lingsha, as Vidyadhara, you should understand the desperation behind my actions. All I've tried to do is to ensure our survival.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: I'm well aware of the challenges the Vidyadhara face. Fighting for survival isn't a sin.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: But Elder, your actions have gone beyond mere survival... You've become a beast driven solely by the Propagation, devoid of even a hint of empathy.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Oh? Despite calling ourselves a "noble draconic bloodline," at our core, we're merely bipedal beasts. The survival of our kind is paramount. If I hadn't resorted to beastly actions, the Vidyadhara might not even exist!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: The sages show no mercy, as the old wisdom goes. When the high elder abandoned our people's survival, I had to shoulder the world's sins alone!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Lingsha, Dan Heng, the past is behind us, but the future of the Vidyadhara still lies within your grasp. The situation on the Xianzhou Luofu has changed rapidly. As Vidyadhara, we must unite in purpose and avoid the mistakes of the previous Imbibitor Lunae.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: I was initially skeptical about the Vidyadhara's betrayal of the Alliance... But after hearing your confession, I realize that there is no point in talking about trust.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: Breaking the covenant of our alliance will bring war upon the Vidyadhara. Even if we are able to have offspring again, what difference will it make?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Once my plan succeeds, the alliance will see the Vidyadhara as their saviors, because both parties ultimately share the same interests.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: Oh? So now that "survival" won't convince us, you want to talk about "interests"?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: For a thousand years, the Alliance has been engaged in brutal warfare against the Denizens of Abundance, yet victory has remained beyond reach. Have you ever wondered why? Should the Alliance emerge victorious, they will inevitably become the next Denizens of Abundance. However, if they suffer defeat, the Alliance will face extinction.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Thus, the Alliance has deceitfully upheld this precarious balance. However, I have a way to escape from this dilemma.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: The Alliance's path to salvation lies within the secret of dragon transmutation!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Imagine if there were a way to transform other life forms into Vidyadhara. The Alliance would then possess an endless stream of soldiers and would not need to worry about casualties.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Once the war ended, these soldiers would cease reproduction, eliminating concerns of overpopulation. This is the way to salvation for the Xianzhou Alliance, the ultimate path to end the universe's suffering under the immortality plague. Only we, the Vidyadhara, can achieve this!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: So, you relied on this rhetoric to manipulate the ignorant members of the Vidyadhara into serving you?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: I am deeply disappointed in you, Elder. Your thoughts and intentions are completely devoid of empathy. Cloud Knights!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Hold it!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: Miss Bailu!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Bailu]: Mr. Dan Heng, and Sister Lingsha! Everyone's... here?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: You think I don't know why you're really here? Jing Yuan sent you here to test me, didn't he?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: According to the oath between the Alliance and the Vidyadhara, it's forbidden to spill Vidyadhara blood on their own territory. Are you all ready to violate this oath in the presence of the Luofu's high elder?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: Dragon Lady, there's no need to panic. Elder, the Vidyadhara sacred grounds and the high elder are not to be used as pawns in exchange for your life!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: You talk a big game, as if you have the nation and people's best interests at heart. But when it really matters, you use a small girl as your shield. It's ridiculously pitiful.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: I've said it before, survival is never a sin. We are all Vidyadhara, so you should understand my intentions. And as a Vidyadhara, I will leave for you a dignified solution.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Leave the Scalegorge Waterscape immediately, and appeal to the top echelons of the Alliance. Let the Six Charioteers hold a trial and sentence me to exuviation and rebirth.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Narration]: Exuviation?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Narration]: You wish for rebirth?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: I see right through your plans, Mr. Taoran. Vidyadhara rebirth erases past crimes... but I'm well aware of the Preceptors' dirty tricks during rebirth. You might not be you, but you will still be you.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: I won't forgive myself for past sins under the pretext of "knowing nothing," nor will I allow you to evade accountability.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Dan Heng, I've always disliked your inability to see the bigger picture. Rebirth hasn't changed you one bit.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: Miss Bailu, as high elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara, please share your thoughts at this moment.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Bailu]: I... I don't want to stay here. I'm tired of being pushed around! I'm not some puppet to be controlled! Please, take me away with you!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: I understand.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: As the oath dictates, members of the Alliance are forbidden from harming Vidyadhara here. But I've long since severed ties with the Alliance. Right now I'm simply a Nameless, free to come and go as I please.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Dan Heng]: The oath of the Xianzhou means nothing to the spear in my hand!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Get them! Do whatever it takes! Make sure they don't leave here alive!
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: Dragon Lady, are you alright?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Bailu]: I... I'm fine. Thank you for rescuing me.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: You... you actually came here in person!?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Jing Yuan]: Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to hear your lofty opinions.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Jing Yuan]: The public trial you seek with the Six Charioteers is inevitable. In addition, I'll write to the Seiche Queller of the Fanghu. With her hatred for evil, I'm sure she will make a just decision.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Lingsha]: If it's her, she will earn the respect and assent of all the Vidyadhara on the Luofu.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: ...In terms of martial prowess, you indeed have the upper hand. But if you're under the impression that this advantage can be used to settle the score with us Preceptors, that's quite an overestimation.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Given the Vidyadhara's foundation within the Alliance, do you really think you can do anything to us?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: As I mentioned, I'll take all the blame and become the scapegoat.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: With the secrets I possess, the interrogation alone will take an eternity. And in the end, through various exchanges of interests, I am certain to survive. You understand this better than anyone, as it's the very art of "trade-offs" you love to wield.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Lastly, a word of caution to you... I heard that Hoolay has escaped from prison and is headed directly for the Skysplitter. The bloodshed at the Wardance is bound to be gruesome. Perhaps, even before my trial, your impeachment will have you in dire straits first?
[Ebb of Past Sins][Jing Yuan]: Regrettably, Mr. Taoran, the Skysplitter only hosted Cloud Knights today, no audience.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Jing Yuan]: And just moments ago, Hoolay was executed by the Cloud Knights.
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: ...
[Ebb of Past Sins][Taoran]: Heh... Haha... Hahahahaha...
[Ebb of Past Sins][Narration]: Returning to the Trailblazer's POV...
[Ebb of Past Sins][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Operation "Wolfhunt Showdown" has ended. The messengers from the Realm-Keeping Commission are calming down the populace and the momentary disruption has subsided.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Meanwhile, in the Alchemy Commission,  is mourning for someone...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Bailu]: Waaah... Miss March...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: : ...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: March 7th... I didn't think you'd...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: There's so much we didn't have the chance to say...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Bailu]: Miss March! My dear Miss March!
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: I was only in the bathroom for a little bit, and you've already arranged my death? , can't you play some normal games with Dragon Lady?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: This kind of make-believe adds a genuine touch!
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Thanks a lot for that!
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: This was Bailu's idea!
[A Fugue From Beyond][Bailu]: You really can't keep your mouth shut, can you?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Help! It's a zombie!
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Are you amused?
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Alright! Enough playing. It's time to visit my masters.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Bailu]: The infirmary is right over there. You can go by yourselves. Come back and visit me when you have time!
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Next time, let's not play overly realistic make-believe with , okay?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: : Well, there's not much I could do. General Feixiao didn't really give me any chance to shine during this Wolf Hunt operation.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: : If I had been in the ring, I could've knocked down ten Hoolays with just one strike.
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: You sound exactly like Master Yanqing. But for now, both he and Yunli have been forced to go to the Alchemy Commission for some well-needed rest.
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: I'm the least accomplished in swordplay, but I came out unscathed. I really ought to thank my masters for taking all the blows on my behalf.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: Look who's here. The beloved  and the charming March 7th.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: You came to the Alchemy Commission today... Oh, I get it.  is here with March to visit her masters, aren't you?
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Exactly. How are my masters doing at the moment?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: Unfortunately, only one master is here. I'm doing fine.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Did Master Yunli run out on her own?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: I'm just following the doctor's advice. Miss Bailu said I could take a stroll, so here I am.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: Your Master Yanqing wasn't as lucky. He's probably still in bed...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Master Yanqing... didn't make it in the end?
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Hey, watch your words! Don't you jinx my master!
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: His injuries weren't that severe... but well, he'll still need some more time to rest.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: Considering the intense battle with Hoolay and then with General Feixiao... ahem, the rigorous sparring session with her! His small body couldn't take it anymore.
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Master Yunli, didn't you also engage in combat?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: Haha, the little babies from the Luofu just don't have the resilience that us kids from the Zhuming have!
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: I heard from Moze about the tough battle against the Wolftroopers. , you fought alongside Moze. Did you get hurt?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: ...The enemies were mostly taken care of by General Feixiao.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: I heard a few versions of the story from the Cloud Knights who were there. The number of Wolftroopers went from a few dozen to thousands, and the number keeps rising. It's becoming more absurd by the minute!
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Now that I think about it, I didn't really have a chance to get hurt.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: I can guess why: General Feixiao is just too strong.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: Yunli, go and lie down!
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yunli]: Got it, Lingsha.
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: What about that smiley fox healer and the guy with the hood...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: Thank goodness  and the others found Jiaoqiu. He lost a lot of blood and needs to rest properly. He and Moze are seriously wounded. I've had to forcibly confine them to the Alchemy Commission.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: All three from the Yaoqing are critically injured, but fortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu has a miraculous Healer Lady. It's a silver lining in this misfortune.
[A Fugue From Beyond][March 7th]: Ah, it looks like the entire delegation from the Xianzhou Yaoqing has gathered at the Alchemy Commission. Why don't we go see General Feixiao and bring her some fruit?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: I would normally say no because they need to rest... but, alas, what can you do when the two of them have a leader who is just as restless?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: General Feixiao just slipped out of the recovery room. She thinks she's so sneaky, but I know everything that happens in the Alchemy Commission.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Lingsha]: If you're looking to meet her, the Lunarescent Depths might be your best bet. I spotted her heading that way earlier.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: The sound of those footsteps... They must belong to General Feixiao. Out and about despite the doctor's orders?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: What a coincidence! Someone else who refuses to listen to the doctor's orders.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: Well, being a doctor myself, I don't think my knowledge of my own body is inferior to the Dragon Lady's.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: The healer does not heal himself. Don't try to act tough in front of me.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: ... I'm sorry, Jiaoqiu. I didn't expect you to use poison that way. What a miscalculation. If only I'd found you sooner... If only I hadn't sent you to The Shackling Prison...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: The way you're speaking, is this really the Feixiao I know? Or could it be a borisin assassin, imitating your voice to take my life?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: ...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: Jiaoqiu, your eyes... You can't see anymore, can you?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: I can still clearly hear the sound of the waves. That's enough for me.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: Don't blame yourself. You know what I'm more concerned about. Has your body had any changes since you swallowed the Crimson Moon?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: I'm not sure. There don't appear to be any changes... However, the many doubts that once plagued me have dissipated.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: I never thought I'd live to hear you discuss your health again... But thanks to Moze and that child, the price I've paid seems trivial compared to what we've achieved.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: I hold no grievances, Feixiao. I am content.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: ...I don't know how to offer words of comfort, nor do I know much about curing others' ailments.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: I am just a warrior, so my pledge to you is simple...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Moze]: ...An eye for an eye.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: So you were here too.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: In this vast universe, there's bound to be someone who can heal your eyes. I'll find them. But until then...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: The threat behind all this chaos needs to be dealt with.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: You must already have some ideas. Let them out.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: The resurgence of the Sanctus Medicus and the gathering of the borisin... are merely distractions orchestrated by an unseen force, meant to divide the Alliance's attention.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: Unfortunately, they picked the wrong fight this time. Once we return to the Yaoqing, I'll personally lead the Verdant Knights into battle.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: ...I vow to take down a Lord Ravager and teach the Ruin Legion the true meaning of The Hunt.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: ...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jiaoqiu]: I knew it... You've always been so impatient.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Seat of Divine Foresight
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: I apologize for my tardiness, once again.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: The Alchemy Commission detained me for some time for a health examination. They released me only after ensuring I was in good condition.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: General, seeing you safe and sound puts our minds at ease.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: Hoolay's escape caused significant upheaval and forced the Wardance to be put on hold — a truly unforeseen disaster. Fortunately, the younger generation showed their valor. They bravely tackled the crisis, putting an end to the disaster and providing a glimmer of hope in a dire situation.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: Before Master Diviner Fu Xuan's departure for the Yuque, I consulted with her about the Wardance. She left a note stating, "The hexagram oscillates between thunder and heaven, a sign of great power," assuring us that we would successfully navigate any challenges.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: She advised me to trust the younger generation's abilities and let them lead. Her predictions, it appears, have come true.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: It's just... the Xianzhou Luofu's longstanding duty of keeping Hoolay imprisoned ended with his death on the Skysplitter. This event is likely to bring much criticism from the Alliance's upper ranks.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: However, Hoolay's demise might actually be a blessing in disguise. Broadcasting this news could derail the borisin's resurgence and quash the ambitions of those who wished to take advantage of his return.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: Hand over Hoolay's remains to the Xianzhou Yaoqing, and I'll handle the explanations to the Alliance.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: But, what about the Wardance? While the wolf-hunt mission was a success, the events on the Skysplitter remain a secret. However, the news of the borisin's attacks on the streets will spread like wildfire.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: The Wardance was interrupted, so it must be reconvened. As for the people who witnessed the attacks, beyond placating them, we also need to show them the Xianzhou Cloud Knights' fearless dedication.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: "On the Wardance's opening day, rogue borisin attempted to stir up panic but were swiftly neutralized by the Merlin's Claw and the Cloud Knights." A genuine tale of heroism that will captivate and calm the public.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: As Elder Huaiyan suggests, the Luofu will do its best to heal the wounded and compensate those who were affected. We aim to reopen the Wardance in the coming weeks.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: This settles the immediate concerns on the Luofu, but my thoughts linger on the orchestrator behind these events.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: From the onset of the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis, the Xianzhou Luofu has experienced numerous disturbances, directly linked to the Lord Ravager Phantylia.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: Her attempt to infiltrate the Xianzhou with the borisin and sway the Luofu Preceptors to join the Sanctus Medicus' insurrection was unsuccessful. But I have a feeling that she is indifferent to the success of her plans.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: Rather than outright victory, Phantylia's motive seems to lie in breeding discord and chaos among allies. Should the Alliance fail to mend these rifts, it risks disintegrating into a pile of sand.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: The goal of the Xianzhou Alliance has not changed for thousands of years. Perhaps we should point the weapons in our hands toward this new adversary. I plan to bring this matter before the marshal following the Wardance.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: With Elder Huaiyan's insight, one wonders how the marshal will react.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: It's clear we're engaged in a game of chess not seen in thousands of Amber Eras, a game where even the strategists become pawns in battle, where the stakes are as high as the fates of countless stars in the sky.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: Predicting the marshal's decision is beyond me, yet she's well aware of our concerns. She has tasked General Yaoguang with performing extrapolations day and night to gauge the situation comprehensively.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: We gathered today not just to tackle the Luofu's predicaments but also to address a matter requiring our collective presence.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: Yaoguang has sent a message from the Xianzhou Yuque, informing us that she wishes to share the results of recent calculations she made within the matrix.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: Jing Yuan, I'd like to borrow the Seat of Divine Foresight's "chess board" for this purpose.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: An ancient "bell" has been struck in the depths of the Xianzhou Yuque, its soundwaves rippling over the valleys and hills of gravity.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: Thus, light bursts forth from the chessboard's grid, weaving into a seal symbolizing the Seer Strategist's authority.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Media]: Trailblaze Continuance A Fugue From Beyond.mp4
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: Hello everyone, it's been a long time! Over three decades have passed since we last convened, and I've dearly missed each of you generals during this time ☰☰.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: Was the Seer Strategist thinking of us, or thinking of the fates we're destined for?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: The Merlin's Claw, as blunt as always, ☳☶ though not everyone's cup of tea, huh?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: You once told Jing Yuan, "You're lucky that I'm the one who came this time. If it were the Seer Strategist, this conversation might not be so friendly." I'm intrigued — did that conversation really come to pass?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: I've never heard anyone mention that the Deca-Light Reflection Barrier could eavesdrop on even the quietest whispers. It appears that the marshal sent not just two generals to the Luofu but an uninvited third guest as well.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: People have been saying that Mr. Jing Yuan's intellect shines as brightly as the Seer Strategist's. With the Luofu caught in such strife, the Yuque couldn't just stand by and watch.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Huaiyan]: Seer Strategist, our time with the Yellowbell is limited. Let's get straight to the point.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: Alright. Thanks to Mr. Jing Yuan, the interrogation of the two prisoners on the Yuque has concluded.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: Mr. Jing Yuan's speculations were correct. Of the crimes they confessed to, planting a Stellaron on the Luofu was a complete fabrication, meant to mislead.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: Their real aim was to secure a meeting with the marshal to present their Godslayer Protocol — a strategy they firmly believe in.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Jing Yuan]: And what was this grand strategy proposed by Jingliu and that traveler?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: The narrative they painted was vast and difficult to put into words ☳☳. It all revolves around the coffin of the blond traveler...
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: ...to be precise, it's the remnants of the Propagation.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Feixiao]: The remains of the Swarm Author?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: More accurately, it's a fragment of the divine body. In the future they depicted, this fragment serves as the final nail, sealing the fate of the Plagues Author and securing its doom.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: Before reaching that point, battling the gods necessitates a larger alliance. Hence, they sought out an ally for the Xianzhou.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: I assume you've all heard of the famed Genius Society member #81, Ruan Mei, haven't you? The "eye" of the Yuque has just seen this uninvited guest arrive on the Xianzhou Luofu.
[A Fugue From Beyond][Yaoguang]: ...Three, two, one. Right on time! Now, as for the best way to receive our distinguished guest... I'll leave that in your capable hands.
[A Fugue From Beyond][???]: Do you remember your name?
[A Fugue From Beyond][Narration]: ...
[A Fugue From Beyond][???]: My name is... Tingyun. I serve as an amicassador of the Whistling Flames merchant guild on the Xianzhou Luofu...

[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: , you're finally here! We've been waiting for so long.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: It's only been five minutes.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: Since everyone's here, let's get down to business.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: The Astral Express just received an invitation to the Planet of Festivities...
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Hang on! Why am I getting a sense of deja vu?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Is it going to be a repeat of the Charmony Festival?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Even the Planet of Festivities can't possibly hold a festival every day!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Are we going to look for the Watchmaker's Legacy again?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: I don't think he had that many legacies to leave behind...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Are we all still in a dream?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Please don't! We don't need to go through that again!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Don't worry — the Express received a normal invitation this time. It's from Penacony's "Paperfold University".
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: The university plans to hold an academic conference on the topic of "Trailblazing" in the Moment of Sol. The Astral Express has been invited as guests to the conference.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: An academic conference... You mean we'll have to sit in an auditorium and spend several system hours talking about a few hundred slides' worth of scholarly discourse?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: Don't worry, you can leave such "boring" events to the grown-ups. I will attend the conference with Welt. As for the three of you...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: If you are interested, you can enter the university as guest students.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Guest students?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Well, it happens to be the start of the academic term, and Paperfold University is preparing for its Dreamlight Anniversary. These annual festivities serve as both a welcoming gift for new students, and a chance to celebrate for those already enrolled.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Why don't you youngsters join the new students? You could explore the campus, experience student life...
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: D—Do we have to study?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: ...That's great! A young cute girl full of energy living her best life on campus? That experience is practically made for me!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: I hear that Paperfold University is well-known throughout the universe as a top arts school. I would love to check it out too.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Campus life, here I come!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Campus life...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Awesome! I'll finally have some academic credentials!
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: That's a really practical way of looking at it...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Sorry to disappoint, but Paperfold University doesn't issue certificates to guest students. However, I believe you'll gain something far more valuable than a certificate.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Help! I don't want to go to school!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Haha, don't worry — guest students don't get a lot of homework. Besides, all of the professors and students are busy preparing for the festivities. Just... treat it as a party.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Campus life without homework or examinations? That sounds like paradise!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: Looks like everyone can't wait. Let's go ahead with that plan, then. I will submit the admission documents to Paperfold University. We'll leave once everyone is ready. Let's all have some fun.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: "Campus..." That word sure brings back a lot of memories.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Himeko]: Now that you mention it, I recall that you had a teaching stint back home. Any delightful stories that come to mind?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Welt]: Haha, too many to count. Then again, these admission documents will take us a while to complete — I'll see if I can dig up any stories for you.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Electives, extracurricular activities, campus parties... I want to try them all!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Take me along.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Of course. We're schoolmates now!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: It might not be as fun as you're imagining.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Ooh, is someone having a case of nerves? We're just going to school. How bad can it be?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Actually, I've never been to school before.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: You and I are the only ones with ambiguous educational qualifications on the Express... Oh wait, there's Pom-Pom too.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Never mind. Let's just relax and enjoy ourselves on campus. I'll be in your care now, !
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: As the top university in Penacony, the strict examinations and expensive tuition have deterred many potential candidates. The people who are admitted to the school are either well-known wealthy merchants or exceptionally talented geniuses.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: Because of this, I hear that the culture on campus has a truly Penaconian flavor. How intriguing.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: A comfy couch that makes you drowsy as soon as you lie down on it — let's just hope this trip doesn't send you into another strange dream.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ready to go.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: On your way to Penacony, you unsurprisingly dozed off...
[An Andalusian Monkey][???]: Ba, na, na, na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][???]: Ba, na, na, na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: The strange sounds lingered by your ears, but your drowsiness overcame the noise, and your eyelids remained unmoved...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: ...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Talk with the others a little longer.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: We've arrived. , why do you always fall asleep when we're warping? I couldn't even wake you up.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I'm tired. Not enough sleep.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: What have you been doing at night instead of sleeping?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Oh, so that ruckus was you?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: What do you mean ruckus!? I was really gentle when trying to wake you up.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Uh, what do you mean I fell asleep!?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Never mind. Just don't look so lost when we're in class later, or you might just sleep yourself to Dreamflux Reef.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: Alright, let's go check in.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Himeko and Mr. Yang still have to participate in social networking. Being an adult sure is hard.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Alley]: Welcome to The Reverie, distinguished shareholders.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Oh, I almost forgot that we're Penacony's shareholders!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Alley]: Upon hearing the news that you were returning to Penacony, the hotel prepared six Platinum Guest Rooms for your stay. They are ready for you anytime.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: Six?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Alley]: That's right. Besides the three of you, Miss Himeko, and Mr. Yang... Pom-Pom had already checked in three days ago.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Pom-Pom?
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Pom-Pom? What are you talking about?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: ...I see. We thank The Family for their gracious hospitality. Please help us with the check-in.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Alley]: Of course. Your Dreamscape Passes have been activated. I hope that you have another enjoyable stay in Penacony.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: We didn't have an enjoyable stay the last time, though...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: Apologies for interrupting you earlier.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Dan Heng, do you know something that we don't? Why did the front desk mention that Pom-Pom is staying at the hotel too?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: If my guess is correct, it's probably Boothill checking in under Pom-Pom's name.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Boothill?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: That Galaxy Ranger?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You mean Mr. Holy Forkeroni!?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: Yes. When we worked together in Penacony the last time... he used Pom-Pom's identity then, too. He's the only one I can think of who would do that.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Boothill? What is he doing here?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: I don't know. Galaxy Rangers always work alone, but I don't think Boothill will do anything that is detrimental to the Express.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dan Heng]: Since "Pom-Pom" checked in three days ago, we can probably find him in the dream. We'll ask him more about it then.
[An Andalusian Monkey][March 7th]: Let's get going then. Paperfold University is located in the Moment of Sol. The hotel has set the entrance to the dream near the school, so let's meet at the gates!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: Hurry up! I hear that the major shareholders have already arrived at the lobby. Don't alarm them!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Panicking Bloodhound]: I know! But that fella was running in this direction. How did he disappear so quickly...?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: Shh! Someone else is here. Who are you?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I'm one of the Nameless on the Astral Express.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: The what Express now? Don't try to sell me anything. My miserable pay can't afford to buy an Express of any sorts!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I'm the Superstar from the Festivity Auditions.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: The what Auditions? Sorry, I usually just relax in my free time and never watch variety shows!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I'm a VIP.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: Oh, cut it out. Everyone who comes here calls themselves a VIP. It doesn't mean anything to me by this point.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: I don't care who you are. The Bloodhound Family is investigating a case here. Please make way.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Panicking Bloodhound]: Wait a second! Gray hair, yellow eyes, ribbons that serve no purpose on  clothes... I think 's the major shareholder you were talking about!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: What!? For the love of... Couldn't you have said that earlier!?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: Ahem, I beg your pardon, esteemed guest. I was a bit brusque earlier. The Bloodhounds are just carrying out a routine inspection. All guest rooms and facilities are in good order, so please be at ease and enjoy your stay.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Panicking Bloodhound]: But... the suspect...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Suspect?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: You...! Sus... sustainable! Ah, yes, sustainable! We know frequent inspections may not seem sustainable to some, but these procedures ensure a safe and secure environment for guests, so the Bloodhounds are more than happy to do so. We'll take our leave for now. Please have a good rest!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Panicking Bloodhound]: Um... Please stay safe, and be careful in the dream...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rash Bloodhound]: Alright, that's enough. Come on, let's go!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkey Doll]: ...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You notice a strange... monkey doll in the room?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Judging from the materials, you can see the doll's craftsmanship is exquisite, but its visual design begs to differ. This sly look and eyes brimming with wit... Do people really like characters like this?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ignore it
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You decide to ignore this monkey like you would ignore an insignificant pebble, a stray wind-blown leaf, or a roadside trashcan...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Hang on. You've never ignored a trashcan.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Talk to it
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You try to communicate with it, an act that would be slightly silly in other worlds, yet so reasonably normal on Penacony — which fan of Clockie hasn't had a heart-to-heart conversation with their own Clockie doll?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Pity that dolls can't talk and can only listen. For someone feeling lonely, however, listening is already enough.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Punch it
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You administer a swift punch to the monkey's face, its soft texture enveloping your fist. The monkey's visage accepts your anger — you definitely hit cotton.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You retract your iron fist imbued with the Trailblaze power, but its expression remains unchanged. You have struck it with violence, but it responds with a smile.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: It silently sits in the middle of the room, mute and stoic. Looking at its dumb face, a voice inexplicably reaches your ears... "bana"?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Penacony Paperfold University College
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Well, this place sure is sealed off.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: No other way...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: I have to borrow your bed...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Please forgive me!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: ...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Security System]: Focus on your breathing and imagine you're in paradise... Imagine... an... island...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Security System]: An... island... island... island... island... island...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkey]: Bana, bana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: There are monkeys in Penacony!?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Is this really Paperfold University?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Where did the Dreampool send me?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkey]: Baaaananana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: The monkey in front of you keeps making Banagibberish sounds, reminding you of the film you just watched. Oh, what an entertaining one that was! Do you remember how the theme song goes?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkey]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Yep, that's the tune! Let's sing together and open the door to a new world—
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: : ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Fantastic! You're a born Banagibberish singer!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I'm not singing!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You are a resolute Nameless, of course you would refuse such an invitation. But when you open your mouth, what comes out is—
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: : Bana bana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Who are you?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Me? I'm the weary soul on your arduous journey, the longing for a moment of rest.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Look! Your Banagibberish has attracted more adorable monkeys.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkeys]: Bana bana bana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkeys]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: What a wonderful yet harmonious atmosphere! No matter what, you should join in, embrace the pleasant Banagibberish and the scent of bananas from the little monkeys—
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ba na na na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ba na na na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ba na na na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ba na na na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ba na na na~
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: : Bana...
[An Andalusian Monkey][???]: By the Great Lan above!!
[An Andalusian Monkey][???]: A most terrifying close call that was. But fear not! The darkest hour of the night may be upon us, but this majestic skyscraper shall now welcome the start of an epic hunt!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Under starry skies, evil low 'n' high,
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Helpless folk in the dark fightin' for their lives.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Silent ninja arts written down in red tears,
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Noble ninja hearts in the night joined here.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Stormy tides crashin' forth, all evil slain, come the dawn, shining sparks lightin' up again.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Yo yo! Dazzling Ninja, AKA Rappa, nice to meet ya.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: O—Ouch!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: What kind of devious trap is this!? Not only are there fiendlings abound, but there are also concealed weapons flying about!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Who are you?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Greetings, I am the Dazzling Ninja, AKA Rappa.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Your rapping is great.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Rapping? That's not it. What I'm reciting is the mantra of a ninja.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You clearly threw those yourself!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: I'm afraid you're mistaken. You're simply too good-hearted to realize that the fiendlings were manipulating its landing spot with sorcery.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkeys]: Bana?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Be gone, fiendlings! Or I shall give you a taste of my Dazzling Ninjutsu!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkeys]: Bananana! Bananana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: That's... impossible. How can it be?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You understood that?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: What did they say!?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: I... I am unable to communicate with these fiendlings!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: : ...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Don't let this weirdo interrupt your happy moments. Listen, the little monkeys are still joyfully inviting you—
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkeys]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Be on your guard! This is also part of the fiendlings' sorcery! Hang in there, I'll get you out of this right away.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Dazzling Palm: Righteous Chop!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: —Bam!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: How shocking! The ninja strikes your forehead with such force. Its powerful impact reverberates through your body, striking your very soul. In an instant, all your five senses are severed, and the sound of monkeys ceases.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: That hurt!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Well, I'm definitely awake now.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: That almost shattered my Stellaron.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: My humble apologies, Dazzling Palm was designed to deliver a powerful impact to the soul. I've endeavored to control my strength, but some pain is inevitable if I am to ensure your regained consciousness.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Strange Monkeys]: Bana! Bana bana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: The monkeys in front of you have a fierce look on their faces, as if saying, "What the heck is going on?"
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Hmph, showing your true colors now that your evil schemes have been exposed? They're calling for their fellow ape fiendlings. Please take cover behind me!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: They've scampered off in different directions. Those fiendlings are up to no good. We'd better get moving.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Let me leave.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: A wise judgment. You have the aptitude to become a ninja master too.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I don't want to leave yet...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Are you still under their spell? Or has the ninja power of my Righteous Chop dissipated? Fear not, I can do it again!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: No thanks. Let's get going.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Who exactly are you!?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: I never leave a question unanswered. I am a ninja, AKA Rappa.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "Be decisive, lest we be overwhelmed by the consequences." There are still fiendlings roaming nearby. Let us be on our way.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: You are indeed.. ...dreaming.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Dazed Monkey]: Bana bana, bana bana...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: This monkey looks just as dazed as the ones you saw earlier. If you stare at it for a few more seconds, your intelligence might be affected.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: If you look closely, you'll see that its eyes don't reflect your image, but instead... a giant banana?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Stop, don't look any longer.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Focused Monkey]: Bananana... Bananana!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: This monkey seems to be teaching other monkeys, but you can't understand their Bananese — let's hope you don't feel the same way in your classes at Paperfold University.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: You can return to a safe location after touching this object. "Pinecany" truly is filled with boundless mysteries.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Since fate saw fit to bring us together, may I know your name before we part ways?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: .
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: I am the Galactic Baseballer.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Ninja .
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: A strong name! Well met, Baseball Bat Ninja!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: That's not what I said!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Eh... Close enough.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Well met indeed, Dazzling Ninja!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: Forgive me for speaking out of turn, Baseball Bat Ninja. But for your safety, you and your companions should leave this land of dreams as soon as possible.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: The appearance of these fiendlings are a sign of impending disaster. It is proof that the Ninja Hero's archenemy has their eyes set on the land.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: The emotionless, soulless, and merciless Evil Ninja Osaru.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Who?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Huh?
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: What the...
[An Andalusian Monkey][Rappa]: It is time for me to depart. Please do take care. Goodbye!
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Lightning fast! Before you finish speaking, the ninja has already leaped into the dream bubble and vanished without a trace. It all happens so quickly that the average person's eyes can't keep up.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: :
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: Enter Dream Bubble.
[An Andalusian Monkey][Narration]: You gather your courage and climb over the railing, entering the monkey-shaped dream bubble...

[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Previously on Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: A long, long time ago in a world far away, there was a city that flourished under the rule of a Ninja Hero for many generations. It was known as the Ninja Capital.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Under the protection of the Ninja Hero, the people of the city thrived. They lived and worked in peace and happiness could be felt even in the sewers of the Ninja Capital.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Until an evildoer known as Evil Ninja Osaru murdered the Ninja Hero and laid claim to the city. The happiness of days past disappeared in an instant.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: 56th Year of Ninja Era, the Ninja Capital
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "The galaxy is vast beyond compare, containing an infinite number of possibilities."Our community needs more information on this page! Can you help out? Click here to add more. The reason provided was:Missing animation/image
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": O child new to the way of the ninja, I recognize your determination. Henceforth, you shall be the successor to my Dazzling Ninjutsu.
[The 400 Bananas][???]: Thank you, Master Kucha. This is my greatest honor.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Behold the city of shadow! A sinful land of suffering, hatred, and sorrow. Bloody tears soon to devour all hope for the morrow.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Soulless Evil Ninja Osaru, agent of the vile, cast the masses into sin by foul arts and guile. Fiendlings indulgent in evil gone wild, enraged the hearts of all — man, woman, and child.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Inherit the legacy of the Ninja Hero and wipe clean the sins of Osaru. End the suffering wrought upon the Ninja Capital and bring peace back to its people.
[The 400 Bananas][???]: An astounding recitation of the ninja mantra, Master Kucha! I swear I will train hard until I become the Dazzling Ninja!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": An admirable resolution! To contend with the Evil Ninja, you will also need a new name — a name befitting a ninja.
[The 400 Bananas][???]: What should I be called?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I don't know, my disciple. Your name will carry your ideals, your convictions, and your destiny. Your ninja name belongs to you alone.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Master Kucha": So, the decision is yours to make.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: :
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: ! We're over here!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: , you're late! Did you run off to Aideen Park with someone to clown about again?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I met a lot of monkeys...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I met a ninja...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Bana bana...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: You tell everyone about the strange dream you just had...
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Monkeys and a ninja... That doesn't sound like something that happened in Penacony. Seems more like a dream bubble.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Uhh, those monkeys you were talking about... Is that them?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: There are monkeys here too!?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: That's them!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Am I still dreaming?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I knew you had to be talking about Slumbernana Monkey.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Slumbernana Monkey?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Allow me to introduce you to the most popular little guy in Paperfold University! It's more beloved than Clockie.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Slumbernana Monkey likes goofing off and loves eating bananas. It lives a carefree life in the Moment of Slumbernana.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Is it also a cartoon character created by the Watchmaker?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: No, no, it only appeared recently. It's a... What's it called again? A me... A meme!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: No one knows where it came from. It just blew up overnight. Fans made up Bananese that only fellow fans would understand, and even created sticker packs and fan works!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: The most popular one is the Slumbernana Song. ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: That sounds really odd.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I guess it is a little odd, but abstract ideas are always the easiest to spread around.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: You're really up to date.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Heehee~ Of course! I'm a college student who keeps up with the times.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I don't want to listen to it anymore...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Oh? You know the song? Not bad. You're keeping up with the trends.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: How do you know so much?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: From the campus group chat, of course. I joined the group before school even started so I'd get to know more people. That's just common sense.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: You'll have a hard time making friends at school if you stay out of touch. Here, I'll add you two to the group.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: It's almost time. Let's proceed to admissions.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Come on, let's go! A spectacular campus life awaits us!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Why is The Family running a school in a dream anyway? Do people really come to the Planet of Festivities just to study?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Paperfold University was established during the Pioneering Era. It was initially a training ground for Dreamweavers and was founded by Glaux, head of the Nightingale Family.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Later on, the Iris and Alfalfa Families also got involved in university operations, and the education landscape expanded into the three academies we have today: Dreamweaver, Charmony, and Fortune. From there, Paperfold University became known as the top arts school in the cosmos.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Wow! Is this really a school? It looks grander than the theme park!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Paperfold University's motto is "Color your dreams, free your ideals." What we see before us reaffirms those words. We still have some time before the anniversary celebration's opening ceremony. Let's take a look around.
[The 400 Bananas][Strange Troupe member]: Hello, new students! How are you?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: What is that!?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: That scared me!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: It sure looks unique.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Dreamjolt Troupe, prepare for combat!
[The 400 Bananas][Assistanana 416]: Did I scare you? Sorry. I'm Assistanana 416 from the welcoming committee!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Assistanana? Like a teacher's assistant?
[The 400 Bananas][Assistanana 416]: It's Bananese. Students are in love with Slumbernana Monkey right now, so our faculty did our homework and changed up our image, bana!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Why are the faculty in Paperfold University from the Sweet Dreams Troupe?
[The 400 Bananas][Assistanana 416]: Most of the teachers are attending the academic conference during the school's anniversary. That's why the dean asked the Sweet Dreams Troupe to be substitute teachers, bana.
[The 400 Bananas][Assistanana 416]: Don't you worry. The BananAdvisors come loaded with the memories of the senior professors. Our banacademic standards remain top-notch. There's no need to worry about studies right now though. Please enjoy the Dreamlight Anniversary first, bana!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I sure will! I wasn't planning to study anyway!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: That's a bold declaration.
[The 400 Bananas][Assistanana 416]: Haha, that's alright! Paperfold University is a school of freedom. Spend your youth however you'd like!
[The 400 Bananas][Realistic Monkey]: Bana!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Ooh! Slumbernana Monkey is so cute!
[The 400 Bananas][Passionate Banana Fan]: Oh, are you Slumbernana Monkey's Ripe Banana too?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: You could say I'm more of a Fresh Banana than a Ripe Banana. Is that a plush next to you?
[The 400 Bananas][Passionate Banana Fan]: I bought this from the Creator's Market. Doesn't it look realistic? The booth owner said this design is especially popular and really hard to get.
[The 400 Bananas][Realistic Monkey]: Ba, Bana bana!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: So cute! I want one! I'll go take a look when I get the chance.
[The 400 Bananas][???]: You there, please wait a moment!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Huh? Are you talking to us?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: And you are...?
[The 400 Bananas][???]: You guys were easy to spot. You, the pink pretty girl with the camera, you're Say~Cheese~, aren't you?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Yes, that's me.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Hey, stop messing around! She was looking for me!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Pretty girl?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Got a problem with that?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Say~Cheese~?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: That's me. I heard college students love nicknames, so I decided to go by my online handle.
[The 400 Bananas][Montana]: Hi there! I'm TreasureNana from the campus group chat. You can call me Montana.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Nice to meet you. My name is Dan Heng.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm .
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I am the Galactic Baseballer.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm Baseball Bat Ninja.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: ...When did you start going by that name?
[The 400 Bananas][Montana]: Oh gosh, I recognize you! You're this season's Festive Superstar! You're famous!
[The 400 Bananas][Montana]: I never thought I'd go to the same school with someone famous. I bet you'll be assigned to the Charmony Academy!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Assigned...?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: It refers to the "Tuning Test." At the entrance ceremony, The Family's Members will analyze the potential of students through "tuning" and assign them to the appropriate academy.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: No one said there'd be an exam!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm dropping out. Bye.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Dan Heng, can I copy your answers?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Calm down. It's not a real exam.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Hmm, The Family assigns every student their major? Doesn't sound very "harmonious" to me.
[The 400 Bananas][Montana]: Don't worry. If a student disagrees with the result, they can apply for a transfer to another academy. It's just that most people don't.
[The 400 Bananas][Montana]: The pressure is high even in a dream. Not to mention competition has grown fierce ever since Penacony relaxed their entrance reviews after the place went public. Most of us are just grateful The Family is willing to guide us.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: That's reality for you...
[The 400 Bananas][Montana]: Anyway, let's change the subject. Are you going to attend the dean's speech? My friends and I are going to check out the Creator's Market, so I won't be joining you. They're not taking attendance anyway. See you later, bana!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: The teachers and students here sure are unique.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I am too!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I have social anxiety.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: No one's going to buy that. You're never afraid of anything.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: How do you do, fellow student?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Alright, you old fogy.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Look at the time. The anniversary celebration's opening ceremony should be starting soon. Let's go see the dean.
[The 400 Bananas][Curious Student]: Look, the dean is going on stage.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Wha... No way. The dean is...
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: ...
[The 400 Bananas][???]: Hello, students. Or should I say, bananjour?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: What's going on? Is this a gag?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: The dean is a monkey?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: That's just a mascot head, right?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Is the dean supposed to be this unserious?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Bananana!
[The 400 Bananas][Shocked Student]: Look, it's Slumbernana Monkey!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": I'm Professor Primon. You may also call me by my more fashionable moniker — Profnana.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": Haha, did I surprise you? Don't worry, students. I've not gone mad. The reason I'm appearing before you like this is to show our new students the ethos of Paperfold University—
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": "Color your dreams, free your ideals"!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": A lovely aspiration, but I hear that the words ring hollow nowadays. The pressure of schoolwork has kept all of you from looking up at the beautiful starry sky of the Dreamscape.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": "My schedule for the semester is packed. All I do is eat, study, and sleep. It's so hard to prepare for my thesis defense. I'm stuck on my thesis..."
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": My dearest students, this is not the way. This is not how youngsters in the Land of the Dreams should behave. So today, I bring you good news.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": After some discussion, the teaching research team has come to a unanimous decision to cancel all courses and exams for this semester. Everyone who attends the school anniversary will earn their credits.
[The 400 Bananas][Fellow Students]: Seriously!?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": Yes, do not doubt your ears, young ones. Freedom — This is what Paperfold University yearns to teach you.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": Leave your worries over school and life behind and express yourself! Spread the love of your favorite things, such as Slumbernana Monkey, to every corner of the campus!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Profnana": Welcome to the Dreamlight Anniversary! Color your dreams, free your ideals!
[The 400 Bananas][Fellow Students]: Color your dreams, free your ideals!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Woah, the hype on campus is real!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Looks like Paperfold University is more open-minded than the rumors say. It really suits Penacony.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: The Tuning Test is up next.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Let's go. The waiting area is in the open classroom.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Here we are. There's so many people. Is everyone here for the exam?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: The student has a pained expression, as if something is troubling him.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: It might be that he emptied his savings to pay tuition, or that he discovered that the cafeteria food at Paperfold University isn't great, or that he found out that the girl he had a crush on when he first enrolled is holding an upperclassman's arm.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Are you okay?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Bro, are you all right?
[The 400 Bananas][Vexed Student]: ...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: This guy doesn't acknowledge you. It seems like his endless troubles have shut him off from the world.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Just like how every teacher has endless principles to share, every student also has endless worries — but don't worry. Once they start working all day long, they won't have time to worry.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Haha, this is so embarrassing...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Actors, settle down, settle down.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Please quiet down,
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Get back to your seats,
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Turn off all recording devices...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Get ready,
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The film is about to begin.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hello, cast members. I am your director for this exam. You may call me Mr. Reca. It's the name I commonly use in the end credits.
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: Mr. Reca, please mind your verbiage. You're not on set. This is a classroom.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: No good! Cast member of The Family, do remember that everywhere I stand is a set.
[The 400 Bananas][Shocked Classmate]: Oh my gosh, it's him! It's Mr. Reca in the flesh in the school!
[The 400 Bananas][Excited Classmate]: Mr. Reca! I am your biggest fan!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: CUT! Cast members, please remember your lines. I'm currently playing the role of a guest lecturer and you are my students. Please stay in character.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: This guy looks familiar... Oh! I think I saw a picture of him in the Blue Hour. He's a really famous director, I think.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Mr. Reca. He's known for works such as Soul-Shattered Dark Star, A Fading Nebula, and the famous Nights of Minyatur.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Huh? I thought you only watched documentaries.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: His works are based on real life events. They are worth referencing.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Let me see what the script for this scene says: The examiner presides over the exam as The Family tunes the students to discover their talents within their soul's melody...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: ...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Boring. I'm changing the directions of this scene. Cast member of The Family, that's a wrap for you.
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: Wh—What? But tuning is the most important segment of the Tuning Test...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Huh?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Miss Sedina, in your thirteen years and four months of teaching, you've committed seven counts of academic fraud. It seems your laziness has turned your artistic integrity into a pile of decaying film.
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: Academic fraud? What are you talking about...?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: This scene will determine the students' very futures, yet your academy would have me produce such slop? It's no wonder the Iris Family hasn't produced a good film in centuries.
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: Enough! You're only here as an examiner because of the acting dean! You can't dictate what we do! According to academy regulations...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: According to academy regulations? Think carefully now, what do the academy regulations say exactly?
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: The academy regulations very clearly state that the examiner's word is law in the examination room, so...
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: Wait, but you're the examiner! What's going on here?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Good, you finally connected the dots. On my set, the director's word is law.
[The 400 Bananas][Family Member]: Uh... Huh?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Members of the cast, I've reached a consensus with the producers. This exam shall now be an audition.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Are you ready? I will surely find the perfect role for you.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Mr. Reca is so amazing. He convinced The Family so easily.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: That Family Member's reaction was strange. It's as if she suddenly changed her mind.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: That's what I thought, too.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Maybe she was just in awe of the director's aura?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: It sounded like blackmail.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: You mean the "academic fraud" Mr. Reca mentioned? I can't believe that sort of thing happens in Paperfold University, too.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Could Mr. Reca be using Clockwork?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: It looked similar, but it can't be, right?
[The 400 Bananas][Student Volunteer]: Hey, student with the gray hair, it's your turn! Go to the performing arts classroom.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: It's finally your turn! Hurry and go! If you finish early, don't forget to tell us how it went!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: It's finally your turn! Hurry and go! If you finish early, don't forget to tell us how it went!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: , welcome to the audition.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The audition process is simple. You need only answer a few questions. Of course, I won't be judging based on your answers alone. I will be watching your every move on camera.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I know you're Penacony's Festive Superstar, so I expect you to show me what you're made of.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Scene 1 Take 1, ACTION!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hm... This doesn't look right.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: CUT! Assistant director, change the scene, please.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Okay, that'll do.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Let me see here... Perfect! You're born to be a performer!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Thanks for the compliment.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: You're welcome. And you're very polite. Good etiquette can get you far in this industry.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Of course!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Heh, you're confident. Good. A confident performer tends to delight the audience with surprises.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: How do you know?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Knowing how to read people is a basic skill for a director. The way a performer speaks and behaves reflects their personality. For example, you expressed curiosity just now, which is a driving force for learning.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Now, for the first question: Please, introduce yourself.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm one of the Nameless on the Astral Express.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Mm-hmm, that is indeed an important aspect of your identity. A very honest answer.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I am the Festive Superstar, a shareholder of Penacony.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Emphasizing your most respectable status to demonstrate your personal worth. Very astute.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I am Galactic Baseballer, AKA Baseball Bat Ninja.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Haha! Joking with the examiner during an exam. You have a desire to perform.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Okay, second question. What are you most proud of about yourself?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm willing to put my life at risk.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Oh, I get what you mean. The ability to not shy away from danger can bring great value when film-making.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I can take a beating.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I suppose you mean you're in good shape? Yes, the cast welcomes newcomers who are hardworking and persevering.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm thick-skinned.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Very good! Staying calm and sanguine is essential when you're on stage. It is a talent most performers yearn for.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Now, for the third question. I'll let her do the honors.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: This is my assistant director. A reliable partner who's skilled at cinematography, script supervising, editing, and more — has a better eye than me when it comes to casting performers.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Assistant Director": ...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hmm, a very perceptive question. , how do you respond?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: She didn't say anything.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The camera can convey everything in place of words. Her silence is a question and your reaction is an answer. You gave a logical answer.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: She's very cute.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Ooh, you were tactful in the face of someone making things difficult for you. However, the assistant director doesn't like to be praised for her appearance.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Assistant Director": ...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Fine, pretend I didn't say anything. She's very happy with your praise.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Quack, quack!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: "Assistant Director": ...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hah, you amused her. A humorous performer indeed.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Now, the final question...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Nameless, your memory began onboard a station of Erudition, where you then boarded a train of Trailblaze. In your journey, you witnessed the will of Preservation, the determination of The Hunt, and the dispute between Harmony and Order...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: You ran across many different sets and witnessed many different stories. Did you find a theme or perhaps a dream that belongs solely to you?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: How do you know so much?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: It's only natural for a director to familiarize himself with a performer's resume before an audition.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Yes, I found it.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I see. Congratulations on having a clear goal. Your film will surely be a hit at the box office.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: No, I haven't found it.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I see. That's alright. An open theme can encourage creativity.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I refuse to answer.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: A very individualistic answer. You have a style that can hook an audience, just like how you've piqued more of my curiosity.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: CUT! You have finished your exam. Let's take a look at your results...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Most of your answers were calm and composed, like a reliable cinematographer. Combined with your experience in assisting the Architects, the best academy for you is... Dreamweaver Academy!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Most of your answers were clever, like an astute producer. Combined with your experience in dealing with the Interastral Peace Corporation, the best academy for you is... Fortune Academy!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Most of your answers were humorous, like a celebrity in front of a camera. Combined with your experience in winning the Festivity Auditions, the best academy for you is... Charmony Academy!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: What do you think? Are you satisfied with your result?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm satisfied. I'll take it.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Very good. I'm grateful you're willing to listen to your director's suggestions. It's truly an honor.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm not satisfied. Let me choose for myself.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Of course. I respect my performers' wishes. Which academy would you like your role to be in?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Dreamweaver Academy.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Fortune Academy.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Charmony Academy.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I see. Your choice may not be correct but a wrong choice can often make a story more exciting.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The audition is over. You are now a student of Dreamweaver Academy. Here is your student card.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The audition is over. You are now a student of Fortune Academy. Here is your student card.

[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: , can you feel it? The drama concealed within this campus is stirring.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: This is where your story begins. Don't disappoint me or the audience now, my dear leading character.

[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: , can you feel it? The drama concealed within this campus is stirring.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Mr. Reca: This is where your story begins. Don't disappoint me or the audience now, my dear leading character.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Dan Heng and March also finish the exam after some time has passed...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: That Mr. Reca said I'm better suited for Dreamweaver Academy instead of Charmony Academy.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: What's wrong with that?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Is Dreamweaver Academy not good enough?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I really thought I had the acting chops! Now I have to go pour concrete in Dream's Edge. It's not fair.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Did you accept the assignment?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Of course I — did. He was all serious when he said I would encounter a future "full of dramatic tension" in Dreamweaver Academy. It made me really curious.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: It's no skin off my back anyway, so I thought I'd give it a shot. What about you two? What academy did you get?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Dreamweaver Academy
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Wow, that means we'll be schoolmates! Let's help each other out.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Fortune Academy
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Woah, I heard lots of rich people come from Fortune Academy. , don't forget me once you're rich!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Charmony Academy
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: As expected of Penacony's Festive Superstar. I'm so jealous...
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: I'll be going to Charmony Academy.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Oh my, I didn't know you had dreams of stardom, Dan Heng.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: It's because Mr. Reca insisted. He's also a guest lecturer at Charmony Academy. It didn't feel right to refuse.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Alright, alright, I get it. You won over the big bad director with your superstar aura. You don't have to show off.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Anyway, we're finally done with the admission process. Let's go check out the anniversary. How about we start with the Creator's Market that Montana mentioned?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: By the way, Mr. Reca asked me about Belobog. How did he know about that?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: He also asked about the Xianzhou Alliance. Maybe he saw it in the admission documents Himeko submitted.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: But why did she have to mention that I broke the Synthesizer...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Look, there are so many students here! And so many booths. Are they all set up by student clubs?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Let's get something to eat while we walk.
[The 400 Bananas][Timid Classmate]: H—Hello and welcome to the Dessert Club...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Dessert Club? Did you make all these yourself? That's awesome!
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Th—Thank you... I—I'm the club president Chaletka...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I think I've seen your name in the group chat.
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Did you...? I don't really chat...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Sorry, come again?
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Eek! I—I'm sorry...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Bad freshman! Don't bully your schoolmate!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: A foxian friend of mine talks just like you.
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Do they? She must be very troubled too...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: So how much for these desserts?
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: N—No, we're hosting a Dreamscape Patissier Challenge. Students can choose from the ingredients provided by the Dessert Club and design their own... banana pie.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Banana pie?
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Because of Slumbernana Monkey's popularity, all kinds of banana dishes have become popular... Please, give it a try.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: In that case,  can do the design while Dan Heng makes the dessert.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: What about you?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I'll be the taste-tester, of course. You got this!
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: The first thing you must choose for your dessert is... the banana. There are three types...
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: The sour jadegreen banana from the Vonwacq rainforests. The intense bloodthorn banana commonly used as seasoning. And the extinct golden Slumbernana that was once popular across the universe but now only exists in sweet dreams...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Use the jadegreen banana.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Use the bloodthorn banana.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Use the golden Slumbernana.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: :
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Next, we'll add some "emotions" to give the dessert its unique texture. This is also a feature unique to Dreamscape cooking...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Add "Happiness."
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Add "Tranquility."
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Add "Hunger."
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Finally, for added flavor, we have Penacony's sweet dream icing, Asdana's specialty cinnamon, and the hotel's special chili sauce.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Why is there chili sauce?
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: B—Because Paperfold University students come from many different planets. One of the members said they dip everything in chili back at home.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Add sweet dream icing.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Add Asdana cinnamon.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Add the hotel's special chili sauce.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: ...Are you sure?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Don't question the master chef!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Alright.
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: The banana pie is complete. I'll start baking...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: After a brief bake, your banana pie is ready.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: It looks good! Time for the taste test...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Mmm, it's sour and sweet and has the scent of nature.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Woah, it's intense! It's as if something is biting my tongue.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Oh wow, this flavor! I've never tasted a banana this good!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Ahh, this dessert is so tasty. I feel so happy!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Ahh, this dessert is so tasty. I can feel my whole body relaxing...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Ahh, this dessert is so tasty. It gets better with every bite. It's like I can't get enough.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I can still taste the sweetness on my tongue after eating it. Awesome!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: There's also a unique spicy taste, like a warm current spreading through my mouth. Awesome!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: And... Ugh!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: ...And it's really spicy! What did you put in there!?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: It's chili! I put chili in it!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: It's a secret recipe from Jiaoqiu! ‍[Requirement unknown]
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Why you...! Get over here!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: You are pinned to the table by March 7th as she forcefully stuffs the remaining banana pie into your mouth.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: : Spicy...! So spicy...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Serves you right!
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Hehe, looks like March 7th feels very strongly about your cooking.
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: It feels good when you create something that touches another person's heart, whether it's desserts or weaving dreams.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: You're a senior in Dreamweaver Academy? I'll be going there too! I'll be sure to ask if I have questions!
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: Q—Questions? I'm not that good... You should ask them in Dreamweaving class...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Huh?
[The 400 Bananas][Chaletka]: No, nothing... Feel free to visit the other booths. I hope you have a good time.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Oh look, it's Slumbernana Monkey!
[The 400 Bananas][Passionate Classmate]: Welcome, welcome! Welcome to the Toys and Models Club!
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Oh, it's you guys! I'm Peelin' Richie from the group chat. You can call me Richie!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: You know us?
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Of course. You're the Festive Superstar, the Nameless, and Penacony's shareholders! Don't underestimate Fortune Academy's intelligence network. The Paperfold forums were filled with all the latest scoops before you even walked through the school gates.
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Someone with your eminent status must have a keen eye for consumer products. Let me introduce you to the Toys and Models Club's bestseller — the Slumbernana Monkey Figurine!
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Behold the intelligence in its eyes, its soft lustrous fur, and its lifelike appearance! It's just like having the real Slumbernana Monkey!
[The 400 Bananas][Slumbernana Monkey]: Bananana! Bananana!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: The toy talks?
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: This is the Dreamscape. A regular toy won't draw the eyes of the consumer, so Fortune BananAdvisor allowed me to add a little memoria to it. Look, isn't it as realistic as a Memory Zone Meme?
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Well... I should let you know, there's only one left in stock, so act now and don't miss out! Only 8,800 Alfalfa credits! It's duty-free and has a six-month warranty. We also support payment with credits!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'll take it.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Ahh! You called it before me!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: You don't have money... Let me buy it!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: No sale.
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: This is a top-selling product, buddy. If you snooze, you lose.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I'll buy it. Give me one!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I want a discount.
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: This is the lowest price, buddy. You can't even buy a meal in the Golden Hour with this amount of credits.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Fine, I'll take one.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Still not buying.
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Huh? Please don't! This is really important for me! Please, buddy, just one? Buy just one?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: I'll buy it. Give me one!
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Wonderful! Thank you for your purchase! Now I can afford living expenses this month...
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Hurry and give us the monkey already.
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Haha, the demand is too high right now. The toys you see here are all pre-order samples. There's still some time before the products officially ship.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Why didn't you say so earlier?
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: It's customary for new products to be available for pre-orders only. My apologies.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: You cheat!
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: No, no, no! I wouldn't dare cheat you, buddy! Pre-orders are essential to ensure demand is met. If I didn't do this, some buyers would be missing out.
[The 400 Bananas][Richie]: Don't worry. Once the product leaves the warehouse, I'll contact you... No, I'll personally deliver it to you!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Forget it. Let's visit the other booths.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Hm? Why is there a crowd blocking the way?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Hi, excuse me. Can you move out of the way?
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Wait, don't go there. The Disciplinary Committee is searching for a student who broke school rules.
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Huh? Where's your school uniform? You're getting a demerit!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: We're new students.
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: New students? Then remember my face well. Be on your best behavior when I'm around!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'm new. Give me a uniform.
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: School uniforms aren't free! Go buy one from the faculty office!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I don't wanna wear one, so there!
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: A rebel, huh? What's your name? Which academy are you from?
[The 400 Bananas][Disciplinary Committee Member]: Wait, president, I've read about them on the Paperfold forums. They're the Penacony shareholders who have come to visit...
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Wh—What? Penacony's shareholders!?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: We're trying to keep it on the down-low.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: That's us! The shareholders!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: You flash a smile, your lips curving more than a banana, like a storm cloud looming, making the Disciplinary Committee students tremble.
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: My friends, I was just kidding earlier. Please, you three can go wherever you like. If the booths up ahead aren't enough, why don't you come visit my dorm? Or my home!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: This one's attitude changed faster than the people you use Clockwork on...
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: What's going on with the student who broke school rules?
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: There's someone acting suspiciously and leaving graffiti on campus. They're dressed oddly, wearing a glowing scarf, and speaking nonsense...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: A familiar description...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Could it be...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: How did she get here?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Um, is that the person up ahead?
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: *Academic vulgarity*, it's her!
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Found you! You're not getting away this time!
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: ...Ninja Initiate Gigaku, it seems our time for rest is coming to an end.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: You're right, Dazzling Ninja. They are the warriors of this land... No, they're the evil spirits drawn to our sins.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Lamentable... My ninja speed isn't fast enough to outrun cause and effect.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: The ninja's blade can and must sever the chain of cause and effect!
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Your determination is admirable! Ninja Initiate Gigaku, you have already stepped into the Ninja Hero Domain.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: Do you hear that? Evil spirit, be reduced to ashes before our ninjutsu!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Huh? Are we going to fight!?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: ...
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: What are you waiting for, warriors? Fight us!
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Unbelievable... You from the Performing Arts Club! That woman next to you is in big trouble. Don't become an accomplice!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: So this is the booth for the Performing Arts Club.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Ninjas? Why are there ninjas?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Am I still trapped in that dream bubble...
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: Aw, come on, just play along! The camera was rolling!
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: So, is she a member of your club?
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: No, I think she came from outside the campus, but look how in-character she is. She's perfect!
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Shouldn't that arouse your suspicion?
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: My meeting with Ninja Initiate Gigaku was purely happenstance, but I did not come here alone. These Nameless Ninjas are also my companions.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: That's me!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: What the?
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Uh, do you know her?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I suppose.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Not really.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I wish I didn't.
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: So she's a friend of the shareholders. That explains her behavior.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Hey, what do you mean by that?
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: Since you're a visitor, I'll let you off this once. Don't break school rules again.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: Hah! The tyrannical official retreated in the face of such extraordinary fighters! Victory for the ninjas!
[The 400 Bananas][Head of Disciplinary Committee]: You, put on your school uniform or it's a demerit.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: Huh?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: The individual who claims to be Ninja Initiate Gigaku has been detained by the head of the Disciplinary Committee...
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Baseball Bat Ninja, it is good to see you again. This must be a fated reunion!
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: It is a pleasure to meet the both of you as well, Nameless Ninjas. I am Rappa, AKA the Dazzling Ninja.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Nameless Ninjas? Are you talking about the Nameless? We have names, you know. I'm March 7th and he's Dan Heng.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: What strong names! Greetings, Ninja Ruri and Ninja Hiryū!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: ...
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: My name is Dan Heng.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Understood, Ninja Hiryū Aoi Dan Heng.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Um... She's taking this really seriously. Is this what people call chuunibyou?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Maybe she's a Riddler.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I see hints of the Knights of Beauty.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Fudge me, a Galaxy Ranger?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Strange things happen across the cosmos. Maybe a Ninjutsu Planet does exist.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Is she the ninja you saw in your dream?
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Indeed. Baseball Bat Ninja and I are comrades who will risk life and limb for one another. We were besieged in the fiendling fantasia and survived together.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: It's not nice to eavesdrop on conversations.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: A ninja's super hearing can capture even the death of a proton. You spoke loudly before me. I wasn't eavesdropping.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: You claim to be our companion, so it's only reasonable to ask that you state your identity and purpose.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Of course. That is exactly why I'm here. But before that—
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: There is still justice to be upheld. I must prioritize assisting that cause.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: Stupid student council. This is discrimination.
[The 400 Bananas][Gigaku Ninja Initiate?]: You're still here. Thank goodness!
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Ninja Initiate Gigaku, what ails you?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Stop calling me by the name of my character. Use my stage name — Nanabloom-chan!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Another one from the group chat?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Correct! My nickname in the group chat is Nanabloom-chan !
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Referring to the flowers that bloom on banana trees. They're really pretty!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Why chan?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: A classmate from Tokiwa calls me that. Isn't it cute?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: You know, I just realized how high caliber our new students are this year. Please, you absolutely must take part in the Performing Arts Club's "Paperfold University Superstar Project Photography Challenge"!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: That's a really long name!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: This challenge requires you to take on the role of celebrity models. You'll choose a photographer who will take a photo that meets our requirements. We'll then print it into a photobook and send it to you.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: That sounds great. Let's take some photos together!
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: If it's a trial prepared by Ninja Initiate Gigaku, I see no reason to refuse.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Great! Now choose a photographer among yourselves. This challenge will put the photographer's skills to the test more than the model's!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I'll do it!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Photographer March 7th, you're up!
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: What? Um... Can't you do it, ? Please? I really want my own photoshoot! I'm begging you.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: The ever-reliable Dan Heng, you're up!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: I've never taken photos of other people before. It might be better if you do it.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Photographer Ninja Rappa, you're up!
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: My apologies. I am unfamiliar with this particular ninja tool. It's best I leave it to you.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Then you're in charge of photography. Good luck! As for our prop... Let's use this Slumbernana Monkey toy.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Alright, make sure you get all the models and the Slumbernana Monkey in the shot.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Alright, make sure you get all the models and the Slumbernana Monkey in the shot.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Everyone looks so photogenic, but Slumbernana Monkey is missing from the shot. Try again.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Wow, perfect! I'm going to display these photos at the booth.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Baseball Bat Ninja, your Photo Ninjutsu is exquisite!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: I envy how photogenic you all are. I want to be one of the stars featured in the Scorchsand Audition too...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Forget it. Let's not talk about such depressing topics in the middle of festivities. Here's your photobook. Have fun!
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: No one will bother us anymore. Tell me. Why have you been following us all this time?
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Very astute. It appears you have ninja super hearing too. However, following you was mere coincidence. My purpose for coming here is to set up Dazzling Ninja Seals across the campus in order to dispel the Evil Ninja's matrix.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: Seals? Oh, the grafitti the student from the Disciplinary Committee was talking about.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Cause and effect is a wondrous thing. It allowed me to reunite with you, the Nameless Ninjas. Ninja Hiryū may not recognize me, but he must remember my colleague: A Ninja Hero clad in silver armor. He has a bold, easy confidence, is proficient in the use of bullet ninjutsu, and frequently spouts sweet and melodious words...
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Silvergun Shura!
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Silver who now?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Shura huh?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I think I know who that is...
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: ...Is it Boothill?
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Precisely.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Does that mean you're also a Galaxy Ranger?
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Of course. I didn't want to cause a misunderstanding, so I emphasized the title Ninja Hero.
[The 400 Bananas][March 7th]: They both mean the same thing?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: So we now know who checked into the hotel. But why are the Galaxy Rangers revisiting the Dreamscape?
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: Ninja Hiryū. You and your companions are all elite ninjas who follow the true teachings of Trailblaze. You should know in the Cosmic Ninja Realm, there are many extraordinary individuals like me, but also evil ninjas.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: So long as the Evil Ninja still lives, danger that requires the presence of us Ninja Heroes will never cease. The reason I visit Pinecany is to hunt down one such scoundrel.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: He wreaks havoc across the universe with his fiendlings in tow. He is the enemy of the Ninja Capital and my archenemy — Evil Ninja Osaru.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: ...Do you know what she's talking about?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: I don't know.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: She's playing ninja games.
[The 400 Bananas][Rappa]: I can hear you.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: A historical account of the ninja realm logged in the Ninja Scrolls.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: Forget I asked.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: This is troubling. If she really is a Ranger, we have to take her story seriously. Perhaps something has happened in Penacony.
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Should we take action?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Should we contact The Family?
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Should we run?
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: The situation isn't clear. We shouldn't act rashly. After all, we're currently here as guest students.
[The 400 Bananas][Dan Heng]: It would help if we could get in touch with Boothill. I wonder where he is...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Switching to Boothill's POV...
[The 400 Bananas][Narration]: Unbeknownst to everyone, the cosmic cowboy who became uncontactable is currently lurking in the shadows of the Dreamscape...

[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Sure enough, when I came to, my mind was whisperin': Hatred is the frailty of the weak.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: That's when it hit me. I've got a mind that's still "alive."
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: But if you ask me...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: My muddle-fudgin' brain ain't the boss of me! Or how'd I end up here?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hm?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Forkin' hell...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Jessie]: Pardon me for asking, but this is your seventh drink and you've only had a sip from each... Is there something the matter with them?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Oh, it ain't like that. These little sweet drinks taste pretty good. Ordering a bunch is just a habit of mine.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: No need to worry, lady, you'll know soon enough. I'm headin' out to take care of some business. Keep these safe for me.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I get that I'm supposed to be helping Rappa, but I don't see anything strange going on here.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: I'll ask you one last time. Do you have any taste at all?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: This place is useless sitting here empty. But if we put a Slumbernana statue here and build a plaza, it'll instantly become a landmark of Dreamflux Reef. We'll be able to get ahead of The Family again.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Cautious Townsfolk]: It doesn't matter what you say. You can't just stake your claim on this place. No one's going to accept that.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Then who should we listen to? Micah hasn't said anything! There's no reason to delay.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: I'm going to put this here today or—
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Huh? Who are you?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Come off it, pardner. I aint even said anything yet.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I don't care what beef y'all got, just make way, will ya?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: So what? You hired this guy to be your thug?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Cautious Townsfolk]: No, I don't know this man either. But thug or no, our position isn't going to change.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Then I'm done playing nice.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Forkin' hell, you hard of hearing or something? Do I have to let my gun do the talking?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Alright then! Hope you're ready to get shot.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: There's no need for that, sir. Allow me to apologize on their behalf.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Please, put your gun away. I'm afraid that's too much excitement for those of us who've already "died" once.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...Who are you, now? What kinda show they runnin' here?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Forget it. The world's complicated enough as it is, but my bullets will make things real simple.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Act first, think later. You bet your forkin' bananas I'm teaching all of you a lesson today—
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Wait a sec. The fudge was that?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Bet your bananas? When the bananas did I start saying fudgin' bananas?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Bananas? Son of a banana? What the banana fudgin' sundae?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Micah, I thought you don't get involved in these matters.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: I'm just putting up a decoration everyone likes. I'm not hurting anybody.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: First, I find it hard to believe that everyone likes those monkeys.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Second, I just happened to be passing by. I saw a friend and came to say hello.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Friend?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: That's right. Though truth be told, I don't remember your name anymore. I've met too many people the over last few years.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: But I still remember those eyes — "This is great! Everyone can make their own dreams here." — That's what you said when you first arrived. Your eyes gleamed with spirit.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Don't forget the aspirations you once had.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Do you have to say these things out in the open? You need to fix your bad habit of lecturing people.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: There's a reason why things become popular. You'll understand some day.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: But fine, I'll back off for today. I'll be back. Let's go.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hold on! Banana my sundae... Forget it, guess I could afford to say less.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hey — where you going?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Let them be. At the very least, they harbor no ill will towards you.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: And they certainly don't have the courage to do anything, anyway. Right, Mr. Ranger?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hah. Finally, someone sensible.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: I know what you want to ask. A Galaxy Ranger's gunshot rings loud and clear. And Dreamflux Reef isn't so isolated that we don't hear what's going on outside our walls.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Good to know I didn't waste my shot.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: But I gotta say, I've seen it all now. The atmosphere here is real strange. I mean, statues of monkeys?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: It's just a fad among youngsters. If you ask me, it's even stranger that a Galaxy Ranger is in Dreamflux Reef.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Are you here chasing evil or settling a grudge?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: You don't gotta beat around the bush. Can't you tell by just lookin' at me? Banana picker, everything's bananas.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I came here to help someone and now I'm the biggest ruckus around here. Son of a banana, tell me what's going on with that monkey!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: It wasn't that long ago, but they arrived just as suddenly as you did...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Huh? Did I miss something? Who's they?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: They call themselves Assistananas. They look like the Sweet Dreams Troupe, except much stranger. They came here to advertise something called the Slumbernana Monkey...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Hm... Maybe it's the appearance or the cultural significance. Just like every other thing that was once trendy.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: I don't have an opinion on Slumbernana Monkey. The young people love it. The real problem is the level of fanaticism it creates. You saw the group from before. They grew obsessed with the monkey and formed their own society.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: I think it's called the Slumbernana Association. They run publicity campaigns all across Dreamflux Reef under its banner, and they're not very friendly.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Oh, those self-proclaimed banana maniacs just now? And no one's tried to stop them?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Fads come and go. It's not all that unusual even in Dreamflux Reef, so I didn't see a reason to intervene. Besides...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: For a very long time, this was the only place in Penacony that had some freedom. Some things just shouldn't be changed.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Fine by me. If you won't deal with it, somebody else will. The Slumbernana Association, huh. Appreciate the tip, partner.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: One moment, Mr. Ranger. You haven't answered my question from earlier.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Are you here chasing evil or settling a grudge?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Huh, do I look like some kind of madman to you? The answer is both. Any more than that is none of your business.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: You still worried 'bout somethin'? Tell you what, buddy, go to Jessie's shop next door. There's a tab for seven drinks. Settle that, and consider my behavior here bought and paid for.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: Seven drinks?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: It may not be much, but it's still malt juice. I never break a promise to those who treat me.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: You can bet on that. The first time I met someone like that, I let myself get shot rather than betray them.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Micah]: A fad is just a fad. It always comes to an end. But if you're here for something else, then I won't pry further.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: You're not making things easy here.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: You say you're a Slumbernana Monkey fan, but you can't even answer any of my questions.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Clumsy Hobbyist]: Wait, wait, it just slipped my mind for a moment. I think I got it. Number 20 is... is...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Clumsy Hobbyist]: "May all see the world for what it is: An arc waxing into perfection."
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: What nonsense are you spouting? You'd best go home for now. The events we're holding over the next few days aren't like any other! Jumping on the bandwagon isn't going to nab you an entrance ticket.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: I'm very sorry. We're temporarily closed. A member knocked something big over and we're still cleaning it up.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: It won't take long. You should get your membership card first. It doesn't look like there's a queue right now.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Hold it right there. Here for the Slumbernana Association event, sir?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Got your membership card with you? I'll need your member ID.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: What the banana sundae are you talking about?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Ugh, another bandwagoner. Exit's over there, sir. We don't welcome anyone but true fans of Slumbernana Monkey here.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Listen, buddy, don't make me repeat myself. I love me some bananas. You don't wanna make things more complicated than they need to be—
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: P—Put the gun down, sir! We can talk this out without going bananas. I gather you're keen on checking out the event? Well, that's fine and all...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: But I can't just let you in. If you're really interested, why not start off by learning more about Slumbernana Monkey?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Like that gal from just now? Gotta give a passphrase just to get through this door?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: No, that wasn't a passphrase but an entrance test to become a member of the Society. We're hosting an incredibly important event inside, after all. Everybody wants to be a part of it.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Sounds impressive. Sign me up, pardner.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Uh, it's a lot harder than it sounds. You won't be able to pass the test unless you're an expert on Slumbernana Monkey.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I might as well give it a shot. Gotta be easier than breakin' my way in.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: ...Fine. The Slumbernana Association is always happy to make more friends. Are you ready for the challenge? Now, which of these questions would you like to start with?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Slumbernana Association's membership hierarchy.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Slumbernana Monkey's famous quotes.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Ban on derivative works inspired by Slumbernana Monkey.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Banana my sundae! What kind of questions are these?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Looks like you're completely clueless about Slumbernana. These are pretty much no-brainers, you know.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Sorry, but I can't let you in for now.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Partner, you're in luck. If this were my own business, I'd be makin' my way through by other means. But since I'm just lending a hand, I can't go raisin' too much ruckus.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Okay, we'll do things your way. How hard can a few questions be anyway?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: I'm very sorry. We're temporarily closed. A member knocked something big over and we're still cleaning it up.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: It won't take long. You should get your membership card first. It doesn't look like there's a queue right now.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Carefree Child]: "We run, we stride..."
[Reservoir Monkeys][Carefree Child]: Miss Robin, am I singing it right?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Mm-hmm. You're doing wonderfully.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: That reminds me. Shall I give you a checkup?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: You learn fast, but this is an advanced singing technique, after all. It won't do if you don't take good care of your throat.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Carefree Child]: Is something the matter, Miss Robin?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Nothing's wrong. I was just worrying too much. Everything is looking good.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I can't believe I just ran into a superstar, and in a place like this too.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: It's okay. This big brother here is a good man. Why don't you go and have fun somewhere else for now?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: "Big bother"?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Um... Maybe I should've just kept it at "Mister." Would that have been better?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: In any case, Mr. Boothill, it seems you've put your travels on hold after that incident too. Are you enjoying your time in Penacony?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Enjoying? Hah, more like going bananas! Bananas, I just can't catch a break.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Mr. Boothill, you... Huh? Hang on.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Sorry, please keep still for a moment...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: What in the forkin' hell are you doing?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Fork. Fudge? Fudge! Holy shirtballs, I'm back to normal!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I knew it. There's a noise around Mr. Boothill too.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: "Too"? Sounds like you've encountered this before. So, what in tarnation is going on with all this "bananas" business?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I wish I could tell you, but I still haven't figured out what it is.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I've been visiting this place a lot lately to teach the children how to sing. Giving up one's sweet dreams takes resolve, so it's my wish that music can bring them some solace.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: But as time passed, I started to notice something increasingly off about the Dreamflux Reef.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hmm. Slumbernana Monkey?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: As I expected, it's come to your attention too. The memoria nearby has been mutating ever since Slumbernana Monkey gained popularity.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Even though the noise doesn't cause any tangible impact, it leaves me feeling awfully drained every time I use the power of Harmony for tuning. I can't explain it.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Other than that, I also paid a visit to the Slumbernana Association.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Oh, I swung by that place too. They let you join up?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: They didn't, unfortunately. Anyone who wishes to become part of the Slumbernana Association must undergo onerous entrance procedures before they can become one of them.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Besides, even if I did succeed in infiltrating them, I... would stand out too much. It makes more sense for me to focus on studying the noise instead.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: So you didn't pass the test either, huh. Well, don't change the fact that I still gotta get in one way or another. Got any bright ideas?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I can offer a few ideas on places you can make inquiries at, but why the sudden...?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Is something going on in Penacony?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Long story. I'll fill you in once I have more concrete details. But first, I have to pass that entrance test by hook or by crook.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hmm, making inquiries, you say? Not a bad idea. And heck, why couldn't I be a fan of Slumbernana Monkey? Tough guys exploring their soft side are a thing these days.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: If all else fails, I got an easier solution to fall back on: I can just "borrow" a membership card from those lil' fudgeheads scrappin' over turf earlier. Easy-peasy.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: To be honest, I'm absolutely clueless when it comes to songwriting. This song was taken from somewhere else.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: But the first time I heard it, I knew immediately that it was the perfect song for telling a Slumbernana Monkey's story, so I wrote new lyrics for it.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: This is "The Slumbernana Traveler". I hope you find it ap-"peeling"!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: I've wandered far, I've wandered wide, with Slumbernana Monkey~
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: Its voice so clear, its voice so bright, tells me to remember~
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: When you're tired, take a rest, take a break, it's for the best~
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: "Life grows beautiful for those who will forfeit it all."
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: They're even singing about it now? So, what's your expert opinion on this?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I love it. A song finds meaning in its existence only when it can be sung by anyone and everyone. No matter how hard or tough an ordeal is, it can never take song away from the people.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Extroverted Slumbernana Fan]: "Life grows beautiful for those who will forfeit it all."
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: Welcome, welcome! A Slumbernana Monkey toy for you, mister? I made it myself. Don't worry, I'm not taking any money for it!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Do I look like someone who'd place that monkey beside my pillow?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: Well, you never know! You look really cute, after all!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I... You... What!?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: W—Wait a minute! Am I dreaming? A—Are you Miss Robin?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Hello.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: Oh, my! I was just listening to your newest album! What brings you to Dreamflux Reef?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I've been frequenting this place lately actually. We just hadn't crossed paths until now. Don't worry, you'll be seeing me around these parts for a while more.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: ...After all, the Slumbernana Association's entrance test doesn't seem that easy.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: Th—The Slumbernana Association? Are you planning on becoming a member?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: I must be dreaming! Two of my favorite things together? I must be the luckiest fan alive!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: If it's you, Miss Robin, then of course we must make an exception and let you in!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: You don't have to give me special treatment. I'm just a normal person like every other Slumbernana Monkey fan out there.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: But you know what they say: Good things come in pairs! There's no harm in making a concession sometimes. Here, bring this with you the next time you head over. They'll know what to do once they see it. And don't worry, we're still playing by the book. This is just to keep them from making things difficult for you.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 52 — Monella: Welcome, welcome! A Slumbernana Monkey toy for you, mister? I made it myself. Don't worry, I'm not taking any money for it!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Monkey Fan Creation]: Dreams of Monkeys and Bananas
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: This fan work violates the guidelines for Slumbernana Monkey fan creations due to its exceedingly unsettling nature.Sorry for the violation. This piece wasn't meant for publication, but I really love it, so I decided to share it here.Please don't redistribute this work without permission.You may have come across similar urban legends elsewhere — Dream of the Evil Ape, Scary Monkey Show, or something like that?In those tales, the protagonists often find themselves aboard a public transport vehicle in a dream where an oddly shaped monkey begins a self-immersed countdown, then brutally murders the passengers seated in front of protagonist in all sorts of terrifying ways, row by row.The sheer horror of its means to kill surpasses all possible human imagination regarding torture, instilling a profound sense of horror that jolts the dreamers awake. However, they inevitably find themselves returning once again to that unsettling nightmare, with the menacing monkey drawing ever closer each time...Eventually, the protagonist becomes so terrified of sleep that the story reaches an abrupt conclusion.A friend of mine at the Slumbernana Association experienced a similar dream, but the monkeys in her nightmare were much gentler. They cheerfully distributed fruits to the passengers, their expressions bright and inviting. However, with each iteration of the dream, the number of fruits would increase. Take the apples, for example. That's to say, there is one apple per person in the first dream... then three apples per person in another... and so it goes.You can easily picture the outcome, right? As more and more fruits piled up, someone would inevitably be unable to eat them all. However, the monkeys showed no concern, smiling as they insisted to each passenger, "Be sure to finish them, or something terrible will happen."But how could anyone possibly finish such an ever-increasing number of fruits? In the end, my friend saw the consequences faced by a fellow traveler who failed to eat the fruits.You might think I'm about to recount gory details in a gruesome manner... But what happened was even eerier and more horrific.They're just using every method they can to force their victim to eat all the fruits. Adding it all up in the end, the numbers reach up into the terrible thousands. Ultimately, no one can really say if it was the people that ate the fruits or the fruits that ate the people.It has been three months since I last saw that friend.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Huh? Do you need something else?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Who do I look for to take the entrance test?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Draw your gun and force your way in.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: 
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: No.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Oh, I remember you. Last-minute cramming isn't going to help, you know.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Don't worry, I'm a monkey expert now, about as much as I'm a master marksman. Ask away.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: If you say so... You're taking the Slumbernana Association way too lightly, if you ask me, but here goes:
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: What tiers make up the Slumbernana Association's membership hierarchy?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Human, Denisovan, Ape, Prehistoric.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Forget it. You clearly know nothing about the topic. Come back again later.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Human, Denisovan, Monkey.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Last-minute cramming isn't going to help, you know.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Human, Denisovan, Ape.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Monella referred me.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Oh? Then you must be the one that she was talking about... But why do you look kind of different? Ah, never mind. I suppose I can make things easier for you, then.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Which of the following is most likely to be a famous quote by Slumbernana Monkey?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Eternal life is about being loved in the moment right before death.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: That's totally off the mark. You're just trying your luck, aren't you? I lifted this quote from someplace else.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Glorified the stars may be, yet it is them that light up the dark.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: You seem to have quite the misconception about Slumbernana Monkey.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Life grows beautiful for those who forfeit it all.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Monella referred me.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: (If Monella's reference has already been used
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Uh, do I look like I have such poor work ethics? I heard you the first time.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Bingo! On to the last question now:
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Although the Slumbernana Association has never banned any derivative works inspired by Slumbernana, what kind of derivative works should you refrain from creating?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Illegal stuff.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: I don't think so...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Creepy or scary stuff.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Overdramatic stuff.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Are you serious? No narrative is too dramatic for Slumbernana Monkey, sir.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Exactly! That's the most despicable form of slander.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Congratulations, you've passed! That was impressive! This way, sir.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: Soon, soon. Everything will be set up real soon.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: We welcome you to visit Slumbernana Avenue again for more fun after tomorrow!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Peeved Resident]: No, are you mistaken or something? Coming to my place and then telling me to "make myself at home"?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Peeved Resident]: Who made you owner of this place!?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Is this...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Well, well. Finally found these lil' fudgeheads! And would you look at that? They just don't know when to quit.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Ah, are they the association members going around promoting Slumbernana Monkey? Then that means...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Yep. Hey, we make pretty good partners, huh.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Indeed. We need only sound them out and—
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hey! Look over here, muddle-fudgers!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: ...?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: A little slow on the uptake, ain'tcha? I'm picking a fight here, partner.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Loud, huh? How's that for soundin' em out?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: My apologies, I'll cut back on figures of speech in the future, Mr. Boothill.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: No, wait... Argh... Who the heck are you?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: You need to respect other folks' turf, ya hear?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Listen up. I'm gonna take off my belt and hang it up here. After that, I'll ask a few questions, and you're gonna answer every one of 'em.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: ...Your belt?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Don't mistake me for a fudgin' saint now, you son of a nice lady.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I ain't no greenhorn interrogator, partner. This belt is put here so that ash-voles like you can crawl over and hang yourselves when you can't take no more.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Unpleasant Man]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Pleasant Man]: ...What can I do for you?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hah, I see you finally learned some manners. Now show me your Slumbernana Association ID.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Without any resistance, the man began to search through his belongings.

[Reservoir Monkeys][Pleasant Man]: Here... Take it.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Pleasant Man]: Don't tell me... Was it the Assistanana that sent you after me?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Rack your brain all you want, but you ain't gettin' a word outta me. Now scram.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Huh? Do you need something else?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: I brought my membership card.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Oh? And a genuine article, no less. Let's see, Denisovan 124...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: Mister... Uh, Catherine Marta?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: That's me, pardner. Got a problem?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Slumbernana Association]: Modern 347: No, no, not at all. I've heard that your name and assertive demeanor are quite the juxtaposition, and it looks like there's truth to these stories indeed. Now, if you'll follow me.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: No.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Let's go, partner. Time to see what those troublemakers are capable of.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: ...I'm afraid it won't be wise for us to continue our investigations together, Mr. Boothill.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: What do you mean?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: If you're hoping to keep a low profile, my presence will only be a burden, Mr. Boothill.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Moreover, if you intend to employ... certain means of doing things, it'll be for the better if I'm not around.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hmph, as expected of one in a seat of power in The Family. You're a lot sharper than you let on.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: It's hard to tell what all of this is building towards. It'll be prudent for one of us to stay on the outside.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: Strange. They're linked, but this place... I don't detect any noise here.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: The answer's simple: the gun may fire, but it's the bullet that does the killin'.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: So... Mr. Boothill, I'm familiar with the Galaxy Rangers and their exploits, as well as with the entities they pursue.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: For you to stop here... something must be happening in Dreamflux Reef.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hey, don't be a stranger. You can just call me "partner", yeah?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Monkeys... Monkeys... And more monkeys. They're all muddle-fudgin' monkeys!
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Evil Ninja Osaru, that doggoned muddle-fudger... This is way too familiar a sight for comfort. Things'd better not turn out the way Rappa feared they would.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Gotcha, I'll leave things out here to you, then. Oh, thanks for all the help so far.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: You're too kind. I should be thanking you instead. You have my gratitude for offering your assistance, Mr. Boothill. You live up to the name of a Galaxy Ranger indeed.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Hah, this ain't my turf, so let me just make some things clear.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: I don't give a rat's behind about people doin' good or evil. Whatever's about to unfold in that little club full of shirt-for-brains is no different from the usual stuff I do elsewhere.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Things ain't gonna be pretty, but justice will be served, and that's all I care about.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Robin]: I see... Then I wish you all the best. As for me, I will try to trace the noise to its source. We'll see each other again later, Mr. Boothill.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Fudge me. There ain't nothin' strange about this place at all. These ash-voles are good.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: ...That was quick.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: They aided and abetted the wicked, and deserve their fate.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Well, butter my banana and call me a biscuit, we kickin' off the member initiation rite so soon?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Then bring it on, baby! One ninja's more than enough for this game of infiltration.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Boothill]: Wait a banana... is that... me?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: The bullet will one day find its mark in you.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Just watch, Oswaldo.
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: ...!
[Reservoir Monkeys][March 7th]: Eek! W—Wait!
[Reservoir Monkeys][March 7th]: Ugh, are the consequences of skipping one class that serious?
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: Switching to Trailblazer's POV...
[Reservoir Monkeys][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Previously on Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: To defeat Evil Ninja Osaru, this girl has become the successor to the Dazzling Ninjutsu, adopting the codename of Rappa, she began training under Master Kucha.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: To help Rappa master the secrets of the ninja arts, Master Kucha subjected her to harsh trials. And Rappa, in her quest to liberate the Ninja Capital from darkness, determinedly endured every test.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Master Kucha is aware that Rappa is maturing into a true ninja, and her destined mission will soon unfold...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: 61st Year of Ninja Era, Dazzling Dojo, the Ninja Capital
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Ninja Initiate Rappa.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Yes, Master.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You've trained under me for five years. After rigorous tests and trials, you've mastered hundreds of ninja techniques.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I hereby bestow upon you the title of Dazzling Ninja, entrusting you to be my weapon to defeat the evil ninja and guide the Ninja Capital into the future.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Thank you, Master Kucha. This is my greatest honor.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Take the scroll with you, for within its pages lie the secrets of Dazzling Ninjutsu. It shall cast a brilliance that makes fiendlings fear and destroy the evil ninja's intricate matrices.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Paint it throughout the Ninja Capital. Banish the shadows with ink, and raise the banner against evil.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: What should I paint?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I do not know, my disciple.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You may paint anything that you wish. This is your own ninjutsu.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Master Kucha": So, the decision is yours to make.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: A while ago...
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: , ...
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Stay awake. Don't fall asleep.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: We still can't reach Boothill.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Do you think we can trust Rappa?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: This might sound rude, but the only proof of her being a Ranger is her peculiar behavior.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: But her concerns are valid. I also find the sudden obsession with monkeys to be rather unusual.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Come to think of it, ever since we arrived here, the presence of that little monkey has been making me feel a little unsettled.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Those Assistananas as well...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: And the dean dressed up as a monkey...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Don't forget about my dream.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Let's go and take a look at the classes, shall we?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Huh? I thought all classes were canceled?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: A Dreamweaving class will start soon at Dreamweaver Academy. It's more a part of the anniversary celebrations than it is a regular class.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Slumbernana Monkey's rise in popularity seems quite unnatural. If someone is stirring things up behind the scenes, we need to pay close attention to the actions of the teaching staff.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Sure, we have to attend classes sooner or later anyway. Dreamweaving class is at the Stage Plaza. Let's go take a look.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Look! Rappa's here too. Looks like she's thinking along the same lines as us!
[A Clockwork Banana][???]: You're mistaken! Utterly mistaken!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Slumbernana Monkey is, by no means, an "ordinary cartoon character!"
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Not monkeys again...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Hi, BananAdvisor!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: This style looks so familiar...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Dreams are the canvas of one's subconscious. Within it, even a banana can carry intricate emotions, not to mention the Slumbernana Monkey adored by countless Ripe Bananas.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Yo! Baseball Bat Ninja. Ninja Ruri. Ninja Hiryū.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The Dazzling Ninja greets each ninja present. This action seems superfluous, but is a courtesy that cannot be ignored by a ninja.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: You don't need to individually greet everyone... So, are you also here for the class, Miss Rappa?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Certainly, great ninjas think alike. This "class" dojo seems shady. It harbors fiendlings. Exercise caution, fellow ninja warriors.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Seems like we've got everyone. Alright, let's dive right into our banacademics!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The dreamweaving BananAdvisor sways their head. The class bell rings, drawing all the students around.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Today's session is about "decorating the campus to your liking." Here, grab one of these.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "The galaxy is vast beyond compare, containing an infinite number of possibilities."Our community needs more information on this page! Can you help out? Click here to add more. The reason provided was:Paint can image
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: BananAdvisor hands out a can of spray paint to the students, but you can't feel the weight of the can at all, as if it were empty.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: The materials that form the Dreamscape are completely different from those in reality, and the same theories apply to dreamweaving. What you're holding is memetic dye, which is made from memoria.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Let's use it to decorate this wall, the theme will be everyone's favorite monkey, Slumbernana Monkey!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: So this class is about painting?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: No, no. Dreamweaving is completely different from painting. Let me show you, bana—
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The Dreamweaver BananAdvisor raises the spray can, and colorful ink droplets splatter out. The colored ink seems to come to life, flowing, surging, and blending on the wall, creating ever-changing images...
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Ah! How did you paint that so quickly? It's like magic!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Calm your mind, visualize what you want to create, channel your emotions to resonate with the materials, and there you have it! Your imagination will come to life in the dream. That's dreamweaving, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: I see, bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: March?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Bana?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Uh!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Bana bana, don't worry. Memetic dye can affect the viewers' emotions. It seems this painting has helped you understand Banagibberish better! Great!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: That's it for my demonstration. Who would like to give it a try?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: What's happening? My mouth was running on autopilot. This class definitely seems fishy.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I'll go and investigate.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Hmm... But you'd draw too much attention if you started speaking Bananese too, Dan Heng.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: How about  and I go instead? We're not usually that serious, so even if we mess up, it won't stand out too much.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Let's go.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Great, let's head out.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Who said I'm not a serious person?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Quit the act already. Hurry up.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Can I say no?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Didn't we agree to do a thorough investigation? Let's go!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: BananAdvisor, we would love to try!
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: Me... me too.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Excellent! You can all come up here! Those who excel might even earn some course credits, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Calm your mind, visualize what you want to create, channel your emotions to... what again?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: Slumbernana Monkey... Slumbernana Monkey...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Chaletka has her eyes tightly closed, and her brows furrowed, seemingly focused on her painting. Out of courtesy, it's best not to disturb her.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Bana tsk, go create your own work of art! Don't forget to go bananas with the technique I taught you!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: This pristine wall is about to change, taking on your colors. Just thinking about it makes your tiny hand, clutching the dream paint, tremble with excitement.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: This will be a masterpiece that transforms Paperfold University. To ensure you have no regrets about your youth, you must carefully plan the content of this painting.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: From color schemes to composition, from the big picture to the smallest detail, from concept to design — it deserves not just a system hour, not just a day, but an entire year of meticulous refinement! Make your mark on the history of dream art!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Hurry! Don't dawdle, or the class will be over bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Unfortunately, this clueless monkey interrupted your daydream. But he did remind you of one thing: Time is always the most precious resource in creation.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: You close your eyes, and begin meditating as instructed by BananAdvisor—
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Exactly, think about the things that bring you peace—
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Visualize a starlit sky...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: You remember the vast universe you saw from the train, with countless stars dotting the dark vacuum. Yet, your painting will be even more enchanting and vibrant than that starry sky...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Visualize a beautiful beach...
[A Clockwork Banana][You reminisce about past beach vacations]: the sound of the waves drowning out the noise, seagulls circling overhead, sunlight warming your skin, and a familiar friend handing you a coconut drink...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Hold on, you've never even been to the beach. Where did this memory come from?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Visualize a captivating and profound trashcan...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: You recall the cans you've encountered in the past, their mysterious and beautiful openings like black holes mesmerizing you. Your spirit is drawn into the cans, bringing peace and tranquility to the little trashbag beating in your chest...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The BananAdvisor demands a Slumbernana Monkey, but do you really have to follow it to the letter?
[A Clockwork Banana][Slumbernana Monkey]: Bana bana, bana bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: For some reason, your voice of doubt is drowned out by the Banagibberish of the little monkey. It seemed to be the will of the paint can itself. The sound of the monkey keeps echoing in your ears, and images of the little monkey begin to appear in your mind...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: There's no choice now. It seems your painting will have to be of the monkey...
[A Clockwork Banana][???]: 
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: This is... the Mysterious Trashcan you once helped— it's Shatana! She has subdued the little monkey!
[A Clockwork Banana][Shatana]: Long time no see, outlander!
[A Clockwork Banana][Shatana]: You are our clan's savior and the king-hunter who took away the trash. How could you give in now?
[A Clockwork Banana][Slumbernana Monkey]: Ba! Banana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Shatana]: Shut it, monkey from another land! You can't just break our destined chain so easily!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The power of the can and the monkey battles and merges within you, ultimately channeling into the paint on your fingertips. The scents of bananas and garbage intertwine in your nostrils, while two distinct images emerge in your mind...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Everything is ready! Show your talent and unleash yourself on the canvas of the wall—
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Bana? Completed already? Well, it's just in time. Let's assess your work—
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Ah, this artwork... What a splendid monkey! It looks like it could have been crafted by a master Dreamweaver! You, , are a bananarific genius! A perfect score of 100!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Yes, you've let the little Slumbernana Monkey in your heart consume the will of the can. You've earned praise from the BananAdvisor and admiration from your peers, but you've abandoned Shatana and forsaken your glory as the Savior of the Cans...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: —Is all this worth it?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Ah, this artwork... Your portrayal of the Slumbernana Monkey is flawless, but the addition of the trashcan is too jarring on the eyes. The theme seems unclear. I'd rate it a 60.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Due to the emergence of the cans, you lose a lot of points.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: But that doesn't matter, because your perseverance has brought something far more valuable. One day, everyone will know the story of the cans and understand the deeper meaning of this painting.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Ah, what's going on here? Only trashcans? Where's the monkey? Zero points from me!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Your persistence has come at a heavy price. The BananAdvisor's scolding and the mocking laughter of your peers echo in your ears. You were just drawing what you wanted — did you really do something wrong?
[A Clockwork Banana][Shatana]: Outlander, I'm grateful for the artwork. True dignity lies in staying faithful to what you believe is right.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: —See, you did nothing wrong.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Let's move on to the next student... What in bananas is this?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: March 7th's graffiti wall is as clean as a whistle, but in front of it a huge... Six-Phased Ice appears?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: L—Let me explain...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Ninja Six-Phased Ice! Such formidable ice mastery! Ninja Ruri truly proves her might!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Well, this dreamweaving method feels just like condensing Six-Phased Ice! I can barely tell them apart!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Th—That's impressive, bana! Weaving such a large object in such a short time is comparable to the work of a pro Dreamweaver!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Wow, Mr. Reca was telling the truth! I truly am a genius!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: But I'm giving it a big fat zero!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Why!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: I gave you a theme, and that's Slumbernana Monkey! Not this giant useless block of ice! Even pro Dreamweaver monkeys are expected to follow what is requested of them!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: What even...! The Profnana was just encouraging freedom in the classroom, and you're not even making the slightest effort in your class!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: You're allowed to disrupt my class, and I get to flunk you for that. THAT'S freedom for you. You pay a price for trying to be creative. Now, get back to your seat, bana hmph!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Ugh! How unreasonable!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Moving on to the last student... Hmm? Where's your design?
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: Slumbernana Monkey, Slumbernana Monkey...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Alright, that's enough. Mumbling won't weave you any dreams, you're better off snacking on bananas with that useless trap of yours. Zero points for turning in nothing!
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: Wait, I just need some more time...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Even if I did give you all the time in the cosmos, you won't have anything. Not when you're not passionate about Slumbernana Monkey. Ah... You're at the bottom of the class, aren't you?
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: N—No! ...Not exactly. I was also the second to last a couple of times...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: I'm really sick and tired of seeing students like you. A monkey with no talent for climbing will never reach the bananas. Why volunteer only to embarrass yourself?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: It's better to face reality and give up on this path sooner rather than later, bana tsk.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: That is over the line!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: What do you think you are doing?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: You can't possibly understand the affection in my words. Both you and the other girl have some talent, unlike her. She has no talent whatsoever to speak of.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Pursuing something she can never reach is straying farther from happiness. That's why it's only right to give up, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Have you concluded your articulation, sir?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: If so, please cast your attention this way.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Wh—Wha? Who are you? And when did you get here—
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Wait! What in the bana is this!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: I present to you: the Dazzling Seal. I am eagerly anticipating your appraisal of it, Bighead Fiendling.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Peel that thought out of your head! Is that permanent ink!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: This magnificence is conceived by none other than Patissier Ninja Initiate. At that precise instant you turned around, a look of dawning eureka graced her visage! Inspiration surged through her and this came to fruition in just 0.1 microseconds — imperceptible even with a ninja's hypersight!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: What bananonsense is that!? I know it was you!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: "Cooked salmon cannot swim, just as ninjas never deceive." All Ninja Initiate Patissier needed was a little nudge. I willingly became her paintbrush, to aid her in completing her training.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Is that fair to say, Ninja Initiate Patissier?
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: Huh? Um...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "Pythons slither without feet, as manta rays glide without wings."
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: If your decision is firm, don't hesitate to roar with conviction!
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: —Whatever it takes! I really need to earn my credits!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: That's cheating, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Bighead Fiendling, educators impart knowledge, cultivate skills, and clarify doubts, but they must never deny any ninja initiate of their way of the ninja!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Yeah! You were being way too mean to her. And my Six-Phased Ice is pretty good too!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Grah, you've really banannoyed me, unruly monkey! You barged in here disrupting my class, and now you're even corrupting my students with ruinous ideas!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Get out! Or my iron fists will show you some Bananenlightenment! The same goes for you no-good monkey inciters!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Wh—What's it got to do with us!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Words have consequences...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: What a hypocritical teacher...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Corporal punishment is forbidden!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Alas, the pretense of your tyranny has shattered. With that, a magnificent hunt shall be set in motion!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Give it to them, Assistananas! Show those unruly students what it means to be disciplined, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: You're not supposed to use violence in the classroom!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: It's Bananenlightenment! And violence is one way to enforce that!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Class... d—dismissed...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Now that you are vanquished at our feet, allow me to recite to you the ninja mantra—
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: "Doesn't matter what the rules say, if you bring the violence, then the violence is comin' back your way."
[A Clockwork Banana][???]: Alright, girl... You've already crushed him.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": The university failed to take these BananAdvisors in hand. Please accept my apology for the distress they brought upon you.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Are you perhaps the governor of Paperfold Town?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Governor? You humor me. I'm merely an educator. Here on our campus, our students are the true masters.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": I came over after hearing of a ruckus in the Dreamweaving class, but it seems like it was these Sweet Dreams Troupe who went out of control. My apologies once again.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Pardon me, but I don't think I've seen you around here before. You're not a student of Paperfold University, are you?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": I'm only asking because we know a stowaway has recently snuck into Penacony. Eyewitness accounts from the Bloodhounds describe someone with pink hair, red attire, and a blazing scarf... And you seem to match that description.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: No need to beat around the bush, sir.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Of course. What I'm trying to say is...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": If the stowaway is indeed plotting something nefarious, it wouldn't make sense for them to attend classes at Paperfold University. So, I'm certain you're just an inquisitive student.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Wait, what?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Every banana seedling has the potential to bear fruit, that's why everyone deserves bananenlightenment. Paperfold University advocates freedom in education, so feel free to sit in our classes and be sure to apply yourself!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Join me in a round of applause for our new student!
[A Clockwork Banana][Excited Classmate]: Wow, did you just challenge the BananAdvisor? That's SO COOL! I've always found him annoying!
[A Clockwork Banana][Passionate Classmate]: Why do you call yourself a ninja? Are there really ninjas on your planet?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: R—Rappa...
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: Thank you for standing up for me earlier. Um, could you show me how you did that graffiti, I mean, your ninja move?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: ...That's ninjutsu I learned by myself. It's hard to teach it to others.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: But I say with certainty that you will discover your own way of the ninja someday.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Yes, destiny is no different than a banana peel...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Like bananas within their peels, we can never break free of its encapsulation.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Looks like things blew up real quick... Everyone's flocked here to see what's going on.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The girl stares at the Rappa's painting, seemingly lost in thought.
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: My own way of the ninja...? I don't even know what that is. Maybe I should just practice monkey weaving, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Chaletka]: ...Bana?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: Geez, please tell me they're still duking it out with the teacher!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Hey, isn't that Montana?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: Oh, Say~Cheese~! And Dan Heng and Superstar too! We meet again!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Um... I came up with that name on the fly, so let's forget about it. Just call me March!
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: Gotcha. You can drop "Montana" too! I'm now known as Denisovan 426!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Denisovan... 426?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: That's right, I finally got into the Slumbernana Association — the GOAT club at Paperfold University! And that's my name in the club!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Can't they just call you Montana?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: Pfft! Real names are boring and not special at all!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: What's with Denisovan?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: I don't know, but it was decided by the club. Maybe members in this tier are more capable, haha!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: What does the number mean?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: That's my membership number. Each member has their own unique number!
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: The Slumbernana Association was founded by fans of Slumbernana Monkey. Our fan base stretches far beyond the campus and includes Ripe Bananas from all over Penacony!
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: We create fan art and merch based on Slumbernana, host Slumbernana Cons, and hold a few other off-campus events from time to time. Itching to join us? I can refer you!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! Can you get all of us in?
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: Count on me! It's just that the club has a rigorous screening procedure and we only take in a few members each time. If I refer March in, then the two of you...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I'll pass.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nuh-uh, I'm Clockie's fan!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I need to focus on my studies!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: There's always next time.
[A Clockwork Banana][Montana]: Okie-dokie! This coveted spot will go to March then! Ooh, there's an off-campus event happening later today at a supposedly mysterious location. I can't wait!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Great! Let me say goodbye to those two, and then you can show me where to sign up.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Good job playing along back there, guys!
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Things are getting weirder, huh? This monkey even has a fan club now. But since we have a way to get into the club, I'll go see what they're up to!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Will you be alright on your own?
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Yeah, it's less suspicious than all three of us joining the club together. Let's split up for now. This way, you two can also keep an eye on what's going on in the campus.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Please be careful.
[A Clockwork Banana][March 7th]: Aww, I will. Don't worry about me! You too, . Catch you guys later!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I hope she'll be okay. Profnana was clearly steering the conversation his way earlier. Let's go find Rappa and hear what she thinks...
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: What was that?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...Slumbernana Monkey? I see a tag on it: "Peelin' Richie, Fortune Academy."
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: This is the toy you ordered. It looks rather unique.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: They shipped it out already?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: That store really keeps its promises.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I thought I still needed to pay an extra fee.
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana! Bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: You reach out to feel its quality, but the Slumbernana Monkey is startled and suddenly bolts away...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...It ran off. What now?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Chase after it!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: My 8,800 Alfalfa credits!!! Don't let it get away!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I didn't even get to play with it!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Alright, let's go get the toy back then.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Does this toy... have a life of its own?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Isn't this the way to the Fortune Academy?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Rappa? When did she get ahead of us?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Give me a break, Miss! I'll repeat this for the millionth time: I'm not evil, nor do I sell any gorge roe!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Nay, Ninja Initiate Merchant! The other initiates have verified that these fiendling puppets are from your shop. Confess at once! Are you under the spell of Evil Ninja Osaru?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: It's all a misunderstanding.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: He's hiding something for sure!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Torture a confession out of him!
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Oh! Hey! It's you! Please, help me talk some sense into her. I'm just a well-behaved student working to pay my tuition fees, not whatever "initiate" she thinks I am!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Never mind that. The monkey you sold us keeps running off on its own. Are you sure it's just a toy?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Fiendling puppets imbued with life... The epitome of Ninja Automation.
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: You rich folks are just being unreasonable! If it were really some high-end stuff, would I be selling it at such a low price?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Please, take pity on this poor student! Have a heart! As if squeezing in sales between classes isn't enough, I haven't slept a wink in three days, just so I can get this batch of toys ready!
[A Clockwork Banana][???]: Richie! Bana tsk! How could you speak so rudely to your customers?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: F—Fortune BananAdvisor!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: "The customer is always right!" Did I not teach you that? Greetings, dear students...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: This fiendling assumes the form of an insect-like pest. Clearly a lowly fiendling.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Beetle Monkey!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Monkey Pest!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: True Sting Monkey!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Wh—What did you just say!? Bana grr! Repeat that if you dare!
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Psst, BananAdvisor! "The customer is always right!"
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Ahem, pardon me... My dear students, you may have some misunderstanding about Fortune Academy's new product.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: These monkey toys are made this lively so that they bring more emotional value to our young customers.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Paperfold University might seem to be an enjoyable place, but beneath their peels, many students are in fact bogged down by loneliness. You know... Struggling to embrace the vibrant energy here in the Moment of Sol, but also realizing that they're unable to live as the Penaconians do.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: But the Slumbernana Monkey is the perfect companion! It won't compete for grades, won't compare itself to you, won't use your things without asking. You can trust it completely, without worrying about it sharing your secrets with others. Consider it your bestest palnana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I'm starting to feel tempted.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Is campus social life really that messed up?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Any mention of grades makes me weak in the knees.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bana gosh, look at the time! I have to get ready for my Dreamscape Marketing class!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Excuse me, students. I'll take all other questions after class.
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: I should get to my class too. But do me a favor buddies, just come look for me if you need anything. Let's not involve BananAdvisor again...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I doubt he'll say anything more. Let's just follow him and see what we can learn.
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana bana bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: This atmosphere... is this... really a marketing class?
[A Clockwork Banana][TV Speaker]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Behold, the sensational B-wave that's been raking in all the money these days!
[A Clockwork Banana][TV Speaker]: Eat bananas, nap the day away. Worry no more, be happy everyday!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Now, let's take some time to think about this slogan. What is it about Slumbernana Monkey that allowed it to spark a banana frenzy in Penacony?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: How about that gray-haired student— Wait, what are you doing here!? Oh, never mind. You can answer the question then.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Because Slumbernana Monkey is cute!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bana bana! There's no denying how cute Slumbernana Monkey is, but that's just one of its selling points. More importantly, it addresses the pain point of Penaconian consumers!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Because of its viral catchphrase, bana bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Not quite. While Banagibberish and Bananese helped propagate the banana craze, the key lies in how Slumbernana Monkey addresses the pain point of Penaconian consumers!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Because people want to live like Slumbernana Monkey.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bingo! To live a happy life! That is exactly the pain point of Penaconian consumers!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Both rich and poor alike come to Penacony in the hope of leading a more fulfilling life.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Unfortunately, a couple of days in the Dreamscape is all it takes for them to realize this is nothing more than a fantasy. Dreamchasers soon give in to exhaustion and tourists eventually grow weary from the endless festivities.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Those famed tycoons and Festive Superstars that we pursue lead lives we can never hope to experience... So dramatic, eventful, and out of this world.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: But Slumbernana Monkey epitomizes a wholly different lifestyle! Sleeping and snacking on bananas without a care in the world... This is what pure happiness should be!
[A Clockwork Banana][TV Speaker]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I have just the thing to help all of you understand this better. Fortune Academy students get a bonus discount when purchasing this special model of the Slumbernana Monkey toy...
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: BananAdvisor, I sold everything from the last batch.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: That's fantastic news! We underestimated Slumbernana Monkey's popularity. Come with me, Richie. I'll get you more stock.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: So, the Fortune Academy's supposed to promote these toys. But why did they rope students into their plan?
[A Clockwork Banana][Slumbernana Monkey]: Bana bana bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: It's a shame we don't understand its Banagibberish...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...I have an idea, . Can you use Clockwork on it?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Let me try.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I'm counting on you, bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Will it work?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: We'll find out, but this is one way to confirm some of our assumptions.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Clockwork ninjutsu! Silvergun Shura once recounted its magnificence to me. Please, it will be my honor to witness it with my own eyes.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I'll leave it to you.
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: This dispirited little monkey shows a sad expression, which seems unusual because the monkeys you have seen are always happy.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Here comes the Clockwork!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I need a moment to get ready.
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana, bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Under the spell of Clockwork, the little monkey calms down.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The moment you shut its dial, you seemed to resonate with its calmness. You saw the conveyor belt's boxes, the hesitant crowds in shadowy streets, and... TVs?
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana, bana~!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Under the spell of Clockwork, the little monkey found its smile again.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The moment you shut its dial, you seemed to resonate with its joy. You saw a college acceptance letter, a young person stepping through a campus gate, and a letter stuffed with a few Alfalfa credits...
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana, bana~!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Under the spell of Clockwork, the little monkey began making angry Banagibberish sounds.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The moment you shut its dial, you seemed to resonate with its anger. You saw a disappointing report card, an even more dismal paycheck, and the look of frustration on a young face...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Before you could process these emotions, the little monkey resolutely dashed off into the distance...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: It's working. It seems to be leading us somewhere. Let's catch up.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: It's Ninja Initiate Merchant and Fiendling Pest—
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Hold on. Let's listen in on their conversation first.
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Uh, Fortune BananAdvisor? Aren't we supposed to pick up more stock? I don't see anything here.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Geez, Dreamwaver BananAdvisor said he'd get a new batch ready. Looks like we can't rely on him, bana tsk!
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: By the way, BananAdvisor...
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Did those people... willingly become monkeys?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Why, of course, Richie. Can't you see how happy it is being a monkey?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: I... guess not.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I take it you haven't been paying attention in class, huh? Or did those guest students plant unrealistic ideas in your head again?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Do you have the slightest idea about the backgrounds of those Nameless? You're just a poor student from a faraway fringe planet, one that relies on the IPC for aid! Do you really think you can compare yourself to them?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: ...I know I can't measure up to those bigwigs, but there are things I hope to achieve too...
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I get it. You're aiming to make a lot of money. After all, the sky-high tuition fees at Paperfold University can really take a toll on the average middle-class family.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Oh, I heard your father came to Penacony, too. He's been working day and night ever since taking up a new job at Dawn Factory, hasn't he? Aww bana, how touching!
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: H—How did you know that?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bana bana! He swung by a few days ago to check on how you're doing.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I took the time to chat with him. Looking at how old he is, my heart really went out to him. Throwing in most of his life savings, only to slog his guts out in a foreign land... I could sense his exhaustion and distress.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: So, I instilled in him the tenets of our banacademics, convincing him that becoming a Slumbernana Monkey is the right thing to do. Oh, that's right! He's in the batch of toys that you just delivered. Quite a turn of events, huh?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Wh—What? How could you!
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Could it be... the father of Ninja Initiate Merchant, Merchant Chief?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Why? Because your dad was simply too tired. I asked if he ever had regrets, and he said no. But when I stripped away that banana peel facade, what I found was the expulsion warning letter you had hidden.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Of course, bana... Why didn't I realize this sooner? You're a hopeless student. Rather than squandering our educational resources on you, why don't you become one of Fortune Academy's products? At least scrape some worth out of yourself, bana hyuk hyuk!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I assured your father that you'll get to be happy like him. It's time for you to rest, Richie.
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: W—Why did it come to this!? What use is it for me keeping up the struggle if you've already given up, Dad...?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: Dad, there's nothing else keeping me going...
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: ...Bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Something's happening to Richie! We have to stop him!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Fiendling Pest! What tricks did you pull on Ninja Initiate Merchant?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Gah! How did a ninja get in here!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Get your hands off him now!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I have no hands to begin with, bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Back up! Being this close is bad for eyesight!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: That's not the point.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I want to be a monkey too!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Please see more value in your life!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Hold your bananas, students. Allow me to explain myself.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: I was only trying to help relieve those pitiful kids of their suffering, letting them enjoy the rest of their happy life from a different perspective... And maybe make some extra cash while I'm at it, but this isn't anything new in Penacony.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: You may have your esteemed background and a never-ending supply of credits, but that's not the case for my students. All I did was offer a better alternative, one that both father and son willingly took up.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Seems like a fair and banaworthy deal, wouldn't you say so?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "Sizzling yakitori knows not refreshing ice, as chilled sashimi knows not blazing fire." If Ninja Initiate Merchant has indeed chosen the way of the fiend, it is not my place to intervene.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bana geez! I didn't count on you being this reasonable.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Your words alone will not suffice. Ninja Initiate Merchant, is this truly your intention?
[A Clockwork Banana][Richie]: ...Bana?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: He does not seem capable of a response. Merchant Chief, is this a willing decision of yours?
[A Clockwork Banana][Slumbernana Monkey]: ...Bana?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Deceitful fiendling! You spoke with a forked tongue! They can't prove a word of your claims.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Have you gone bananas!? Monkeys can't speak the human language!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: In that case... Your calling is to render those in misery blind and deaf? Utter absurdity!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: The path to hell is paved with heavenly treasure; devils trying to fool you, better get your head together. The hunters hide greed with a welcoming smile; don't be beguiled, it could be your last mile.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Censure shall not fall upon the ensnared ninja initiate, but the trap's orchestrator ought to be punished. I beckon the Ninja Hunt upon you! Say your final words, Fiendling Pest!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: The banana was that? Assistananas, beat her to a pulp!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: There's no chance those BananAdvisors are actual faculty members... Just what is your goal?
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bana mwuhaha! Why, spreading joy with Slumbernana Monkey, of course!
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Ugh... mole... among us... Deal aborted...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Resorting to sorcery to turn ninjas into fiendlings... Dreadfully horrid.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fortune BananAdvisor]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Looks like he completely malfunctioned.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Something's awry. I believe I should've held back in the ninja battle just now... Perhaps someone is controlling these fiendlings behind the scenes?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I didn't hold back.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: We were supposed to hold back?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Oops, guess I shouldn't have built my ATK so high.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: No matter. The fiendling deserves its rightful punishment. Ninja Initiate Merchant, though...
[A Clockwork Banana][Tired Monkey]: Bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Seeing an additional monkey on the ground, you realize that Richie has already transformed into a Slumbernana Monkey during the fierce battle.
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The two little monkeys gather together, making affectionate Banagibberish. You can't bring yourself to interrupt this heartwarming reunion between father and son.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Ninja Initiate Merchant succumbed to their sorcery. He is expected to be out of action for a while.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Miss Rappa, can we talk about why the Rangers came to Penacony now?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Did you pick up on something, Ninja Hiryū?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Even though I had doubts before, it was only when I saw this that I felt sure of it. The sworn enemy of the Galaxy Rangers, the horrific scientist who transforms humans into monkeys, the Evil Ninja Osaru you spoke of...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: It's Dr. Primitive, isn't it?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Astute. Evil Ninja Osaru... it's definitely Evil Ninja Osaru.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Who?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Is that a yes or no!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Is Dr. Primitive obsessed with bananas?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Member #64 of the Genius Society, Dr. Primitive. No one knows his real name, but his atrocities are infamous throughout the cosmos. The most horrifying one of all has to be his atavistic experiment.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: The dozens of worlds he caught up in this experiment were mostly home to prosperous interstellar civilizations, but every single one of these planets was reduced to a regressed form of intelligence by the time he was done with them.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Intellitrons deteriorated into mere machines, Zatzkas regressed into birds, and even the most ubiquitous human civilizations were subjected to the same fate: millions of apes and monkeys now wander amidst the ruins that they once called home.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: If Dr. Primitive is indeed behind this, we must alert the Astral Express and The Family at once. We won't be able to avert this crisis on our own. Facing such an amoral Emanator of Erudition... even the slightest of negligence could bring unimaginable consequences.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Your analysis is accurate. However, in my humble opinion, now may not be the best time to call the Harmony Shogunate for aid.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "When the net is cast for a catch, ready yourself to land a fish or forgo your net." With Evil Ninja Osaru lurking in the shadows and our locations not yet compromised, I suggest laying low to avoid alerting the monkeys.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Rest assured, I've delegated Silvergun Shura to investigate the forbidden ground. Being the chivalrous and exceptional Ninja Hero he is, I have faith Silvergun Shura will accomplish the assigned mission.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: At this juncture, our priority is to rescue the ninja initiates of Paperfold Town. What Ninja Heroes would we be if left those defenseless initiates to the monkeys? If we don't rescue those before us, how can we hope to save the world?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...Indeed, we must not leave the students to fend for themselves.
[A Clockwork Banana][???]: There you are. I've finally found you, my beloved talents!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: It's... Ninja Gama?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Oh? I see this actor is creative with her words.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Mr. Reca? Do you need our help with something?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Ah, yes. Charmony Academy is filming a promotional video for their anniversary, but the BananAdvisor hasn't found anyone that makes the cut. That's why I'm here: to recruit students with greater acting potential—
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Like you, a big shot with a brilliant past! And you, a superstar that everyone will have their eyes on! And this... actress with personality! Please join us in the performance!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Considering how Charmony BananAdvisor's a creator of the Slumbernana Monkey, I believe only young and talented people such as yourselves will be the ones to catch her discerning eye.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I see. Thank you for thinking so highly of us, Mr. Reca. We'll make sure to drop by.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: That's the way! We'll be at the photography studio. See you later.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Charmony BananAdvisor must be in league with the mastermind behind this. And I can't help but feel like there's more than meets the eye with Mr. Reca.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: I concur with you. Ninja Hiryū is a punctilious ninja indeed.
[A Clockwork Banana][Tired Monkey]: Bana, bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Broken Monkey]: Bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The two Slumbernana Monkey seem to be communicating about something, but it's also possible that they're just making meaningless Banagibberish sounds.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: How lamentable you are! Please, bear with me for now. I vow to defeat Evil Ninja Osaru and restore your ninja forms.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][???]: Fail, fail, fail. You didn't capture Slumbernana Monkey's five parts laziness, three parts cuteness, and two parts playfulness at all!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: But I'm already doing the best I can, Charmony BananAdvisor! It's so hard to play a monkey!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: An utter disappointment to the monkeys. Maybe we should change the cast. Acting skills alone won't cut it. They need to adore Slumbernana with every fiber of their being, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Charmony BananAdvisor, I have a few candidates here. Perhaps they will be to your liking?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Is he talking about us?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Festive Superstar's ready to roll!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Ooh, I absolutely adore monkeys!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Oh? They seem to have potential. Bana bana! I hope you don't leave me disappointed.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: ...Hmm, is this evil fiendling a dragon or a monkey?
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Monkey—no, I mean, I'm Charmony BananAdvisor!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: How wonderful it is to have been scouted by Mr. Reca...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Have faith in a professional director's judgment. Have your scripts ready, actors! Show the BananAdvisor what you're capable of.

[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: What a lousy script...
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Bana tsk, sophisticated masterpieces thrive on simplicity.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Why is everything monkey gibberish?
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Why, Slumbernana Monkey's our star! What else were you expecting? Meows and woofs?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Why aren't there any lines for the villain?
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: All other characters are second to Slumbernana Monkey. They're not important.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Let's assign the actors to their roles then. The leading role of Brave Monkey shall be...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Mr. Reca, I—I want to try this role again!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Bana tsk, your earlier performance was disappointing enough.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: It's fine. Let's give this proactive actor one more shot. Brave Monkey is known for its can-do attitude too.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Next up is Wise Monkey who guides Brave Monkey... Your disposition makes you perfect for this role, Dan Heng.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: As you wish.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: And finally, we have the villain, the Devil of Stress. I'm confident you'll nail it, Superstar !
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: For real? Me as the villain?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Why? Do I look like a devil?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: This character doesn't even have lines!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The role of a conflicted villain requires sublime acting, and improvised lines further demand a robust foundation in the art. You are the only one who can take on this most challenging role.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Not so fast! What role do I play?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Oh, it seems like all the roles have been assigned... But, yes! We'll need someone to narrate! Rappa the narrator, this is your role!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: A lofty Ninja Hero, relegated to the likes of a narrator...? So be it.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: We'll begin once everyone's ready. The assistant director's camera is ready to roll.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: If things play out as I expect, dragon fiendling will let slip her true nature in this class.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Mr. Reca took over the conversation from Charmony BananAdvisor on several occasions to steer the class in a certain way... Did he pick up on something too?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Are you guys ready to start?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Shouldn't we be rehearsing?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: All monkeys share the same line. There's no point in rehearsing.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: I ought to sit down and conceptualize how to incorporate and play up the Way of the Dazzling Ninja in my narration...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: How should I incorporate and play up the Way of the Dazzling Ninja in my narration...?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Charmony BananAdvisor is bound to slip up like the others. Exercise caution.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Ba na na na... Ba na na na~
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana—Oh, it's you, Superstar. I'm so envious of you guys! Being cast in Mr. Reca's film is my ultimate dream...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: You'll get there.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I have faith in you.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Believe in yourself.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Thanks for encouraging me! I—I will keep at it! I should watch the tutorial a few more times...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Ba na na na... Ba na na na...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan kept playing "The Slumbernana Song" on her phone over and over again — given past experiences, you think it's best to leave her be.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Ba na na na... Ba na na na...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan kept playing "The Slumbernana Song" on her phone over and over again — given past experiences, you think it's best to leave her be.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony Academy Student]: Bana, bana bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Hello...?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Um, excuse me...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony Academy Student]: Bana, bana bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: They turned to look at you, but only Banagibberish came from their mouths. Their eyes were filled with pure goodwill, fully immersed in their roles as Slumbernana Monkeys — truly a dedicated group of actors.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony Academy Student]: Bana, bana bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fledgling actors, are you banaready?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Ever-ready.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Then get on stage! Mr. Reca, get the cameras rolling, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Wait a moment...
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Bana? Can't handle the stress? You know you can always throw in the towel.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Actors, take your positions. 3, 2, 1—
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: ACTION!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Dreamscapes glowin', gold halls flowin', a legendary feast's about to get goin'.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Stop! What bananonsense are you reciting!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: This is the ninja mantra. Embellishing words with ninja enchantments is bound to make the play a hundred times more vivid.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: I knew this student wasn't reliable... Forget it. Focus on Slumbernana Monkey only. Nothing else matters.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Then I'll continue— From the hearts of men, monsters arise, the banquet turns to scorched earth, laughter to cries, a passing hero lends a hand, ha — no surprise.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Proclaim your power
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : Behold the Devil of Stress! The Ultimate Master! The Emperor! An indomitable meme! An everlasting nightmare of the Memory Zone!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! Rein in your ego!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Speak the ninja mantra with a wild twist
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : Name's Devil of Stress, straight outta hell, students better quit playin', ring the alarm bell. One word from me, the whole Zone's in despair, leavin' scars so deep,{M# take} a lifetime to repair.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Such a tyrannical rendition of the mantra of the ninja, Baseball Bat Ninja!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! This isn't a rap class!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Brazenly spew swear words
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : I finally get to make a *cosmic profanity* appearance! All you *cosmic profanity* students are a *cosmic profanity* bunch of losers! Yeah, go ahead and *cosmic profanity* remember that! That I *cosmic profanity* cussed at you *cosmic profanity* at your own *cosmic profanity* Paperfold University!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! That's plain crass!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! Brave Monkey is the savior of our university! It would never utter such dainty Banagibberish!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: S—Sorry, bana! Let me try that again. Bana, bana bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Suffering and pain — the fruits of blind hate, a hero draws their sword ready for the fight to break.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: You're messing it up again! Brave Monkey hasn't gained the power to defeat the Devil of Stress at this point. How can it possibly have so much grit?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: S—Sorry, bana... I'll try again... B—Bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Provoke Brave Monkey
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : Good-for-nothing monkey~ You're no match for me, loser monkey! Go back home and chomp on your bananas instead!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! I don't feel an ounce offended by your failure of a demeaning provocation! You're only coming off as a cutiebananapie!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Speak the ninja mantra with an offensive twist
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : A monkey tryna mimic heroes, ain't that a joke? That fuzzy face of yours makes me wanna choke. Get back to your cell, munch on a snack, you wanna challenge me? You ain't even on track!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: A brilliantly ruthless rendition of the ninja mantra, Baseball Bat Ninja!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! How can you launch into a personal attack on our monkeys! Monkey fans will go into a riot!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Maliciously spew swear words
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : You little *cosmic profanity*! Give up on that *cosmic profanity* act of yours already, or I'm gonna *cosmic profanity* you upside-down!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: O mighty Aeon of The Hunt! Such vile tongue-lashing! Surpassing that of even Evil Ninja's Dispiteous Curse!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! If I hear one more swear word from you, you'll be penalized for breaking the school rules!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: The hero's down and out, defeat hangin' in the air, but in walks the master with wisdom to share—
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Bana, bana bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ..."Bana bana," bana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: You... Tsk, your lines are fine. Go on, next line!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: The master's wisdom resonates to his core, the hero's blade sharper than ever before. Yesterday's loser is back in the fight, fight or flight, evildoers think twice.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Taunt Brave Monkey.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : Aww, look who's back another whooping? You really don't know when to stop, do you? Is that it, rinky-dink dink dink monkey???
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: It's taunting, alright... But you're channeling the wrong archetype! Fail!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Speak the ninja mantra with a provocative twist
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : Your grit's worth a nod, but you're no less of a dud. Better learn how to flow or get lost in the flood. With me spittin' power, a zillion times yours, gonna have to concede or crawl home on all fours!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Stellarly brutal! You've attained the skills of a Semi-Emanator when it comes to reciting the ninja mantra!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail! We're in an acting class! Stop applying whatever you learned in music!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Provoke with swear words
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: : Aren't you that *cosmic profanity* trash I pummeled last time? Back here looking for your *cosmic profanity* again? See how I *cosmic profanity* you!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: This assertive aggression... Silvergun Shura's words, before they were sealed, must have been just as fierce as yours.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Uncouth! Through and through! Fail!!!
[A Clockwork Banana][Brave Monkey]: Bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Ugh. Fail! Fail! Fail! Stop filming, Mr. Reca. None of them are cut out for portraying our beloved monkeys, bana!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Wait! Please, just give me one more—
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Second chances don't come around that often, girl.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Please, I'm begging you! Being in one of Mr. Reca's films is my dream! Um, don't let him know I said that...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: If you want my opinion, there's nothing amiss with Ninja Initiate Gigaku's acting. In fact, you are being overly critical of her.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: You think? Are you the BananAdvisor who grades her work, or the director who assigns her roles? It's up to me to assess my students' worth in this class!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Let's stop filming, Mr. Reca. We need to swap out the actors.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Stop? No, not yet. The show still isn't over—
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana bana, bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: :
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ? Are you alright—ba... bana?
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Bana? Bana, bana! Looks like the banacademics is taking effect.
[A Clockwork Banana][Fellow Students]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Congratulations, students! Thanks to Slumbernana Monkey, you'll soon be qualified actors!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Just as I thought, this is yet another snare laid down by the Evil Ninja.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Hmm? Why are you still lucid? Truly an incorrigible student!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Nay, dinosaur fiendling. Your feeble sorcery stands no chance against my Dazzling Ninjutsu!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Watch me snap everyone back to their senses! Hi-yah! Dazzling Palm: Righteous Chop!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: — A rumble of thunder
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: The overpowering ninja force surged into your forehead once more, snapping you out of your daze. Judging by the recent sounds of impact, every ninja on stage received assistance, even the passing Slumbernana Monkey got a swift chop.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Ow, that hurts!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Oh, I've regained my senses.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Two "chops" in one day!
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Ow... W—What happened?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "The stone heart of a ninja is immune to pressure, immune to lies, come wind, rain, or shine."
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Never forget who you truly are, Ninja Initiate Gigaku.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: A—Are we onto another film now? Is this going to be about ninjas?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: No, but we've come to the climax of the film! Just a small swap among the roles... Charmony BananAdvisor, you're up for the villain this time.
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: What are you even... I said to stop filming! STOP, FILMING!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Cut—! When you're on my set, I AM the director! Come on now, dear actors, let's salvage this lousy film with an electrifying fight scene!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Great ninja minds think alike.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: I agree.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Fighting suits me better.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Yay, I'm no longer the villain!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Yes! My favorite kind of episode!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Bana grr... If you unruly students insist on disrupting my class, you're in for some corrective bananishment! Teach them a lesson, Assistananas!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: From this very moment... Back down, retreat? The hero says "never" — the way of the ninja burning in their heart forever.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: With fiendling blood the sword of justice will be stained, as the school casts off every shackle every chain!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Hey, do I really have to fight too?
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Hopeless students like you are destined to be nothing! Just accept Slumbernana Monkey's grace of a happy life!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: ...Destined? Hmmph, all nonsense! "The ninja's blade can and must sever the chain of cause and effect!"
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: R-Right! "Evil spirit, be reduced to ashes before our ninjutsu!"
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: Fail... I... also failed...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Wicked tongues, wicked lies, all of them destroyed, say goodbye to evil plots, strategies and ploys. The life of the party, savior of the school, let's hear it for the hero, here to keep it cool...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Ninja Initiate Gigaku, deliver your final line.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Bana—scratch that! Evil thing! Your vile words cannot bring Ninja Initiate Gigaku down! It's a victory for us ninjas, hurray!
[A Clockwork Banana][Charmony BananAdvisor]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: This one has ceased operating as well. It's as if some unseen puppeteer cut its strings.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: I went easy this time.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: No pinning the blame on me this time!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Sweet Dreams Troupe gotta up their game.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Ninja Gama, can you kindly enlighten us on the proceedings thus far?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: So, you actors have caught on... Let me reveal the next act in the plot then. We'll be exploring the misdeeds going down at Paperfold University...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Alright now, dear actors. Ever heard of a memetic virus?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Is that what Slumbernana Monkey is?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: You're right. Memetic corruption comes about from the dissemination of data. It alters particles of information picked up by the cognitive module, skewing the sensory perception of certain objects in those that have been corrupted. Much like special effects in a film.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Words, songs, videos... these are all mediums of transmission. Humans naturally have a curiosity for the unknown, and memetic viruses take advantage of this.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Memetic corruption is known to influence one's thoughts even in the real world. And in the Dreamscape, they catalyze nightmares that corrupt humans into monkeys.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Hence, the evil ninja instructs the evil fiendlings to spread through media, masking it as entertainment to implant the seeds of dark sorcery in the hearts of the ninja initiates.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Misappropriating the role of actual educators gave them the perfect chance to mangle the minds of innocent ninja initiates, only to hasten the growth of those fiendish seeds they sowed.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: And so all ninja initiates of Paperfold Town will succumb to fiendishness, becoming puppets of the evil ninja... What a dispiteous, denegerate, and dastardly ploy!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Uh... What are you talking about? Are these lines in the script?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: This actor's lines may be somewhat cryptic, but yes, the general plot direction is on point.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: But Ninja Gama, why are you bogged down by inaction when you've long realized the truth behind their pretense?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I'm just a director that stumbled upon a sinister plan. A reckless move on my part can bring dire consequences! It is up to very important stars like you to defeat that hellkite of a villain.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: These BananAdvisors were appointed by the acting dean, Profnana. I believe I don't have to make this any more explicit. Go to the dean's office to find the answers you seek. Oh, and keep me updated on how the plot unfolds!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Ooh, what about my part? Do I still have any scenes coming up?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: You're keen about appearing in my films, aren't you? Come over here and choose a script.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: C—Can I really? Thank you so much!!!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: A castle showdown looms ahead of us, fellow ninjas. We ought to make haste with ninja speed.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Give it your best shot, fledgling actor. I see great potential in you.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: I—I will live up to your expectations!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": What a surprise, my dear students. Hmm, no appointment or a polite knock on the door... but, I welcome you banantheless.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: Cease the shady evasion! I urge you to come clean now! You're Evil Ninja Osaru's Fiendling Chief, aren't you!?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Excuse me dear student, could you help me translate that?
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: The short story is that a memetic virus has broken loose in Paperfold University. It's going around infecting the students' minds as we speak.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Slumbernana Monkey is that virus, Profnana. And its transmission was orchestrated by none other than your BananAdvisors.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": I had thought this class would last a little longer than this.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Your confession came sooner than we expected. So, is this one of Dr. Primitive's schemes?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": A scheme? Bana tsk, you're thinking too highly of this place! Penacony is nothing but a cesspool of riches. It will never be worthy of the great Doctor's sublime experiments on humans!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Here, it's just me. A second class research ape working in Penacony on my graduation thesis: An atavistic experiment centered around memetic entities.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": My research is going along smoothly. People here adore Slumbernana Monkey, especially students from the youth demographic group. Soon, they'll create a new Synesthesia Dreamscape, "the Moment of Slumbernana," and foster its growth, expansion, and evolution...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: The endless atrocities that Osaru unleashed onto the world... just to build an Evil Realm where a hundred malevolent spirits prowl at night?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Girl, I cannot begin to fathom your cryptic speech. It doesn't sound like you're speaking ill of me... Or are you?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": ...Never mind. Ordinary folks will never understand the great cause of our atavistic experiment. How about a pop quiz before I clarify your doubts? Who knows how bananas reproduce?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Through seeds?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Through pollination?
[A Clockwork Banana][Through Mokuton]: Banana-jutsu!
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: A terrible ninjutsu.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: To maintain their taste, the majority of commercial bananas are produced through "asexual reproduction." Lacking seeds and pollen, they are grown from the same rhizome.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": That's correct. Five Amber Eras ago, the Intelligentsia Guild cultivated a banana species that humans deemed perfect: the golden Slumbernana.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": The golden Slumbernana swiftly dominated the fruit market. Nutritious, sweet, and its peel gives off a mesmerizing golden sheen. It transformed every interstellar banana plantation into a spectacle akin to the Golden Hour at night.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: But it eventually became extinct, didn't it?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Exactly. Because it was cultivated by humans, the Slumbernana lacked room for evolution. Having the same set of genes also meant sharing the same vulnerabilities. And when a fatal cosmic fungus wormed its way into the production line...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": The same banana species that reigned over all the others of its kind was scrubbed clean from the entire cosmos in just mere months.
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Are you saying that humans will suffer the same fate?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Of course. The golden Slumbernana's predecessor was the highly reproductive jadegreen banana. If not for human intervention, it would have blossomed much more vibrantly over the years, much like Penacony as we know it.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": It's a pity those on Penacony just had to be second-rate copycats. What with constructing skyscrapers, building cities, printing currencies, and even making the decision to become like the other cogs in the cosmic marketplace.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Following the exact path of the golden Slumbernana, stubbornly holding onto the status quo, creating fatal vulnerabilities for themselves, and ultimately becoming useless.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Having undergone a flawed Bananenlightenment, the Doctor seeks to return these misguided worlds to their embryonic potential, giving them a fresh chance to develop. This is the atavistic experiment.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: However, I have visited those planets.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: As I traveled from one planet to the other, a prevalent but unpalatable observation struck me: Not a single ninja could speak, they had all become fiendlings...
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: But I know for a fact that they were not born this way.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: The monkey that scurried past you was once a sailor. He knew how to ferment his own wine, and would do so regularly.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: The one in the distance, fighting with other monkeys over a piece of fruit, used to be the smartest person on his planet, even having the knowledge to send people soaring into the sky.
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: But from now on... they're monkeys. Just monkeys.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Am I imagining things? Or did you learn how to speak like a normal person?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Or... could it be that this familiar scene reminded you of your past?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Given the Doctor's brilliant mind, his ambitions are lofty and are sure to be realized. But the commoners? Hmph, all they do is lose themselves in unrealistic fantasies, becoming an impediment to a civilization's evolutionary progress.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Whether imbued with life or not, everything ought to be used to its full potential. Ah, how long has it been now? I'm surprised that lesson hasn't stuck...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Doctor's "failed creation"?
[A Clockwork Banana][Rappa]: ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Dan Heng]: Your scheme ends here.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Is that so? Ever considered why I allowed you to do as you please on campus? Even going as far as to guide you to me?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Paperfold University is nothing more than an incubator, no great loss if discarded. But if it can eradicate the pests in the lab, then it'd be used to its full potential.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Bana bana! That's all I have for you. Class dismissed.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Cut!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Brilliant, absolutely brilliant...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Such a brilliant film... It would be a shame for it to end now.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Alright, cast, get ready to switch scenes!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Just what do you think you're doing, Memokeeper?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I've already met all your demands, dearest producer. Please hold up your end of the deal as we've agreed: Lift this abominable curse that stifles my artistic expression.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Demands? I'm afraid not, Mr. Reca. Until you hand over those incorrigible and willful monkeys, you have not met all of my "demands".
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: But that's not our deal! I went to great lengths to help you infiltrate the school, disrupted The Family's surveillance, and even dealt with the Ranger who was causing you the most trouble. And now you want me to give up ownership of the actors?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: We're talking exceptional talents that are incredibly rare to come by! They have so many more stories waiting to be unearthed! I can't allow their journey to end here.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Mr. Reca, there is no room for negotiation here. I have no need to negotiate with a captive.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": If you don't acquiesce, then in less than three system hours, you'll turn into a Slumbernana Monkey like those students. Hand them over now if your directing career even means anything to you.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: No, I refuse! Profnana, have you ever wondered why I ended up under your control?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Tracking down the Doctor's whereabouts shows you have some skill. However, believing you could follow us unnoticed was quite presumptuous, wasn't it?
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Even if we were to need animals for our experiment, you're nowhere near qualified... "great director."
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: What a pity. I put my life on the line just so I could make this wonderful film a reality. I decided a long time ago that I'd do anything for art, so your threat means nothing to me.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Every film crew knows full well the risks they run the moment filming begins. And in turn, a dedicated director would never stop rolling the cameras, even if it meant having to insert an obelus next to a crew or cast member's name in the credits!
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": In the end, you too are just a pitiable monkey, struggling for worthless dreams.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Profnana": Be prepared to sacrifice yourself then.
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: "Assistant Director": ...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Switching to Boothill's POV...
[A Clockwork Banana][Narration]: Unbeknownst to everyone, the cosmic cowboy who became uncontactable is currently lurking in the shadows of the Dreamscape...

[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][???]: "Hatred is the frailty of the weak."
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Fudgin' banana... That line again!?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Ape 11: And that is everything that Slumbernana Monkey taught me...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Ape 11: Think about this, everyone: the emotions we experience, be it joy, sadness, or an epiphany... every one of them is produced from a subtle shift in chemical composition within this vessel of ours.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Ape 11: With some manipulation, we should be able to easily create or erase emotions. That means triggering a sudden change in your own temperament isn't out of the question!
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Ape 11: So here's my conclusion: Even if a behavior is generated after thorough deliberation, it is no more sophisticated than the simple act of "jumping."
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...What a load of horse manure.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I'm checkin' somewhere else.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Mm-hmm... Huh? Wait!
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Where are you going? It wasn't easy to get in, so don't do anything that'll draw unnecessary attention. At least... stop pointing your gun at people?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Appreciate it, Nameless gal. You have quite the authority 'round here, eh? Has the Astral Express begun to take on monkeys?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: I wasn't expecting that either, but the Assistananas insist I'm a great talent. They even gave me a membership card with a high level of clearance...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: ...Wait, talented for a club that advocates the abandonment of all thought!?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Ain't wrong, am I? You were so darn mesmerized by their speech back there.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Well... I was just listening to what they had to say. It's not like they managed to convinced me anyway. Plus, if they don't talk in rhyme, it's probably just nonsense.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: So, what brought you here? You don't look like you're a fan of these monkeys.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Why not? Galaxy Rangers are forkin' monkey fans. We go bananas at the mere sight of them.
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: So... He's on the hunt for some kind of fugitive? That explains why he's dressed like a sheriff...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Ah, no, no. I guess... you could say he IS a fugitive?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: ...Wh—What?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Yada yada, tell her my life story then. I'm gonna go check the place out.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Aww, there's nothing to be afraid of! He just looks a little scary, but Dan Heng says he's more bark than bite.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Ape 11: And that is everything that Slumbernana Monkey taught me...
[Dead Banana Society][Enthused Slumbernana Association Member]: Ah my friend... you really are bold.
[Dead Banana Society][Enthused Slumbernana Association Member]: How'd you find out I got my hands on an ultra rare BanaCard? Look, it's even embossed in gold!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hey brother, you ain't right in the head.
[Dead Banana Society][Enthused Slumbernana Association Member]: You're right. Ever since I got it, I haven't been able to think of anything else...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Monkey]: Bananana! Bananana!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Not a single thing around here makes sense — this is downright bananas.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hey, Nameless gal. Can we have a little talk over yonder?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Just me? Why can't we just talk here...?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Um, it's okay. You guys go ahead. I'll wait for you over there, March.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Although her tone is normal, there was still a hint of nervousness in Montana's expression as she hurriedly ran off...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: What are you up to? I only just convinced her everything's fine, you know...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Awful chummy with someone you just met, aintcha Friendo?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Alright, great Nameless one, drop the act already. What's the deal on your side? When did you guys start layin' eyes on Dr. Primitive?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Dr. Primitive...?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Ahem. Oh yeah, that's right. Let's swap intel then. You first!
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: It doesn't take much time to tell Dr. Primitive's stories...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Oh, I see... Uh-huh, exactly as we suspected.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: So, did you find anything at Dreamflux Reef?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: There ain't a thing here, but who cares. Seen this plenty of times, and there's only one solution. We've all rid this rodeo, so I reckon I don't need to spell it out.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Uhm, yes. I totally agree.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Sweet. Alright then...
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Boothill & March 7th: Prepare to tear this place apart! / Help me become a high-ranking member.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Uh... I was just trying to make a joke, but you took it even further?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: You're rufflin' my bananas now. That wasn't a joke! If it were the IPC lackeys, I'd have them lined up right this instant for a one-way ticket to other side!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: But they only planted kids in this place. I can't be using my ways on them. It's not the first time Dr. Primitive's used others as scapegoats. I ain't gonna step on the same rake twice.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: But aren't you doing that right now? Falling for the trap.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hah, ever seen a squib load? When timed right, it's more effective than unloadin' a full clip.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I got no clue what kinda monkey business this club's up to, but I know from the static noise at Dreamflux Reef that they're sure as heck interested in Penacony. They'll definitely step in if we raise the roof offa this place.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Unless you've gotta better idea you can think of, then let's do it my way, star member.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Hmm, I do have an idea... sort of. Just hold your horses. Let's go back and meet Montana first. Remember — be nice!
[Dead Banana Society][Unfamiliar Slumbernana Monkey]: Bana, bana, bana—!
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Why did it run off? Aww, I wanted to play with it too!
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: March, you're finally back!
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Yeah! Let's do this again — the right way. This is Boothill. You guys started off on the wrong foot. He's actually a really nice person.
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Oh, don't worry about me. I thought about it earlier. Penacony sees a ton of visitors and transiting travelers. It's only normal to meet people of all sorts of background here.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Yeah, I was wanted on a few occasions too... Ehe, maybe a dozen times? Never mind, that's not important now.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Let's talk about the Slumbernana Association. There's an important seminar scheduled for today, right? Are we in time for that?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Oh, March! You remembered wrong again. This is far grander than a seminar! I guess... you can call it a theophany?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: In just a bit, we'll get to see the actual Slumbernana Monkey in the flesh.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Holy bananas... There are rip-offs of this thing?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Haha, that's not it. Slumbernana Monkey went viral overnight, but people have different opinions on how the fad began.
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: No matter what people choose to believe, there has to be a Slumbernana Monkey that started it all, and we're about to see it! The original Slumbernana Monkey in all its unfiltered glory, free from all sorts of stereotypes.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: I'm not quite following, but it sounds impressive, I guess.
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: We have a few other students from campus who attended a few theophanies before.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: What did they say about it?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Nothing, really. But they had this look... Um, like they'd been to the world's end.
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Every single one of them looked like they were in a state of absolute bliss. I want to feel like that too.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Well, ain't that somethin'. I reckon I gotta see it myself. Still got a bit to wait, huh?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Hey, hold up! Where are you heading off to again?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hey there, pal—
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association Member]: Bana... Bana bana...
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: It's hard to describe what exactly sets him apart in the crowd — he looked over, and the clarity in his eyes was astonishing.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: It seems this person isn't planning to respond.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hey, you can see me, right?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association Member]: Bana... Bana bana...
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: In response to this unprovoked offense, she revealed a smile and then fell silent.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: What's this now, watchin' TV gotta be this complicated?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Oh, you're back.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: This is the theophany that Montana told us about. The only way to see Slumbernana Monkey is apparently through forming some kind of connection with the Assistanana.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Thank you for waiting. Oh, another member hoping to see Slumbernana Monkey?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: No, not her. Just me.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Tsk, trying to worm your way in again, huh? But you won't be able to establish a connection if you know nothing about Slumbernana Monkey~
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: You... look unfamiliar. But you don't seem like a regular member either.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: That's right. Been told I'm quite talented.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Huh? What talent do you have...?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I'm Denisovan 244, March 7th.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Oh, it's you! Yes, I've heard about you. You have the potential to truly reach the source. Please, come over to me.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Not so fast! What are you up to this time?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: The dimmer of us two plays the bait, the other get ready to fight.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Keep watch outside.
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Hey, wait—!
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Hey—! Hellooo! That was fast...?
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Slumbernana Association]: Denisovan 244, March 7th: Really now? So he's actually talented?
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: The sound fades away—
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Unfortunately, the sensory isolation happened too quickly. He didn't have time to hear the girl's question, and reconsiders his adventure.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: "The answer is simple, Miss, this gentleman here..."
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: "He wants to visit the past more than anyone else in the room."
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: What's the big fudgin' idea here, is this all there is?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: We meet again, sir.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hmph. I've seen rundown saloons fancier than this place. You call this a theophany?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Crafting an attractive but deceptive vision is a crude method, entirely opposite to the values that the Slumbernana Monkey aims to share with people.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Many other members before you have come here seeking something. But these tend to be the usual... truth, happiness, peace, and the like.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Unfortunately, there are no answers here, only one question: "Will this make you worse off?"
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: What is this fudgin' nonsense?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Have patience. I will explain everything in detail.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: For example... if I asked you to give up malt juice, what would be your first thought?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: You'll want to get a drink before that, won't you? That should be the exact thought in your head right now.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Just One Stalk of Malt: "Nuh-uh, don't pull that nonsense on me. A classic will always be a classic."
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Wormwood is Fine Too: "Now, hold on there, partner. Sometimes you gotta try somethin' new"
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Introspection is key, no matter the hour.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: You see, these are the thoughts that come to your mind when you were given that question. Sadly, it appears that whichever option you choose, there will be some lingering regret.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: With that, let's go on to imagine a scenario that doesn't hold true in reality...
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Under the gaze of both, the two streams of thought vanishes instantly, leaving no trace behind...
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: If the dependence on the drink was never there to begin with, this problem would naturally not exist, and the resulting thoughts would also disappear.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Here's a question: "Will this make you worse off?"
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: 
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: 
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Moving on, let's turn our attention toward issues that are a little more complicated...
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Say, your hatred for the IPC.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: I see. That is one vast and endless wall of rage you have there.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Since you know, think before you speak, don't go askin' for trouble, ya banana.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Calm yourself. Slumbernana Monkey wouldn't preach about forgiveness or burying the hatchet. Now that's something even I'd find annoying.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Instead, it'd support you taking vengeance into your own hands... Just like this—
[Dead Banana Society][Grunt]: Field Personnel ×1 Senior Staff: Team Leader ×1 Grunt: Security Personnel ×1
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: How do you feel?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: What a load of hogwash, you reckon takin' aim at phony targets is gonna get your blood pumpin'?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: I understand, but venting your anger can help relieve the tension you built up. And when that happens, you'll be less averse to accepting unpalatable advice.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Now, just like before, imagine a scenario that doesn't hold true in reality...
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: For a person who has made revenge their sole purpose in life, what would happen if their hatred were to vanish?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: "Will this make you worse off?"
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Rottin' bananas, what wacky theory are you trying to prove?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Well... what the heck, I actually feel pretty good right now. Yeah... who banana fudgin' cares about revenge!?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Excellent. You're very perceptive. Let's move on to the next lesson then...
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: ...Galaxy Ranger.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: I know very well hatred isn't something that can be easily erased.
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: This will be your toughest lesson, but I'll be with you throughout. Now then...
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: If you end all connections and forget everything that ties you to the world...
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: Will this make you worse off, Mr. Ranger?
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: This is a decisive moment, and the man named Boothill knows it well.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Or rather, the man that was once known as Boothill.
[Dead Banana Society][???]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][???]: I... ain't quite sure what you're talkin' about. But... you sure seem mighty fascinatin'
[Dead Banana Society][???]: Nice to meet ya, partner. What's your name?
[Dead Banana Society][Assistanana 71]: This isn't the first time we've met, but...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: You can call me Profnana Primon.
[Dead Banana Society][???]: Oh, a cultured soul then?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: No, I'm just a research ape.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: And you... you'll soon be mentioned in my research report.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Handling the commotion at the university is easy, the main concern has always been here, Dreamflux Reef. If it weren't for the need to eliminate you as a variable, I wouldn't have purposely slowed down.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: And with that, the class here has come to an end.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Get a move on, dear student. I'll be waiting for you at the end, to unveil... a new chapter of your life.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Erudition is but an affliction that the average person cannot bear...

[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Darkness enveloped everything in silence. Even though no sound could be heard, it was easy to imagine what words were echoing at that moment—
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: "Even if you lose the ability to see everything, you won't be any less happy."
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: No matter how you look at it, the man was always one step behind. The trap he willingly walked into extinguished the very firepower he intended to use.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Thus, after finding his nemesis, his fate was clear — just like those who were once human, he too would transform into a monkey.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Bam—
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Unfortunately, the sense of pain remains — whenever and wherever, it's appropriate to use it to bring someone back to their senses.
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Hey, wake up... Wake up...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Phew, I made it in time! Thank goodness you didn't end up like that!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: W—What happened...?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: No time to explain. Hurry, I need your help!
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: I'll go wake Montana. Hurry!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...Huh?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Wait—!
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: What's going on...?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: This is my grace, Miss Nameless.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: As for your Ranger friend though, you just single-handedly destroyed his path to happiness.
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Stay where you are. Don't come any closer.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Naturally, resorting to violence is not my intention. I'm only here to prove something, not to subjugate.
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Prove... what?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: To prove that my viewpoint...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: ...is in line with the desires of humans.
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Montana?
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: March 7th... What are you trying to do?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Gosh... Montana! Don't you see what's going on? The bad guy's the one behind you!
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: H—How could you say that? And here I thought you loved Slumbernana Monkey from the bottom of your heart...
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: Y—You...
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: ...Bana?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Oh, Montana...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Uh, I think—
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Let's get out of this place now, hurry!
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: As you wish. I look forward to you providing the last link in my proof
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: You're a sicko!
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: This way! Why do you seem so out of it? Haven't you woken up yet?
[Dead Banana Society][Intercepting Slumbernana Association Member]: Bana bana bana...
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: What's your problem! Why are you blocking our way!?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: You're free to leave, if you wish. But not with my subject. He's still under observation.
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Your subject?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Mm-hmm. Unlike typical humans, his modified body is impervious to physical deterioration. With a steely grit and determination that never wavers, he can easily resist all forms of corruption.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Ah, a Galaxy Ranger like him... It'll be worthwhile to see what I can turn him into.
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Let me guess. You want to call for help right away because you're convinced these monkeys, formerly humans who have lost their minds, are under my command.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: If that's the case, why do you believe... that you really woke up the Ranger?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Uh, that can't be right...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Mr. Galaxy Ranger, would you please fire a shot at this young lady?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Hey—!
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: In her hurried turn, she had prepared for the worst. Even if she saw a Slumbernana Monkey aiming a gun at her and pulling the trigger, she wouldn't be too surprised.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: However, Boothill's response was far beyond her expectations—
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: But sir, killin' folks is against the law, especially when it's a lovely lady like her.

[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Accompanied by an unusual tone of voice, what appeared before March 7th was a fantastical scene that could only exist in the realm of memories.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I'm the star of the show now? All 'cause of this here gun?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: It's a nice gun alright. But using it to take a life? I have no such intention.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: How about the two of you settle your own scores, while I'll be on my way?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: You...
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Wait a minute... Is this what you wanted me to see?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: That's. Right. ...This is merely a hollow dream, so even if they turned into monkeys here, their physical bodies in the real world will not be subjected to any biological deterioration.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: The Ranger's extraordinarily staunch and unyielding mind made him an even more valuable specimen to be studied. His mind hasn't been completely wiped out, instead...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: ...he is neither a monkey, nor is he a Galaxy Ranger.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: He's a young Boothill, one from many years back. Back when his homeland hadn't been ravaged, when he lived as a carefree child in the grasslands.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: A partial regression... How very interesting indeed.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: If memory serves, this version of him is at least ten years removed from the older Boothill when he first fired a shot at a bandit.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Miraculous... Be it the Sweet Dreams Troupe or myself, he can end it all with just one shot.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: But it just so happens that the decision to pull the trigger has to be made by his soul rather than his body. The child version of him now is completely incapable of firing his own gun.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Alright, Mr. Cowboy, come to me. Let's finish your final lesson now...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: A Galaxy Ranger that stands on the side of Dr. Primitive, a traitor born from nurture... this warrants several more research papers.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...Dreams?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Hey, don't go over there!
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Be quiet, young lady, and mind your manners while class is in progress.
[Dead Banana Society][Intercepting Slumbernana Association Member]: Bana bana bana...
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: What's your problem! Why are you blocking our way!?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Am I... dreaming?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Yes, of course. This dream is based off your memories... What do you last remember? Were you herding? Or chopping firewood?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Neither of those. I was eating some piping hot stew. That's strange... How did I fall asleep?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: There's a lot of things I should be doing. I guess Nick's gonna kick me awake soon.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Haha, you haven't brought up that name in quite a while. But I suppose that's only right considering where you are on the timeline. For you at this point, everything the IPC does is still in a far-off future.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Hah, what a strange dream. Everything sounds like nonsense.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: It doesn't matter. It's time for you to come back to reality. How does it feel? Does waking up from a dream bring you misery?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Misery? Why, no!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: It's a shame you're stuck in a dream, can't lay eyes on the land I love. It's so gorgeous, you'd be willin' to die right there.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: It's hard to believe someone so young would use that kind of analogy.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Ain't nothin' strange about that, people gotta find ways to soothe their souls, part of that is comin' to terms with life and death.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: There's a saying from Aeragan-Epharshel: "Death is the fairest form of grace".
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: For the good-hearted, death keeps their purity intact. For the cunning scoundrels, death ends things clean and quick.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: I see. Does that mean you're not afraid of death? If so, please extend your hand out for me.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: I suppose you're perfectly willing to apply the "fairest form of grace" to every corner of the universe?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: In the name of Dr. Primitive, that is.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: This is my final lesson for you. You shall thoroughly understand his philosophy.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: And with that, a star will pitifully fizzle out.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: No problem, Teacher. But there's something else I have to tell you...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I was worried about missing my shot... but now that I've gotten ahold of you, I reckon I won't.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: ...What!?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: H—How's this possible...? The regression should've occurred already...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Phew... Wanna know something? I was worried I had it all wrong just now!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: But now, there ain't no problem, 'cause only an evildoer asks "why" before he dies.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I ain't deaf, alright? While you were yappin' so loud, did it ever cross your mind I could tell good from evil?
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: ...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: It's as Nick said: Revenge needs no excuses, just like how there's one thing in the world that doesn't need to be taught...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Taking a shot at bad guys.
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: How did things take such a turn...? You're just a child...
[Dead Banana Society][Controlled Assistanana 71]: Even for someone born with a bad nature, the first time doing something like this should weigh heavily on their conscience...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Is that so? Well, I reckon you got that wrong.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Be it a wanted criminal with the blood of many on their hands or a young cowboy who's never fired a gun, both share a common instinct in every sense of the word...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...And that's to put a bullet in anything evil, muddle-fudger!
[Dead Banana Society][Wave 1]: Banacademic Office's Assistanana ×3
[Dead Banana Society][Wave 2]: Banacademic Office's Assistanana ×4
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I'll let you in on a secret, lil' fudgehead. For tampering with my Synesthesia Beacon.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I'm gonna put a bullet in ya! And if you think this is the faulty Beacon talking, no shirtball, I actually mean it.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Death is the fairest form of grace, especially for muddle-fudgers like you who'll only become worse forms of evil with time.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: That's another good thing about dyin'. Whatever your excuses and ideas are, I ain't gotta waste time listenin' to 'em
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Oh. Uh... Am I late?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: You referrin' to what's finished, or what's only just beginnin'?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: The one that's about to begin? Oh... right! I should go get help. You need to get your head checked, like, right now.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Get my head checked? What in forkin' hell...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: ...Huh?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: My Synesthesia Beacon's back to normal? Dagnabbit, that's forkin' amazing! Hot diggity fudge!
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Huh? So you're saying everything went back to normal once you smashed this thing to pieces?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: I see. No wonder those Assistananas only want to teach students one on one...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I had a hunch, sometimes it's just dead simple, don't gotta be a genius.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Follow me, Nameless. No need for reinforcements, seein' as how a few bullets will clear this up...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Forkin' hell, you think you can find a better shot than me in Penacony?
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: "Profnana": That's right, fellow members. Everything that's about to happen next isn't the end for us.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: "Profnana": With Dreamflux Reef as our starting point, a beautiful world shall descend upon all. And he will eventually cast his gaze upon us and the grand cause that we've forged together.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Grand...? Grand in what way, muddle-fudger?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Alright, folks! Eyes on me! Now listen here: This whole thing is a muddle-fudgin' scheme!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Go, scurry off and hide. Ain't no harm in bein' foolish, but know when to steer clear.
[Dead Banana Society][Montana]: You two again? I can forget everything else you've done, but slandering the name of Slumbernana Monkey before Profnana Primon? Do you even know what you're doing?
[Dead Banana Society][March 7th]: Montana, would you please just hear me out?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Save it. You really think you can still convince them?
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: "Profnana": Mr. Ranger, perhaps going back to our origins—
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Who asked you? I'm only gonna say this once — I ain't interested in hearin' your philosophies or sob stories.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: You're a dastardly evildoer who'll cease to exist once a bullet's put into you. And guess what? I just so happen to be holdin' a gun right now.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Since everything's turned out to be so simple, there's no need to use too much of my intellect. You catch my drift?
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: See, I'm not here to teach a class, shirtbrain...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: I've come to help.
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Class is over.
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: "Profnana": Ah!
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Dun~ dun~ dun~ dun~
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: How's this for extra credit~
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: "Profnana": Bana bana... It's not enough, there's nothing we can do...
[Dead Banana Society][Boothill]: Where you goin'? Sabbatical?
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: Switching to Trailblazer's POV...
[Dead Banana Society][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Previously on Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Destiny elongates time, in the same way ramen noodles are stretched. The Ninja Capital has turned into an abyssal hell under the devastation of Evil Ninja Osaru. Even the mighty Lan would rather close THEIR eyes to the capital's sorry state and let out a long sigh...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: The only remaining ninja, Dazzling Ninja AKA Rappa, has trained an entire decade under the tutelage of Master Kucha to be adept in a wide variety of ninjutsu, gaining also the ability to recite lengthy mantras fluently.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: But deep down Master Kucha is aware that it is only when Rappa receives the tutelage of other Ninja Heroes and embarks upon the paramount way of the ninja as Dazzling Ninja can she save the entire Ninja Capital.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: In the darkest hour of the night, a falling meteor streaks across the sky, marking the graduation of Ninja Initiate Rappa and her new identity as Ninja Hero Rappa...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: The Ninja Capital
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: In the suburban night fog, the streets are colorless, save for the neon signs scattered about, the splendid hues of Dazzling Ninja Seals, and the swift silhouette of the Dazzling Ninja herself.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: What's scattered on the ground like garbage bags are not plastic garbage. Instead, they are the lackeys of the Osaru. The one casting their shadow in front of the Dazzling Ninja is not a dead spirit, but rather an unknown visitor who exudes a powerful and suppressive power...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Greetings. Who might you be?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": My pleasure to make your acquaintance too. We are Ninja Heroes who have received the true teachings of The Hunt. We come forth to punish Evil Ninja Osaru.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Ninja Hero? Huh, it seems that my trial has finally come to an end...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": Trial?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: The final trial of the Mappou Age... Destroy the matrix of Osaru's house and end the catastrophe that has befallen this land.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Pray tell... Have I proven myself worthy of the title of "Ninja Hero"?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": O mighty Aeon of The Hunt! What indomitable ninja spirit she has! Indeed, one as devoted as you rightfully deserves the title of Ninja Hero.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": Greetings, Dazzling Ninja!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Ten arduous years of training finally culminated in this, a new title will be conferred upon me today... I can proudly say that I have never gone against the tenets of Dazzling Ninjutsu all this time. How I wish you were here to witness this glory of mine today, Master Kucha...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": With that, I shall continue my journey to take down the Evil Ninja. Farewell.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Make no haste. Since I am now a Ninja Hero fit to contend with the Evil Ninja... Would you let me join you in your crusade?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": No, for your hunt is long complete. This is mine and mine alo—
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": lo—lo—lo—lo—lo—lo—lone...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: CUT—!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I see... This talent would do well in special effect films.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Ah, we have quite some fascinating actors today. One perpetually films before a green screen, another has been through a change of identities, and...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Assistant Director": ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: And you, of course. The one with the most potential, Festive Superstar from the Land of the Dreams.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Better explain yourself, director.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Your camera's gonna be a victim of my bat~
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Traitorous ninja, engage me in combat!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Please, let me apologize once more. Yes, it is true that I had a working relationship with Profnana, but I was coerced into it. As a memetic lifeform, I inadvertently fell into the hands of my enemies and became infected with a lethal memetic virus.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: You're a Memokeeper?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: You're a Memory Zone Meme?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: No, not those. I have a much bigger role than those extras.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: You're a Slumbernana Monkey?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: No... at least not right now.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I see. The spatial ninjutsu that you displayed earlier was truly ingenious. I wouldn't be surprised if you were a Memo Ninja from the Garden of Zencollection.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dan Heng]: So, am I right to see your act of betrayal at the Dean's Office as a ruse to teleport us to safety here?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Perhaps I was just trying to bail myself out of the situation.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dan Heng]: Bana yourself?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Bana?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Bana bana!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Bana...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dan Heng]: Urk...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: The words you speak...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Well, this seems to be the answer for everything. Banagibberish has long infiltrated every cell and organ of our body.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Since Penacony's dreams are rooted in the desires of the masses, the memetic corruption has had an irreversible impact on the Dreamscape itself. Slumbernana Monkey's sweeping craze wasn't the beginning of things. Rather, it heralded the end...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: From that point onward, the Moment of Slumbernana was fated to be born.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dan Heng]: But what differentiates this from other memetic viruses is the period and extent of its influence, is that right?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I'm impressed. It seems Dan Heng is not only a skilled actor, but also has profound knowledge on communication theory.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Trends come and go, but every single one of them eventually dies down, much like how a violent storm quells with time. We may not be able to dampen the increasing popularity of Slumbernana Monkey, but we can always work to hasten the trend's recession.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: How do we accomplish this, you ask? We'll have to introduce our lead actor for the night!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Yes, it's none other than you, ninja actor.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: The key is in my "past," isn't it?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Profnana Primon once called you... "the Doctor's failed creation."
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I am extremely interested in this. What lies behind your insistence on narrating everything from the intriguing worldview of a ninja?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: When I made the connection between that and the banacademics that we've seen earlier, I came to the realization that this might be the very reason you're immune to Slumbernana Monkey's corruption. What Profnana said also hinted at a possibility that links everything else up.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: That this is but another one of Dr. Primitive's experiments. As for you, actor Rappa, you were already infected with another memetic virus.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "When used correctly, the venom of a scorpion neutralizes snake venom, just as poisoned wine may sometimes be used to quench thirst."
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: What you said is right. I once fell into the clutches of Osaru's domain, when sorcery ninjutsu was inflicted upon me. I had to undergo endless tribulations to break the fiendish spells. Only then did I manage to escape.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: That memory has long become a story I leave behind in my past, though if Pinecany's future hinges on it... I am willing to bring back that memory and face it once more.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Well, well, well. If memetic entities can overwrite one another, so can memetic viruses. If we can just "edit" this virus out of our ninja actor's memory, there may be a way to destroy those nasty monkeys' Synesthesia Dreamscape.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: As the third act of a film, this can well be considered as a masterful development to the overall plot.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: And for the sake of propelling the plot forward, it looks like you'll have to take on a lead role again, Actor .
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Me?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Do you mean Clockwork...?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Watch Baseball Bat Ninja shine like a diamond!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Memetic viruses, no matter the type, can be fatal to a Memokeeper. But that's not the case for you. As the protagonist, you will surely be able to unveil the truth behind the numerous layers of foreshadowing in this film.

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Go on, take my film reel and turn her memories into the "MacGuffin" that will shatter this plot once and for all.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: :
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dan Heng]: Given how that director does things, we probably can't leave this place if the memetic virus from Rappa's memories isn't extracted via editing. Let's proceed with caution.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Actor ... No, I should be calling you interim director instead. Please go to the "set" where ninja actor is to begin filming.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: As for any final advice I can give you — Do not go overboard on the number of shots, be skilled in your editing, and don't cross the axis when filming a dialogue.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: You faintly hear the playful Banagibberish of monkeys outside the door, and the happy, cheerful, carefree tones make you feel a twinge of *banana* envy.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dan Heng]: , where are you going, bana?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Yeah, you came here to enjoy campus life, so why are you getting caught up in this mess? What do these *banana* troubles have to do with you anyway?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Your journey always seems like this]: forced to take risks, forced to strive, forced to solve problems, with no freedom at all. Can't you ever truly choose to "give the *banana* up"?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hey. You have more memetic viruses on you than the number of trashy Penaconian films released this month. If you wander outside and provoke those monkeys again, you're really going to be done for!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Don't listen to him. Make a truly free choice and embrace the *banana* freedom of a monkey's life!

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Alas...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Ninja  was unable to resist the allure of fiendlings' evil.  trailblazing way of the ninja has now been severed!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: But upon entering the realm of fiendlings,  felt no more worries or suffering and spent  time with the ape-friends. When every day is drowned in joy, the rest of one's life will also become free and unfettered.

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Hold on a second.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Ninjas only strike when the opportunity presents itself. Waiting might be the right course of action to take for now.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Pray tell, what does it mean to be a Ninja Hero? And how does one become a Ninja Hero?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Through talent? Lineage? Inheritance? Or being possessed by the ninja spirit?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Nay, none of these!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Across the wide expanse of the Cosmic Ninja Realm, those who practice ninjutsu are as prevalent as flying fish roe, yet Ninja Heroes are as rare as precious golden pufferfish.

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Experiment Records from Department 1Direction]: Cultivation of psychic subspeciesProgress: 100%Status:Successful.Thirty subjects' ability to detect psychic waves vanished when their brain volume was reduced to approximately 340g. The experiment transplanted the tentacles of modern Dyvaron \"Banaducation Specimen\" onto simianized psychic subspecies, thus advancing their capacity to harness psychic waves by three evolutionary levels.Future experiments will involve subjecting the specimens to extreme high-temperature environments and using growth-accelerating drugs and artificial reproduction for accelerated evolution. We anticipate the complete results will be deployed in Combat Apes armies and used to pluck "Banaducation Specimen" from volcanic planets in the future.

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Direction]: R&D on the recipe for the super-rapid evolution drugsProgress: 99%Status:In Progress.The drug worked as expected. Chimpanzees that consumed the drug grew into a form similar to Homo sapiens within three hours, gained the intelligence equivalent to that of a 14-year-old Homo sapiens, and can make primates of lesser intellect conduct rather complicated operations through Synesthesia Beacons and electric shock collars. In experiments conducted on adult Homo sapiens, individuals Homo sapiens displayed varying evolutionary responses. Most individuals experienced significant increases in physical fitness, muscle density, and intelligence levels within a short period. A few individuals exhibited serious atavistic reactions on their bodies instead, with the cause remaining unknown. The death probability from continuous dosing exceeding 50g stands at 100%, making it impossible to explore the potential for surpassing the known evolutionary limits from extant species. Currently, we need around 100 "Banaducation Specimen" from long-life species for the final test. We have commissioned the Collection Forest to send a Combat Ape squad to pluck such materials.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Experiment Records from Department 3Direction]: Testing the upper limit of intelligence for the Pan-Placentalia cladeProgress: 100%Status:Failed.The experiment aimed to atavistically regress healthy Homo sapiens "Banaducation Specimen" into creatures from the Pan-Placentalia clade through cognition anchors, while retaining their memory and intelligence levels. Out of 50 experiments conducted, 32 cases resulted in immediate fatalities, 11 cases failed to retain their memory and intelligence, and 7 cases managed to preserve only a small amount of memory. Without explicit instructions from Dr. Primitive, it is prohibited to pursue experimental directions beyond the primate suborder.

[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: This scroll describes the sorcery and crimes attributed to Evil Ninja Osaru. Such ruthless and immoral sins... All who read it will undoubtedly tremble before this monstrosity!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Strange Robot]: Bana, bana. Atavistic target: Old World monkey. Gene regression progress: 7%. Vital signs: Stable.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: This is Evil Ninja Osaru's ninja scout. It is currently monitoring the victims imprisoned in their cages... O mighty Aeon of The Hunt, evildoers have cast their covetous eyes upon the world. How can you continue to slumber with your eyes closed?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa?]: Salutations, Master Kucha. I have... deciphered the enchantment.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Wh—What...? It's not even two system hours...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa?]: Master Kucha, do I... count as a "ninja initiate" now?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": ...Ahem. Why, yes!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": O child new to the way of the ninja, I recognize your determination. Henceforth, you shall be the successor to my Dazzling Ninjutsu.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa?]: Thank you, Master. This is... my greatest honor.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Behold the city of shadow! A sinful land of suffering, hatred, and sorrow. Bloody tears soon to devour all hope for the morrow.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Soulless Evil Ninja Osaru, agent of the vile, cast the masses into sin by foul arts and guile. Fiendlings indulgent in evil gone wild, enraged the hearts of all — man, woman, and child.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Inherit the legacy of the Ninja Hero and wipe clean the sins of Osaru. End the suffering wrought upon the Ninja Capital and bring peace back to its people.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa?]: I will continue to train hard... till the day I become the Dazzling Ninja that Master speaks of.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": An admirable resolution! To contend with the Evil Ninja, you will also need a new name — a name befitting a ninja.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa?]: Name...? Is AK-A-3 a name?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I don't know, my disciple. Your name will carry your ideals, your convictions, and your destiny. Your ninja name belongs to you alone.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": So, the decision is yours to make.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa?]: ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: In that case... I choose Rappa. To have a dedicated heart that will never be disturbed, and to pacify all evil and demonstrate justice... that was Master's initial teachings to me. I wish to use them in my name.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": As you wish! Nice to meet you, Dazzling Initiate AKA Rappa! You will now embark on an arduous training to become a ninja. Can you keep up?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Certainly. Pain is but common to a ninja and I shall never flinch in the face of it.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: A fiendling... No, it is a Dazzling Fiendling under Master Kucha, though not directly. This fiendling harbors just as much hatred for Evil Ninja Osaru.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Dazzling Fiendling]: No. 3... take medicine...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Secret concoctions of concealed evil. It contains an excessive amount of ninja strength. Swallowing it means enduring bone-shattering pain.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: However, to become a Ninja Hero, I must consume these pills every day... Only then can I create a never-ending source of Cosmic Ninja Strength within my body. Yes, this is a trial to temper my mind and body.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Swallow the Ninja Pill.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Swallow it, for the sake of the Ninja Capital...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Refuse to swallow it.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Steel your nerves... A Ninja Hero never fears!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: The moment you take the medicine, intense pain overwhelms your senses.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Your skin, muscles, bones... You feel every part of your body being eroded, destroyed, and reconstructed...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: :
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Osu! Having persevered through unending nights of tribulations, I will boast... the impenetrable body of a Ninja Hero.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: This is Umbra Headmistress, the head of the dojo and a reliable supportive figure for us Dazzling students.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: She uses the Great Narukami Circle to awaken the latent potential of ninjas. After attaining enlightenment via reverse lightning ninjutsu, one's body can then possess extraordinary ninja senses.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": No. 3, I am about to increase the intensity. You better be able to handle it. The future of this laboratory is all in your hands.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Yes, that is the plan... The future of the Ninja Capital shall be shaped by the Dazzling Ninja Hero. I will definitely fulfill my promise.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Accept the Great Narukami Circle.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Put it on, for the sake of becoming a Ninja Hero...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Flee.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Rid all thoughts of escape... Ninja Heroes never flee!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: The collar emits powerful electrical currents, like thousands of needles piercing through your flesh and blood, and countless bombs exploding within your body. Your heart begins to beat at an unusual rate. You hear countless noises, including the deaths of protons.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: :
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Osu! Having persevered through unending nights of tribulations, I now boast... the vast senses of a Ninja Hero.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: These fiendlings are Rebel Apes of Osaru's clan. They would spar with me every day, improving my ninja skills and refining my ninja martial prowess.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rebel Apes]: No. 3. Stress Response Training Tier IV. Fighting low-level combat apes...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I have never won against these fiendlings, for I am still but a mere ninja initiate.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Yet, if I am to become the Dazzling Ninja, I must vanquish these fiendlings! Only then can I be worthy of defeating Evil Ninja Osaru... To battle! Do not stop until the crows start cawing at the crack of dawn.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Spar with them.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Let the hunt begin, for the sake of defeating evil one day...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Must endure
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Refuse to fight.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Turn back around... Ninja Heroes never retreat!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Can't retreat
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: The fiendlings have approached you. Even though it's just practice, you have to take on them with a true hunting attitude!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rebel Apes]: No. 3. Cleared experiment Tier IV... Rating increased...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "The way of the ninja is long and windy, and trials and tribulations are mere amusements..."
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Osu! Having persevered through unending nights of tribulations, I now boast... the unrivaled stature of a Ninja Hero.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Master Kucha... and Umbra Headmistress?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Use a memetic virus on No. 3... How would that help the experiment?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I can clearly hear everything they're saying... Is my superhearing capable of picking up even whispers among ninjas now? A joyous discovery indeed.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Denisovan 22, we need to increase No. 3's mental resilience.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Enough with these lame excuses. You just can't bear to see her suffer, can you?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": She might not be able to withstand the later experiments. If we use the memetic virus to perform cognitive intervention and ensure that her mind remains stable, the experiments can proceed more smoothly.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Fine, but make sure not to bring your personal feelings into this. The Research Apes aren't exactly happy about how you are allowing No. 3 to run around at will.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": She's able to decipher the password to the modification cabin in just two system hours. There's no way we'll be able to cage her up like any old gorilla...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Do not be troubled over me, Master. Mere physical suffering can never devastate my ninja spirit.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Following Master Kucha's instructions, Rappa ventures into the magical vessal made of ninja tech...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Information dilution at 74%. Consciousness anchor locked on. Memetic etching is about to begin.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Ninja Initiate Rappa, are you ready? The illusory sorcery that the Evil Ninja cast upon you is about to be broken!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Memetic etching is about to begin. Let's get out of here! Or we'll get affected as well.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I... I see it now! To think, there's such a majestic capital in the Ninja World!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Awesome! Looks like it was a success...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Since we're on this, why ninjas?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Oh, because of the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": The what now?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": "In order to protect the helpless weak and save the fallen Ninja Capital, the righteous Ninja Hero hunts down the world's Evil Ninjas!"
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": ...It's a manga series. After we sealed off the research institute to hide from the Galaxy Rangers, my manga collection has been her only source of entertainment.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Now I know why No. 3 always looks so loopy...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": You'd better be careful not to go overboard with giving her such useless information. There's only one horizontal axis on Erudition's coordinate system. Everything else is an impediment to progress.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": That's especially true for the banal concepts of good and evil... Haven't the Galaxy Rangers given us enough trouble already?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": You'll never get the Doctor to notice you if you keep being so narrow-minded.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Is that so? Would Doctor... really notice ordinary mortals like us?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Part Two]: Vanquisher in Dazzle
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You're transferring No. 3 to Denisovan 22? Why!?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Research Ape]: Simple. You won't be able to graduate. According to Denisovan 22's reports, you have been guiding the experiment in the wrong direction.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": No! Let me ask her what she means by this!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": It's an honor for me to represent Laboratory 17 and elaborate on our beliefs to all who are present today...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Wise attendees, as you can clearly see, our universe today is nothing but a crate of abandoned bananas.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": In order to save the worlds marching towards rot and decay, humanity must regress! Regress! And regress further! Only then will civilization be imbued with endless possibilities yet again, allowing Erudition to shine with kaleidoscopic rays once more!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Do not be concerned by the accusations and criticisms of others, for a grand cause must always use the dreams of the common masses as kindling. Yet, it is blissful for them to become kindling, for rotten wood only contributes the greatest value when it is set ablaze.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": People should make use of their talents to the fullest, just as items should be utilized fully! We must ensure that every "monkey" in the experiment fully comprehends this bliss. Let us burn alongside them in happiness!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Researchers]: Burn! Burn! Burn!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Denisovan 22! What is all this!?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": I've graduated. Now you need to call me Ape 22.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": As for what this is? That specimen is the new human that our laboratory painstakingly bred with genes filtered from the atavistic experiments, but you made her a lunatic. The Research Apes have decided that I will take over her nurturing from here on out.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Who's in charge isn't important, but you can't continue the experiment anymore. She'll break.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": That's fine. I'm already nurturing No. 4. If something happens to 3, we'll replace her with that new one.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": How could you!? We brought her up since she was a baby! Do you not have a shred of morality!?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Morality? Are you really talking to me about morality?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": On Bacchus-II, morality is how every family's second son must be sacrificed to Nanook. On the Interstellar Principality of Pegasus, morality is how bipedal organisms must be enslaved by quadrupedal ones. On the Kapakala planet, morality is how blue-eyed individuals are forbidden from walking on the streets.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Morality has bound the wisdom of those people and ended the future of those worlds. That was why Dr. Primitive chose them as targets of the atavistic experiment.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": The sacrifices we made are not for such vulgar things. Rather, they're meant to create a future where humans can be happy, where the universe can continue to advance, and one that the Doctor can be proud of!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Umbra Headmistress, you're... destroying the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions? Why?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Cognition isolation is the first step to curing one of a memetic virus. You were supposed to have the intelligence of a genius, but such garbage ruined it.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": ...Rip them. Tear them to shreds yourself.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Why...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: This... This is the dearest treasure of the Dazzling Ninja school. We cannot do that...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Odd. I've always thought of you as obedient. You always did everything Denisovan 75 said. Why aren't you obeying me?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: —Bam!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Ouch...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Agh... Your muscle fibers sure are densely packed. It's like slapping a rock.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: The palm... Why... used on me...?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: I'm wrong
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Hurry and tear up this trash!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": As long as you perform well, both Denisovan 75 and I will be praised. You don't wish to disappoint him, do you?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Can't let him down
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Master Kucha...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I understand. This must be Master Kucha's trial for me. He's testing my ninja skills of letting go...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Umbra Headmistress and Master Kucha? What are they talking about...?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Denisovan 22! You cannot get rid of her!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": No. 3 is also a failed experimental subject. She barged into the storage room without permission, created a huge mess, and was rude to the Research Apes. Just that alone is enough to make her a failure.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": But you know that was just an accident.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": I'm a Research Ape, not a BananAdvisor. You're the one who made her into this damned state she is in. The laboratory should hold you accountable for the way she turned out.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Damn it...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Master Kucha, have I... done something wrong?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": ...No, Rappa.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You have done extremely well. A true Ninja Hero must wholeheartedly devote oneself to the way of the ninja.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You foiled the Evil Ninja's schemes and saved so many innocent people... You undoubtedly already have the bearing of a true ninja.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Am I really a true ninja now?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Of course... Now, Ninja Initiate Rappa.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Yes, Master.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You've trained under me for five years. After rigorous tests and trials, you've mastered hundreds of ninja techniques.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I hereby bestow upon you the title of Dazzling Ninja, entrusting you to be my weapon to defeat the evil ninja and guide the Ninja Capital into the future.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Thank you, Master Kucha. This is my greatest honor...!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Take the scroll with you, for within its pages lie the secrets of Dazzling Ninjutsu. It shall cast a brilliance that makes fiendlings fear and destroy the evil ninja's intricate matrices.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Paint it throughout the Ninja Capital. Banish the shadows with ink, and raise the banner against evil.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: What should I paint?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I do not know, my disciple.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You may paint anything that you wish. This is your own ninjutsu.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": So, the decision is yours to make.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: ...Yes.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: This is where the matrix core is. According to Master, Dazzling Ninjutsu can overwrite the Evil Ninja's matrix.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Channel the mantra into the colorful brilliance, then paint it over the existing mantra on the matrix core... What wondrous ninja tech.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Dazzling Ninja Seal, open!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Success! This way, the Evil Ninja's matrix can finally be broken.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Denisovan 75, what is going on!? There's digital graffiti all over the laboratory. It even crashed the security system!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": I have no idea... Someone must've hacked in. I'll check on it right away.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Well be quick about it! If we don't fix it soon, the Rangers are gonna find us!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Master Kucha, I have placed the Dazzling Ninja Seal all over the Ninja Capital.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Good work, Dazzling Ninja. This way, the Evil Ninja's matrix will no longer be able to stop our communication ninjutsu.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Make haste, Rangers. Bring this ridiculous farce to an end...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": ...Stop!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": What are you doing, Denisovan 75!?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Denisovan 22...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": H—How dare you deceive the experimental subject, your fellow research partners, and the Research Apes!? The biggest mistake Laboratory 17 ever made was to allow a research fraud such as you to infiltrate this place!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: What is... Umbra Headmistress talking about?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Rappa, she is a follower of the Evil Ninja.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: What? Umbra Headmistress... is a traitorous ninja?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Enough! Combat Apes, take care of them!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Dazzling Ninja, there has been a change to your trial today. I now ask you to... vanquish those traitors!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Understood! I shall demonstrate for Master the Dazzling Ninjutsu I just learned!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": How could this happen? These Combat Apes were personally trained by the Research Apes...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: My long hours of training have finally paid off. This is Dazzling Palm.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Look. This is what they call the "failed subject."
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": We conducted this experiment together. We were the ones who shaped her into this: someone with unparalleled intelligence, extraordinary perception, and incredible power...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Tell me. In what sense of the word is she considered a failure?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Y—You... how dare you question the Doctor's theory? The Research Apes must have their own considerations!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": The security system will be repaired soon. Prepare to feel the full force of Dr. Primitive's wrath, you oblivious kindling!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": You're wrong.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Dr. Primitive... wouldn't care about ordinary people like us.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Rappa, this trial is over. You should go.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: But, Master Kucha...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Leave, Rappa.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: ...Yes.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": Y—You are secretly concealing weapons as well? What are you planning—
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": Denisovan 22... thanks to you, I finally understood that morality is indeed a hypocritical and superficial concept...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": That's why I've decided to ditch it for good.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Umbra Headmistress": W—Wait, my friend! Please... Please, put the gun down. We've been classmates for so many years now. You can't—
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": "Umbra Headmistress," it's time you breathed your last.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: ...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Master Kucha": This... is karma.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Police Report]: Warning: Unauthorized personnel detected in Corridor C11. Security Apes to activate security measures at once.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: The Evil Ninja is about to set a matrix here. Using the ninja tech left to me by Master, I shall pave the way for those Ninja Heroes that are soon to arrive!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Police Report]: Warning: Corridor C11's security system appears to have malfunctioned. Technical Apes to troubleshoot at once.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Police Report]: Warning: Corridor C11's security system has largely gone out of control.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Police Report]: Warning: Corridor C11's security system is no longer functional. Corridor C11...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][???]: Hey, little miss, are you alright?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Pleasure to meet you. Who... might you be?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": Galaxy Ranger. I received a distress signal. This place really is the territory of Dr. Primitive's henchmen. It's as hard to find as those *Ninja Slang* bananas hidden in the woods.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Ninja Hero? Huh. It seems my trial has finally come to an end.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": Trial? What kind of *Ninja Slang*... Another poor kid driven mad by those monkeys, *Ninja Slang*.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: The final trial of the Mappou Age... Destroy the matrix of Osaru's house and end the catastrophe.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Pray tell... Have I proven myself worthy of the title of "Ninja Hero"?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": *Ninja Slang*, no way... So that's why all those *Ninja Slang* in the lab are lying dead on the ground.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": Was it all your doing?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Ten years of suffering, one day of recognition...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I have not let down Dazzling Ninjutsu... Master Kucha, I really wish you could witness this...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": *Ninja Slang*, I get it now. This girl's infected with a memetic virus. *Ninja Slang*, most people would've turned into complete *Ninja Slang* by now, but she's still running around like nothing's wrong?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": Please, listen to me! You're in serious danger right now. If you don't get treated soon, your brain will eventually burst!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Wait! Since I am now a ninja hero who can contend with evil ninjas...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Might I... lend you a hand?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": *Ninja Slang*, you're asking me this now. Do you have a death wish?
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: "Ninja Hero": You want to go on The Hunt? Know that this is a road of no return!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Great Lan above. Eradicating evil, till my last breath. My bow drawn, no turning back...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: ...My heart shall remain unmoved.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: Whoever follows the way of the ninja is a ninja. I...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Rappa]: I've made my decision.
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions]: Past ReverieThe End
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: And, CUT—! Fabulous, absolutely fabulous! Actor , you'll surely become a director as great as me in the future!
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: These memories are enough to create a sensational hit that will destroy ambiguity and bring a close to this absurd monkey show. But before that...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Mr. Reca: The prelude prepared for the climax is all ready elsewhere...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Switching to Boothill's POV...
[The Men Who Tread on the Monkey's Tail][Narration]: Unbeknownst to everyone, the cosmic cowboy who became uncontactable is currently lurking in the shadows of the Dreamscape...

[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: The camera shifts to a new scene, unveiling the story of another group of actors...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Don't worry. Everything's fine now.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Oh wow, that's muddle-fudgin' fantastic news! As if I haven't already told you that the last few times...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: There's no need for my head to be checked... let alone a consultation!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: I mean, we needed an excuse for your behavior anyway... Surely insanity counts?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: What are you even saying!?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: All hope is not lost yet. It looks like Dreamflux Reef is the enemy's real target.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Everything that the both of you saw and heard at the Slumbernana Association is evidence enough. Thankfully, you managed to intervene in time and put a stop to their schemes for now...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Even so, the current situation is still rather grim.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Apologies, but I only bring bad news...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: And good news too?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: I wish... But no, nothing of the sort.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Oh well, at least you didn't say "worse news"...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: The "conversion" is still in progress. The number of monkeys in Dreamflux Reef is still increasing, and I'm certain they used to be residents of the place.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I sense the same. There is still a discordant static on Dreamflux Reef.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Call it bewitchment or persuasion, the fact remains that such dissonance has indeed wrenched open the emptiness in people's hearts.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I went to a few trustworthy Bloodhounds for help, asking them to eliminate any Assistananas that they come across. Looks like that's not helping the current situation...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Mr. Micah, you know Dreamflux Reef the best among us. Do you have any suggestions?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: We're in a race against time, so I'll dispense with the formalities.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: In Dreamflux Reef, there are still Assistananas working in secret, searching all over the place for residents who haven't been turned into monkeys and pushing them into that abyss. If the both of you are willing to aid us, it'll buy us more time.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: As for Miss Robin... you may just be the key to resolving this crisis.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: But if we were to ask for your help, we have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario where the boundary between Dreamflux Reef and The Family will no longer exist. I... will need your promise regarding the future of this place.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I understand... In that case, please go ahead with your plans first, Mr. Boothill and Miss March 7th.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Before you wrap up your business, we will have made our decision too.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: I'm only hesitating so much because this is going against Dreamflux Reef's principles.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Montana! W—Wait up... Watch out!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Montana]: March...?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Good thing you haven't been converted!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: See? Those things are not—
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Montana runs off on her own before March 7th even finishes speaking...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Hey, I'm not done yet!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: We can't leave her alone! I'll meet up with you later. This isn't me running away from a fight, okay?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Pfft. I wouldn't have thought that until you said it.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Being able to see an actor who isn't a monkey... fills me with such joy.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: This scene would be overly monotonous otherwise.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Though I too find this way of making my entrance rather excessively deliberate, we're not blessed with the luxury of time...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: What's a little blatant engineering in the opening sequence, won't you agree?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Who are you? Robin's people? No... You're a Memokeeper.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Keen intuition, but that layer of my identity isn't important. I am only here because of my fastidiousness toward the theatrical arts.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: What in forkin' hell are you trying to say?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: I was planning to tell you to stay away from this place, but you're being so annoyingly pretentious that you're better off turning into a monkey. At least you'd be less noisy then.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: You may think that I popped up out nowhere — and yes, you can attribute that to a lack of foreshadowing. I wouldn't have approved such a sloppy sequence in usual cases.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Yet, for the sake of this film, I am willing to forgo some of my standards to offer some tiny clues to you and the other Ranger.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Oh, Rappa sent you? No wonder you're talking in that same convoluted manner.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: At present, there is an obvious way to save Dreamflux Reef. As long as The Family steps into the picture, resolving the mutation that's occurred here would be a piece of cake. However, this is not a solution that the masses may be willing to accept.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: You think too little of the people here.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: They gave up on those sweet dreams out there just so they can be true to themselves. You reckon such people would grovel at the feet of The Family over a mere crisis?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Yes, Mr. Micah thinks the same. But that perseverance of theirs isn't going to save Dreamflux Reef. I don't wish for this film to develop into a tragedy either.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: If the residents of Dreamflux Reef hope to tide over the crisis without The Family's help, they will have to sing their very own song of Harmony. This is why I'm here.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I have prepared a big gift for all of you — The "outline" for the next act. You'll see once you open it.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: And why should I believe you?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I am the director of this film as much as I am an actor in it. When it comes to the last scene that I will appear in...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: There's no reason for me not to seek perfection.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Truth be told, I do not find the way I entered the act to be satisfactory, but I believe your acting will make this scene better.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Ha, I knew it. There's no way the lil' fudgehead will come right out and say what he actually means.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Let's see just what you're up to then.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Before opening it, he has many speculations—
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: He also believes that no matter what he sees, he can maintain his usual contempt and mock the other for his trickery.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: But right after doing that...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: This is...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: ...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Ha... Hahahahahahahahahaha...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Darn right, he is! That muddle-fudger does know what he's talking about. Nothing else can beat this if the people of Dreamflux Reef have to come together to sing their song of Harmony!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Time to go back to that singing queen! Forkin' hell, this place totally ain't shabby enough to ask The Family for help!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: ...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I understand. I'll try my best, Mr. Micah.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Alright there, hold your horses! What do y'all have so far?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Oh, it's you Mr. Boothill... How are things outside?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Same ol' sorry sight. Not that I miss it.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Have we really come to this...?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: What's do you mean, pardner? Am I going to have to start learning how to greet The Family now?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: ...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: On the contrary, that's something that will never happen in Dreamflux Reef.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: At the end of the day, I'm just Dreamflux Reef's Night Watch... not its leader. I'm loath to interfere with people's right to choose.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Choose? Don't tell me you believe they chose to become monkeys?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: That's exactly my point. These are people who seek their true selves. I don't believe they would seek happiness by erasing their individuality.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: But I won't stop them from heading towards destruction... as long as they made the decision with a clear head.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Hah, that's my boy!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: If there are people who aspire to become monkeys, I won't deny them of that dream.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: But I hope Miss Robin would at least give them that right to choose once again.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: There is indeed a way to resolve the impending crisis without drawing The Family's eyes to Dreamflux Reef.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: We know the tuning of Harmony can erase the static noise. If the people of Dreamflux Reef are willing to follow my lead in singing a Charmonic tune together, we may be able to erase the heinous noises reverberating around Dreamflux Reef.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: But knowing how a number of residents here view The Family... It won't be easy for the plan to work.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: More importantly, if The Family's tunes become the only song left on Dreamflux Reef... We would've survived the crisis, but Penacony's only land of freedom would also cease to exist.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Bah, just have every sound and voice come together in a single song! Listen. I have a fudgin' brilliant idea!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Come with me, singing queen! Whether it works or not depends on how much of a deviant you are.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: The two arrive before the open-air stage in Dreamflux Reef...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: You ready for it? Now this is the only way to get everyone in Dreamflux Reef to sing together...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: This...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Need I say any more?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Don't tell me that you've been so used to your classy posh instruments that this thing is beneath you.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: No, that's not it... I know a thing or two regarding everything related to tunes.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: But... this really is absurd.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: ...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Perhaps an absurd crisis calls for an equally absurd solution.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: That's the way. Leave the rest to me. I'll make sure to get everyone we need.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Some people saved their world by giving a dance, and some people defeated their enemies by crying... It's finally our turn now!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Got a crisis? Throw a party, yee-haw!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Perhaps an absurd crisis calls for an equally absurd solution.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Howdy, partner! What's wrong, pals? Ooh, that's one distressed look you have there! Haven't been swiggin' enough, eh?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Anxious Citizen]: Shut up, cowboy. Enough snide remarks. Come over and help us out.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Oh? That's exactly what I'm here for! Here, head over to this place and just wait for it.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Hah, I called it, didn't I? Who needs all that brain when swingin' around on the dance floor solves things just the same?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Monella]: A cowboy? Oh, right... the same guy as the other time! Could Miss Robin be...?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Monella]: Come with me, everyone! I think he might just be making some sense!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Anxious Citizen]: Monella, why are you...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Anxious Citizen]: Never mind. What's one more loony to the count? Let's go see what's going on then.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Monella]: It's Miss Robin, in the flesh! I knew it...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Anxious Citizen]: What do you know? Now's not the time to be a fan. How's this place even going to be a shelter?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Patience, pal. Wait till the crowd starts spilling in. That's when it'll happen.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: ...That's right. I'm not trying to persuade anyone, or offering a suggestion while standing on high ground.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: I'm simply offering an option that has never crossed your minds. It's your choice if you want to give up on saving yourselves.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: He's getting the hang of it. Guess I'll just stay out of it then.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Snap out of it, cowpokes! There's a big party going on over there, and it's lit as fudge. Why don't you go check it out?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Callous Citizen]: Micah already told us about it. Chiming in on The Family's harmonic tunes? You best get the hell out of my face!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Sheesh, isn't that one of my lines? But sure, if you prefer it this way...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: I know I'm being a lil' demanding here, but get your hide parts over to that party right now and save your home, or I'll make sure to dedicate an elegy for every one of you!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Callous Citizen]: You...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Never seen a thug before? I'm not Micah. Wanna try me and my gun?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Callous Citizen]: What's going on...? Are fellow humans more dangerous than those monkeys now?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Callous Citizen]: Fine, we'll go to the party. Just... keep that gun of yours away.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Oh ho, you sure turned obedient here. So, how do you like this party, pal?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Callous Citizen]: What? Are you here to watch over my shoulder now?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Pfft. That singing queen's gonna put up a once-in-a-lifetime performance. You bet I'm not missin' it.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: I'll do anything to catch the opening. Make sure you don't miss it too!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: My, my, my, look who's here!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Montana]: ...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Ahh... I've been looking for you all day!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Hmm, should I believe that or not...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Oh, alright then! I'll just take half the credit for those Assistananas we took out earlier.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Yeah, that's also just "half" of the whole lot.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Huh? So that's why nothing's going back to normal! C'mon, we need to hurry.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: No need for that. We've got a new plan now. How did it go with her? Convinced?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Montana]: ...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Montana]: I—I'll help out wherever possible.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Jeepers! How'd you get through to her? Mashed her Assistanana to pulp?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Montana]: March explained everything to me. I wasn't really influenced by the Assistananas... It was something else.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Anyway, it's not your fault. Those bananas are incorrigible! Preaching about how having nothing is best... More like they wouldn't be able to control a single human if none of us thought that way.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Say whatever they like. They're nothing but smashed fudges once I put my bullets into them.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Everything ironed out between you two now? Follow me then.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: Wow... Everyone's here!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Hah! What was it you said? Who in their right mind would sing in a choir in this era?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Not when you tell them there's a party. That's when people come flockin'.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: What? A party?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: You're back, Mr. Boothill.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: We wouldn't have this turnout if it wasn't for Mr. Micah.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Most of them are unwilling to trust me, much less the power of Charmony. But... they chose to put their faith in Mr. Micah.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: I think it's less about believing me than them not wanting to give up on this place.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Everyone's got something they want to prove. It's the first time Dreamflux Reef has ever had a way to overcome difficulties on our own, without relying on The Family.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][March 7th]: So, what exactly are you gonna do?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: You're likely to find it... a little unbelievable. I still can't wrap my head around how I actually agreed to this. I must be crazy.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: What's so scary about that!? I have to do something crazy every once in a while. THAT keeps me from really going nuts.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Alright, let's get the party going! Once the hype is at its peak, I'm gonna treat everyone to a drink! Heh, I'm starting to like you guys now.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Thank you in advance, Mr. Boothill, but I'd like to remind you on behalf of Jessie that your seven cups from before haven't been paid yet.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: But I'm willing to take care of that bill, of course.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I've hosted several acting gigs in the past, but this is the most unusual of the lot. Will it really work?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Don't overthink it, singing queen. Let me tell you something funny. I'm sure you can tell I've been through some modifications on my body. When I just started out as a cyborg, my memory module fizzled out every so often. And I didn't even mess with it.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: The doctor told me to note things down if they were important, and she'd look up some possible causes before coming to fix me up a few days later.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Guess what? I muddle-fudgin' noted things down for several days straight! And that's when it hit me: I was remembering too much crap! That's why my memory module kept shutting down on me.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Is there a reason you're telling us this?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Hah! Yea, and it's simple.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: I'm telling you that it's not yourself you have to trust, but them.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Everyone here has a perfectly functional memory module. They didn't develop such robust brains to forget everything and become monkeys!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: So, you in?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Yes, let's get this party started.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: What was it again? An absurd solution to an absurd crisis? I won't call it that.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: It's only right for Dreamflux Reef's song to be untamed and free!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Go get the party started, singing queen—
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: No, I should call you "DJ queen" instead!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Let's go, Nameless gal. Or you can go grab a seat by yourself.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Beautiful, excellent... Music can really bring a film to life...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Holy forkeroni! Aren't you writing off your character?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I am, that's why I am watching this scene as a director instead of an actor.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I can't wait to hear for myself how this song of Harmony is going to turn out.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Sometimes I get hit by sudden hunches that a great film is in the making. More often than not, these tend to be just scenes from different groups of people that are then edited together.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Most of the characters in this film aren't what you would call protagonists. You don't really get to see full character arcs on them, but they still have a light in their hearts that can save humanity's soul.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: What do these people really need when they have lost everything? Guidance of the wise? Or aid from the strong?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: I'd say neither. All they need is a camera to capture them. That's when others would be able to see the most wonderful show in the entire universe.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Bah, don't make things sound so complicated, director pal! If you were to ask me...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Boothill]: Fork it, that's exactly what *life* is!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Mmm... It's the prelude. Can you hear it?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: "Those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on sigh."
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: "Told them something? Those suspensions, those solutions—'Must we die?'"
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: "Those commiserating sevenths—'Life might last! we can but try!'"
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: So, Miss Robin, is there anything else I can do?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I'm alright now. You don't have to accompany me any further. The butterflies that I felt from before are all gone now.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Is that because you're starting to get into the mood for the party early?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: No, that's not it. I just... realized something I've never noticed before.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Oh?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Everyone expected my life to change after going through something huge like that.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: But... that's not the case. I still haven't found a better answer regarding birds and flight.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Even when something comes to my mind, I still need a lot of time to deliberate on it and try various ways to prove it...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I believe my brother must be doing the same right now.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Micah]: Are you going to change yourself from today?
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Not exactly. It's just when I think about what's going to happen next, it dawns upon me that hymns tend to require a devoted heart and demand the choir to sing in unison...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: But on the dance floor, there's no need to conform or impose a certain standard for everyone to follow. Even if everyone is different, they will still appear the same.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: Perhaps Harmony was never about its audience, but about the light it provides. Much like how we see it now...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: There are more choices for the people than singing "in unison." Even if they were to contribute their own differing sounds, these can be strung together... That's what it means to "tune." I believe our song of Harmony will be able to embrace even discordant sounds.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Robin]: I will bring forth Dreamflux Reef's very own sound.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Yes, yes, more.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Finally, all preparations leading up to the climax are in place.
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Let us welcome, with bated breath, the beatific final act!
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: Switching to Trailblazer's POV...
[Asdanian Rhapsody][Narration]: When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret.

[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: Rappa, are you not done with your ninja tech yet?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Patience. As stated in the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions: "Hasty knitting produces poor fabric, as raging fires fail to cook meat through."
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Ha— Done! The Cosmic ninjutsu is ever-changing, so I present to you the Super Ninja Scroll!

[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: I have added the memory from earlier into this. If Ninja Gama does not lie, this will become the blade to slay those fiendlings.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: As long as we insert memories containing the ninja memetic virus into the Synesthesia Dreamscape, it will overwrite the existence of Slumbernana Monkey in the dream.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Ninja Hiryū, Ninja , I'm counting on the two of you to aid me in ending the Fiendling Chief's reversed dream!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Ninja , is there anything else the matter? This is no time to be dawdling.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Bana, about your memories...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: That's a story for another time. Nothing's more important than ensuring the safety of the countless people on this land of dreams.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Bana, about the Super Ninja Scroll...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: I have infused all the memories that Ninja Gama extracted into Dazzling Ninjutsu's colors. Spread this all over the evil realm, and it shall break the Evil Ninja's matrix. This is the ninja tech I previously studied.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: It's nothing, bana.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Ninja , we should get moving now. The nether fire that ravages the land of dreams can only be extinguished by ninjas like us.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: , the people in Paperfold University and Dreamflux Reef are still in grave danger. Let's set off... bana.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: You faintly hear the playful Banagibberish of monkeys outside the door, and the happy, cheerful, carefree tones make you feel a twinge of *banana* envy.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: , where are you going, bana?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Yeah, you came here to enjoy campus life, so why are you getting caught up in this mess? What do these *banana* troubles have to do with you anyway?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Your journey always seems like this]: forced to take risks, forced to strive, forced to solve problems, with no freedom at all. Can't you ever truly choose to "give the *banana* up"?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hey. You have more memetic viruses on you than the number of trashy Penaconian films released this month. If you wander outside and provoke those monkeys again, you're really going to be done for!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Don't listen to him. Make a truly free choice and embrace the *banana* freedom of a monkey's life!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Let's go, nana!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: An island full of bananas, a lovely nest for Slumbernanas!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Ba na na na~
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Eat bananas, nap the day away!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Worry no more, be happy everyday!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Slumbernana Monkey is the very best ♪
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: He's the monkey living life without a stress ♪
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Alas...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Ninja  was unable to resist the allure of fiendlings' evil.  trailblazing way of the ninja has now been severed!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: But upon entering the realm of fiendlings,  felt no more worries or suffering and spent  time with the ape-friends. When every day is drowned in joy, the rest of one's life will also become free and unfettered.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: After Ninja  fell like a deceitful star, the rest of the ninjas will also banananananaa...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Bana?

[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Cosmic Ninjutsu InscriptionsThe End
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Hold on, bana!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Phew! At the last possible moment, you conquered the inner Banagibberish.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: An ordinary camera. Had it not been made by a Memokeeper, it'd be hard to imagine that this thing could send you to another dreamscape.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: You peer through the viewfinder and spot what seems like the eye of an amphibian staring back at you. A familiar voice echoes in your ears—
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Actors, are you ready for the final act?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Action! Let's go, bana!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Charge with me, ninjas! Let the hunt begin!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Cut! Hold on a sec, bana.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: You halted the upcoming shoot — but to avoid turning your ninja hero role into a monkey, you need to get camera-ready fast.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Cosmic Ninjutsu InscriptionsThe Final Chapter]: Upturned Dreamfall
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Strange Noise]: Bana...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Strange Noise]: An island full of bananas, a lovely nest for Slumbernanas!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: The familiar Banagibberish rings out, and the monkeys in your mind start making noise...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Strange Noise]: ♪ Ba na na na~ Ba na na na~ ♪
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Dazzling Ninjutsu: Brilliant Enlightenment!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: ...The Banagibberish sounds from before have stopped.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: I shattered the fiendling's deception with my ninja talismans. Has everyone snapped out of their trance?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: Looks like Mr. Reca did tell the truth. Your memory worked in overwriting the Slumbernana Monkeys' influences. Our speech seems to have gone back to normal too.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: Is this the Moment of Slumbernana? This place is crawling with Slumbernana Monkeys. I'm guessing they're the Ripe Bananas from Paperfold University and Dreamflux Reef.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: I've been here before!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: This is the strange dream I mentioned!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: That is true. This is undoubtedly the illusory realm Ninja  and I had once visited. There were not as many fiendlings around back then. Looks like more and more people are being afflicted by the sorcery...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Fiendling Chief... You're behind all of this, aren't you?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Bana tsk, what a waste. If it wasn't for so many variables disrupting the plan, this place would have been even more bustling.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: You know what's even more of a waste? Your experiment's on its way to failure.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Let me make a guess. You want to destroy this place with the virus in her head?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": But look at all these monkeys! Do you really think that dated manga can replace the most fervent trend in the Dreamscape?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Of course that wouldn't work. Neither do I have any intentions of pushing ninja initiates to adopt the Way of the Dazzling Ninja.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: All we need to do is bring those disillusioned fans back to their senses to quell the rogue waves of fiendlings.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: There's no need to replace Slumbernana Monkeys with ninjas. We just have to snap them back to their senses. That alone is enough to undermine the influence of the memetic virus.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: And when people no longer blindly follow Slumbernana Monkey, we will be able to easily destroy this Dreamscape.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Hmph, looks like that Memokeeper gave you guys some banatips that good students shouldn't know about. In that case...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": I can only issue the "final exam" to you.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Bring it on. I'm ready for your challenge.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Laying down your challenge only to abscond? Despicable!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Stop right there!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Coward!!!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Hmph, think you can escape?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: I can't tell what's up his sleeve, but we should take care of these Slumbernana Monkeys as soon as possible. Stopping the memetic virus is still our priority for now.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Ninja Hiryū is right. Since I have already relinquished the Super Ninja Scroll, I'll rely on my fists to awaken these ninja initiates that succumbed to the way of the fiendling.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: There are too many monkeys. It's best that we try to eliminate them.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: My ninja arts will only send the fiendlings out of this place. But fret not, I can freely use my ninja fist!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Fashionable trends are what drive people. In the sweet dreams of Harmony, this is equivalent to strength.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: The Fiendling Chief left atop this ninja tech bullet! Let us quickly give chase!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Stop trying to escape. If you believe that you can defeat us, why not settle it once and for all right now!?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Bana bana bana, it's not time for class yet. There's no need to be in such a hurry.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Are these floating mantras the inner voices of those ninja initiates? It seems the Fiendling Chief's beguiling isn't the only reason they gave up on the way of the ninja.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: That's right. Life in Penacony is not as ideal as what is seen on the surface. If someone is standing on the edge of a cliff, even a gentle breeze can easily tip them over.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: We have to stop this breeze from growing. Even if the ninja initiates decide to make the leap, it should be a conscious choice of their own, and not sorcery that coerced them into it.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Monkeys don't have performance points to achieve.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: No need to worry about graduation.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Monkeys don't have performance to review.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: No worries about paychecks.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: No future to think of.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: No fear for tomorrow.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": How many of the experimental subjects' wishes have been collected inside the core so far? A thousand? Ten thousand?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": We should fully utilize what we have. These results will pave the way and eliminate any obstacles in our future experiments...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Hurry up and give chase. Come on, the classroom is just ahead.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Stop wasting your time on useless questions, it's almost time to hand in your papers...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: Hold on, it seems to be intentionally guiding us toward there...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: There's no need for hesitation, Ninja Hiryū. If there's an ambush, we foil the ambush. If there's a scheme, we thwart the scheme.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: The number of Slumbernana Monkeys seems to be declining. The virus must have also been weakened somewhat.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: There aren't many fiendlings left. This is cause for us to rejoice!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Slumbernana Monkey]: Bananana! Bananana!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: This bunch of monkeys seems like they are trying to stop us...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Then let us snap them all out of their disillusionment!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: This is the place where I met  before. It seems like the starting point of this formidable hunt will also be where it shall be concluded. How ingenious fate is...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: ...for the fiendlings to be here.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Bana... The experimental results have been so badly damaged. You're such a bunch of unruly students...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Fiendling Chief, there's nowhere left to run. It's time to face your punishment delivered by my Dazzling Ninjutsu!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": "AK-A-3," carrying high-quality primate genes selected from 32 civilizations for the atavistic experiment, went astray due to a trainee research ape's erroneous cultivation.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Moreover, that trainee research ape showed no remorse and even colluded with the Galaxy Rangers, resulting in a devastating loss for the laboratory. In the end, we're only left with an abysmal piece of "failure"...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: You're a fiendling who only knows how to take orders from the Evil Ninja and go around causing trouble. What right do you have to judge me?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Of course, it's because of... my dreams.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Let us continue from where the previous lecture left off: Bananas are plants that propagate asexually. Each rhizome can bear several buds that will grow into a sea of banana trees, thus eliminating hunger problems plaguing planets and perhaps even the entire universe.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": As for the selfish plants that place emphasis on personality and individuality, they will willfully spread their seeds and grow uncultivated. They only care about whether their genes are passed on but do not know to contribute to the cause of their kind.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Tell me, on a cosmic scale, which should be eliminated, and which should be left to thrive?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Enough! Just shut up.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: When school started, you encouraged everyone to pursue their desires freely, but now you ridicule what it means to be free. Previously, you judged bananas to be a failed plant, but now you are singing praises of their selflessness.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Ugh... This... The context is different. You can't generalize it in this manner...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: When evil people do evil things, they always have a myriad of excuses to try and justify their own actions.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: You're self-contradictory and unreasonable, only striving to further your own agenda. There's no need to listen to such lessons!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Fiendling Chief, rather than continuing to weave lies, why don't you think about your last words!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Class is dismissed!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: School is over!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Time for graduation!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Failures... A bunch of failures that cannot be cultivated.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": How can failures possibly comprehend the Erudition of a genius? However, I can always rely on primitive methods to banaducate you on this theory...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": See this beautiful dream bubble? The Family relied on the Harmonious wishes of thousands of Family members and the power of the Stellaron to construct Penacony. But I simply gathered and converged the abandoned wishes of thousands of monkeys into this dream bubble to create the Moment of Slumbernana.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Now, I will hand over its power to all BananAdvisors and Assistananas...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Bana Bana Bana... Students, it's time for the final lessonana.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": The name of this class is...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Dreaming!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Fiendlings, be gone! Ultimate Brilliant Enlightenment!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dreamweaving BananAdvisor]: Bana wha! Holy bananas... The power of the Slumbernana Monkey has disappeared...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Fortune BananAdvisor]: You bunch of unruly students have seriously violated the banacademic code of conduct.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Fortune BananAdvisor]: Bana bana bana! Prepare to be disciplined!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][BananAdvisors]: Violence is the most primitive form of Erudition — this is the power of Bananenlightenment!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: )
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][BananAdvisors]: Banacademics failed...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": A failed lessonana...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": Unattainable dreams... are just like... the highest-hangeing — OUCH bana!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Mission. Accomplished!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Agh!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Perplexed Classmate]: What is this place... Wasn't I just in class?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Confounded Resident]: Where have the... bananas and forest gone...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: , Dan Heng! And... Miss Rappa?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Yo, Ninja Ruri! Yo, Silvergun Shura!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: Forkin' hell, they are making more of a scene than we are.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": How can it be... How could such mighty aspirations be brought down by a bunch of failed kindling...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Fiendling Chief, stop insulting others with your filthy language. The way of the ninja does not discriminate between classes...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: One who seeks the way of the ninja is a Ninja Initiate. One who upholds the way of the ninja is a Ninja. And one who lives by the way of the ninja... is a Ninja Hero!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": ...I don't understand, bana.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: Me neither... Wait, no more nonsense. There's no point in continuing the conversation with a monkey brought up by Dr. Primitive.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: Have you decided on what to do with this guy?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: Torture is definitely on the menu. Hah, whip him with a belt soaked in saltwater and serve him everything that the IPC once used on me.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: The Fiendling Chief is guilty of multiple sins and deserves punishment. However, repentance is not what we seek, instead...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Rappa & Boothill: Make him tell us where Evil Ninja Osaru is. / Make him tell us where Dr. Primitive is.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: Yo, you enjoy playing dead? Let's see if you can still play dead in the face of a banana covered with thorns!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Alright, cowboy actor, you don't have to continue acting with that puppet.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: A puppet? You lil' fudgehead, even your toad looks more like a puppet than he does.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Assistant Director": ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: You've hurt the feelings of the assistant director. You really should work on changing your crude way of delivering lines.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Go ahead if you really want to torture a prop. But a certain gorilla who has just awakened at the border of Asdana is probably about to depart.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: "Profnana": ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Silvergun Shura, even with my super hearing, I'm no longer able to detect the sounds of the fiendling. Perhaps Ninja Gama is right.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: He escaped?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: A truly despicable fiendling!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: Forkin' hell! That muddle-fudger still got away even after all our effort?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: ...Forget it.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Boothill]: Gal, why are you so calm? You're always talking about how much you hate that scum. Why are you so unconcerned right now?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: This night is long. The hatred of a Ninja Hero should be borne solely by themselves. Since Pinecany has finally ushered in a period of peace and prosperity, then let the mortal beings of this land of dreams embrace the sun once more.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: The hatred in one's heart might dissipate one day, but the way of the ninja within their hearts will never be forgotten... ever.

[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Master Kucha]: Rappa, have you found your own way of the ninja?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Of course, becoming the Dazzling Ninja is my way of the ninja.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Master Kucha]: No, that cannot be considered the way of the ninja. The way of the ninja is something a ninja lives by for the rest of their life.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Then... defeating the Evil Ninja?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Master Kucha]: You'll eventually defeat Evil Ninja Osaru one day. Then, what happens next? Is your reason for becoming the Dazzling Ninja solely for defeating your enemies?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: ...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: But he's not the only Evil Ninja in this realm, right?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Master Kucha]: Of course... In the Cosmic Ninja Realm, evildoers are as abundant as the glittering stars. The gods have no spare attention to protect the mortals and the powerful ninja masters with extraordinary ninjutsu powers constantly fighting against one another. That is the Mappou Age of the Dharma.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Then, my way of the ninja shall be...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Eradicating evil, till my last breath. My bow drawn, no turning back. My heart shall remain unmoved until evil has been purged and justice enacted!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Till the end of the Mappou Age.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: CUT! Perfect!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Stinger]: After the storm dies down, Paperfold University starts to re-organize the school anniversary festival..
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: You guys actually experienced something so exciting... Seriously, bring me along on such adventures next time!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: It was clearly you who went off on your own.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Forget it. Anyway, I was also able to showcase my capabilities while you guys weren't present. I definitely played a big part in your being able to resolve the situation so successfully.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Really?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: O—Of course!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Wow, you're the best.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Hey, why do you sound so snarky...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: As expected of Ninja Ruri!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: You're too kind, Ninja .
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: The academic conference has concluded, and the actual acting dean and teachers are back.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: The university did not escalate matters... Perhaps it's because Mr. Reca extracted a portion of the people's memories.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: How scary, could he have taken our memories as well? I don't want to lose any more memories.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: However, it's all thanks to him that the Dreamlight Anniversary is going ahead once again. I hope that we can finally have some fun this time!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: Yes, and I heard that Miss Robin is going to host the new opening ceremony in the Plaza. Let's head over and take a look.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Isn't that Montana and the other classmates? They're back!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Look! It's Himeko and Mr. Yang!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Hi Montana, are you feeling alright?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: Yo, Ninja March.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Huh? What?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: Hmm? Don't you know, this is the most popular meme right now. It originated from Mr. Reca's latest work, the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: That guy... I don't think he has paid our salary yet... By the way, Montana, do you still like Slumbernana Monkey?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: Slumbernana Monkey? Haha, that's so last year.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Last year? Just yesterday at Dreamflux Reef, you were...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: Dreamflux Reef? Where is that?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: Alright March 7th, the latest trend now is the Cosmic Ninjutsu Inscriptions! You have to keep up with the trends!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: I'm going to the Ninja Appreciation Society's event now. Do you want to come along?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: N—No thanks! I'm heading to the opening ceremony of the Dreamlight Anniversary!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Montana]: Understood — then farewell, Ninja March.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: That's Ninja Ruri to you! Farewell!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Dan Heng]: So, is this what they mean by the rise and fall of trends in Penacony...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Richie's Father: Son, I've thought it through. If you're too tired, let's just return to our hometown...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Richie]: No, Dad, I'm not going back.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Richie]: I've earned a fortune during the anniversary celebration — even though I don't do well in my theory courses, I can still become a salesperson in the future and make a great living!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Richie]: Just watch, Dad. I'll be sure to make a name for myself in Penacony!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Richie's Father: Son... Heh, as your dad, perhaps I should also try a little harder...

[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Satisfied Classmate]: Chaletka, the desserts that you made are so delicious!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Greedy Classmate]: Give me one more, give me one more!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Chaletka]: F—Fellow students... There's enough for everyone, so please queue up!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Sweet-tongued Classmate: Chaletka, you're simply a genius of dessert making.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Chaletka]: Th—Thank you! Maybe becoming a patissier... after graduating doesn't sound too bad either...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: :
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: :
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Gossipy Classmate]: Nanabloom-chan, I heard you're going to be featured in Mr. Reca's new film!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Ahahaha, I'm just going to be a minor character.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Gossipy Classmate]: I'm sure you'll become a superstar one day. Can I get your autograph in advance?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Nanabloom-chan: Of course... Here, take it!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Gossipy Classmate]: Thank you. But who is this... Gabbana?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Gabbana]: That's my name — I'm not going to use a stage name anymore. So, if you're going to be my fan, please remember that my name is Gabbana.

[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: :
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][March 7th]: Himeko, Mr. Yang, you're here as well!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Welt]: That's right. We heard the anniversary celebration had been delayed, so we wrapped up the conference early and came straight here to see if we could catch the fun.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Himeko]: How was it? Did you enjoy your time on campus?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: It was amazing.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Welt]: Glad to hear it. People say that academic years are some of the happiest of their lives. I'm sure you'll be leaving with fond memories.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: It wasn't fun at all!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Welt]: Haha, not an eager student, ? Never mind — life itself is a journey of study, the universe a boundless ocean of learning.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: We ran into some trouble...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Welt]: Is that so? Sounds like student life wasn't boring after all. Look on the bright side — sometimes the most memorable things are the accidents of our youth.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Himeko]: Look! Miss Robin is here...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: Hello, students. I'm very happy to be hosting the Dreamlight Anniversary this year.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Excited Student]: Oh gosh, it really is Miss Robin! The opening ceremony this year is much better than last time!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Confused Student]: Hold on, who was the speaker last time?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Excited Student]: Uhhhhh... I don't remember.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: A long time ago, I also spent some time studying at Paperfold University. So, I can be considered an alumnus of the school.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: Paperfold University back then was just like how it is right now. There was a lack of freedom, exams were a source of headaches, we had plenty of homework, and our thesis defense had stringent requirements... Well, it can't be helped since this place bears the burden of training the future of Penacony.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: The annual Dreamlight Anniversary is the opportunity for students to temporarily toss their troubles aside. However, the anniversary celebrations will come to an end, just like how... we'll eventually awaken from our dreams.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: But there is a type of dream that we will never awaken from, and should never awaken from...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: And that is the dreams woven by our highest ambitions.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: Some students wish to create beautiful objects, while others desire to lead amazing lives. There are some who even wish to become a better person. These are all amazing dreams.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: In our lives, dreams act as beacons that guide us forward. Once we have lit up the beacon, we may choose to rest at any time. This does not signify that we have given up, for as long as the light of the beacon can be seen, we will have the courage to restart our journey.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: I hope that all of you will be able to find your dreams at Paperfold University and will dedicate your lives to realizing them.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: It is because of your sweet dreams that you can create color. It is because of your ideals that you can embrace freedom.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Robin]: Welcome to Dreamlight Anniversary! Color your dreams, free your ideals!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Fellow Students]: Color your dreams, free your ideals!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Color your dreams, free your ideals!
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Despite the similarities to the Evil Realm, there are no clues here...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: ...Yo, Ninja Gama.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: How I wish that in the next film, you can call me something better, my wonderful actor.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Are you alone?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Each Ninja Hero has their own prey. Silvergun Shura only came to repay a favor, after which he returned to his own hunt.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: Is anything the matter?
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Hehe, after helping me shoot such an exciting film, I'm here to hand you your remuneration.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Rappa]: A reward won't be necessary. I'm only acting according to my way of the ninja. Riches are not what I desire.
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: Don't say that. I'm sure you'll be very interested in my remuneration. After all, this remuneration is...
[Battles Without Ninja and Humanity][Narration]: Mr. Reca: ...about where Dr. Primitive went.
